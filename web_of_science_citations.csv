Epistemic spillovers: Learning others' political views reduces the ability to assess and use their expertise in nonpolitical domains.,Cognition,2019-Jul,2019,"On political questions, many people prefer to consult and learn from those whose political views are similar to their own, thus creating a risk of echo chambers or information cocoons. We test whether the tendency to prefer knowledge from the politically like-minded generalizes to domains that have nothing to do with politics, even when evidence indicates that politically like-minded people are less skilled in those domains than people with dissimilar political views. Participants had multiple opportunities to learn about others' (1) political opinions and (2) ability to categorize geometric shapes. They then decided to whom to turn for advice when solving an incentivized shape categorization task. We find that participants falsely concluded that politically like-minded others were better at categorizing shapes and thus chose to hear from them. Participants were also more influenced by politically like-minded others, even when they had good reason not to be. These results replicate in two independent samples. The findings demonstrate that knowing about others' political views interferes with the ability to learn about their competency in unrelated tasks, leading to suboptimal information-seeking decisions and errors in judgement. Our findings have implications for political polarization and social learning in the midst of political divisions.",199
Affective Ties That Bind: Investigating the Affordances of Social Networking Sites for Commemoration of Traumatic Events,SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW,Jun 2019,2019,"Social networking sites (SNSs) facilitate self-expression and promote social connections. There has been growing scholarly attention to the affect-charged collectivities created online in the aftermath of disasters and mass traumas. This study was designed to examine how individuals affiliate in SNS-based commemoration of a mass trauma, taking advantage of a large Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter) data set which captures users' responses over 4 years to the anniversary of the Nanjing massacre, a major traumatic event in Chinese history. Machine learning-based content analysis was combined with dyadic-level network analysis to examine the content Weibo users create and the conversational structures they formed. The results reveal that homophily, geographic proximity, and preferential attachment work in tandem with displays of emotion to influence the formation of online conversational ties. Expressions of negative emotions were found to facilitate or inhibit the homophily effect. Being exposed to the display of anger amplifies the homophily effect among the users, while sadness weakens it. The findings point to the importance of examining specific emotions rather than global (positive-negative) feelings in understanding the dynamics of SNS-based interaction.",181
"Sociocultural, economic and ethnic homogeneity in residential mobility and spatial sorting among couples",ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,Jun 2019,2019,"This study aims to advance the spatial conceptualization of 'social homophily' by relating the match, or mismatch, between a household's social and sociocultural characteristics and the characteristics of the neighbourhood of residence to the probability of moving away from that neighbourhood. Three matching dimensions were investigated: economic status, ethnic background and sociocultural disposition. This paper's focus is on the sociocultural dimension because this has not been included extensively in large-scale research so far. Initially we investigate how level of education at the household level interacts with education composition at the neighbourhood level. To further investigate the sociocultural dimension, we then include the share of each partner's income in the total household income in our analyses. Based on the spatial literature at the intersections of class, gender and family, we assume that, together with higher education, the intra-household distribution of income reflects a broader set of sociocultural values. We make use of large-N register data to analyse the residential and mobility behaviour of all registered stable couples in the four largest Dutch urban regions between 2008 and 2009. Our analyses indicate that the degree to which a household 'matches' its social surroundings negatively affects its probability of leaving. This is the case for all three dimensions, with sociocultural disposition having the largest effect. The conclusion reflects on the importance of these findings for social homophily, sorting and residential segregation, and proposes directions for further research.",234
"Examining similarities in eating pathology, negative affect, and perfectionism among peers: A social network analysis",APPETITE,Jun 1 2019,2019,"Friends tend to be more similar than non-friends (i.e., exhibit homophily) in body image concerns and disordered eating behaviors. These similarities may be accounted for by similarities in eating disorder risk factors and correlates. The current study sought to replicate findings of homophily for eating pathology using social network analysis and to test if similarity in eating pathology is present above and beyond homophily for eating disorder risk factors and correlates. College students (n = 89) majoring in nutrition completed a social network assessment and measures of eating pathology (i.e., body dissatisfaction, binge eating, restricting, excessive exercise), negative affect, and perfectionism. Homophily for eating pathology, negative affect, and perfectionism were tested as predictors of friendship ties using exponential random graph modeling, adjusting for gender, year in school, and body mass index. Results did not support homophily for eating pathology. However, restricting was associated with a lower likelihood of friendship ties. Homophily was present for perfectionism, but not for negative affect. Results suggest that eating pathology may influence the propensity to form friendships and account for previous findings of homophily in the literature. Homophily for perfectionism may have also driven previous findings for homophily. More longitudinal work using social network analysis is needed to understand the role that personality plays in peer influences on eating pathology.",234
Early prediction of the outcome of Kickstarter campaigns: is the success due to virality?,PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS,May 14 2019,2019,"The spread of information, opinions, preferences, and behavior across social media is a crucial feature of the current functioning of our economy, politics, and culture. One of the emerging channels for spreading social collective action and funding of novelty in all these domains is Crowdfunding on various platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Sellaband, and may others. The exact spreading mechanism of this collective action is not well-understood. The general belief is that virality plays a crucial role. Namely, the common hypothesis is that the information or behavior propagates through individuals affecting one another, presumably, through the links connecting them in social networks. The aim of our study is to find out the actual spreading mechanism in one particular case: spread of financial support for individual Kickstarter campaigns. To our surprise, our studies show that ""virality"" plays here only a minor role. We used this result to construct a simple behavior-grounded stochastic predictor of the success of Kickstarter campaigns which is not based on the viral mechanism. The crucial feature of the model underlying the prediction algorithm is that the success of a campaign depends less on the backers influencing one another (""virality"") but rather on the campaign appealing to a particular class of high-pledge backers. This appeal is usually revealed at the very beginning of the campaign and it is an excellent success predictor. The case of Kickstarter is consistent with a recently proposed generic hypothesis that popularity in social media arises more from independent responses by individuals belonging to a large homophily class rather than from percolation, self-exciting processes, and other cooperative mechanisms resulting from mutual influence between individuals. Thus, the very concept of ""virality"", which implies contagion between participating individuals, plays only a minor role in the success mechanism proposed hereby. A more appropriate term for the mechanism underlying the social success in our model could be ""social appeal"" or ""social fitness"".",314
Inequality Beyond Networking: Personal Networks and Mobilization of Contacts by Young Job Seekers in Barcelona,REVISTA ESPANOLA DE SOCIOLOGIA,May 2019,2019,"How young job seekers mobilize their contacts in the labour market? We look at mobilization of personal networks of young adults in Barcelona. We consider the strength of ties and status homophily as mechanisms of personal networks as for the consolidation of social capital. Our qualitative analysis of 18 interviews with job seekers explores their personal networks and labour market trajectories. We applied Social Network Analysis (SNA). Our analysis of social capital indicates the existence of a relation between the cultural and economic capitals of job seekers and the compositional features of their networks. Results show how networks are similarly heterogeneous in terms of strength of ties, and mostly homophilous in educational levels. But these similarities in terms of social capital come with sharp inequalities in the patterns of mobilized contacts and their success in finding a job. These differences can be explained by the type and volume of capitals of job seekers. Those with better positions in the social structure and stable trajectories seem to mobilize fewer contacts more efficiently, getting better outcomes.",174
The Dark Side of Deeply Meaningful Work: Work-Relationship Turmoil and the Moderating Role of Occupational Value Homophily,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES,May 2019,2019,"How are close personal relationships experienced by people in deeply meaningful work? Drawing upon in-depth interview data with 82 international aid workers, I offer three distinct contributions. First, I find that people who experience their work as deeply meaningful have high work devotion. I identify boundary inhibition as a mechanism to explain why they participate more willingly in overwork and erratic work, despite giving rise to time- and trust-based conflict in their relationships. Second, I find that people with high work devotion often also experience emotional distance in their personal relationships when their close others don't value their work - a context I call occupational value heterophily. This disconnection-based conflict compounds the time- and trust-based conflict and engenders an emotionally agonizing situation, which I call work-relationship turmoil. Third, when close others do value their partner's work - a context I call occupational value homophily - it fosters an emotional connection and offers an avenue for work-relationship enrichment. These findings draw upon deeply meaningful work to detail the multi-faceted work-relationship experience among those with high work devotion.",173
Rational choices: an ecological approach,THEORY AND DECISION,May 2019,2019,"We address the oft-repeated criticism that the demands which the rational choice approach makes on the knowledge and cognition of a decision-maker (DM) are way beyond the capabilities of typical human intelligence. Our key finding is that it may be possible to arrive at this ideal of rationality by means of cognitively less demanding, heuristic-based ecological reasoning that draws on information about others' choices in the DM's environment. Formally, we propose a choice procedure under which, in any choice problem, the DM, first, uses this information to shortlist a set of alternatives. The DM does this shortlisting by a mental process of categorization, whereby she draws similarities with certain societal membersthe ingroupand distinctions from othersthe outgroupand considers those alternatives that are similar (dissimilar) to ingroup (outgroup) members' choices. Then, she chooses from this shortlisted set by applying her preferences, which may be incomplete owing to limitations of knowledge. We show that, if a certain homophily condition connecting the DM's preferences with her ingroup-outgroup categorization holds, then the procedure never leads the DM to making bad choices. If, in addition, a certain shortlisting consistency condition holds vis-a-vis non-comparable alternatives under the DM's preferences, then the procedure results in rational choices.",199
"I can only be properly myself when I'm with her': Early adolescent intra-ethnic immigrant group friendships as a safe space for identity exploration, negotiation and validation",CHILDHOOD-A GLOBAL JOURNAL OF CHILD RESEARCH,May 2019,2019,"Intra-ethnic adolescent friendships can provide a safe space for the development of a sense of identity and belonging and this study explores the intra-ethnic friendship experiences of fifteen 11- to 12-year olds with non-Irish heritage in Ireland. The incorporation of principles and practices from expressive arts psychotherapy into creative focus groups and journaling within the governing framework of Dahlberg et al.'s reflective lifeworld approach provides different sensory pathways designed to optimise participant expression. Findings indicate that these friendships provide an affirming context for identity exploration, negotiation and enactment, with the journaling activity evoking more personal in-depth disclosures.",97
Understanding the Psycho-Sociological Facets of Homophily in Social Network Communities,IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE,May 2019,2019,"Community in social networks is a nebulous concept. A community is generally assumed to be formed by people who possess similar attributes or characteristics, also known as ""homophily"". Although there has been a lot of research on community detection based on network topology, the semantic interpretation of communities is rarely studied. The present work aims to understand the behavioral similarity of users present in their personal neighborhood communities formed by friends, relatives, or colleagues, and addresses two fundamental questions: (i) Are communities firmed by users who possess similar behavioral traits? If so, does this apply to all those sub-networks, i.e., friends, relatives, and colleagues? (ii) Does adding behavioral node-specific attributes/features to the nodes in a network lead to better community detection? To better understand the psycho-sociological homophilic nature of personal networks, the personalities and values of Twitter users were analyzed using the well-established ""Big-5 personality model"" and ""Schwartz sociological behavior model"". Empirical results based on the psychosociological behavior show that friends networks exhibit homophily, whereas relatives and colleagues networks do not exhibit such homophilic behavior. It can also be observed that neurotic people tend to behave heterogeneously with people of various personality traits. In addition, it is shown that such empirical evidence can be used as features for the tasks of community detection and link prediction.",217
Gender homophily in online book networks,INFORMATION SCIENCES,May 2019,2019,"We measure the gender homophily (and other network statistics) on large-scale online book markets: amazon. corn and amazon. co. uk, using datasets describing millions of books sold to readers. Large book networks are created by sales (two books are connected if many readers have bought both books) and can recommend new books to buy. The networks are analysed by the gender of their first author: is book consumption assortative by gender?Book networks are indeed gender-assortative: readers globally prefer to read from one author gender (the global assortativity coefficients by gender is around 0.4). Although 33% of first authors among all books are female, female books are not proportionally sold together with male books: an average of 20% (and median of 11%) of books co-bought with male books are female books. Instead, female books make up on average more than half of the books co-bought with other female books.The gender makeup of literary genres and structural book communities show that the gender homophily originates in a gender skew not only in certain literary genres (a fact known from prior studies), but even more strongly in certain book communities, with these book communities spanning multiple literary genres.

How MPs ties to interest groups matter for legislative co-sponsorship,SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2019,2019,"This article investigates whether linkages between members of parliament (MPs) and interest groups influence MPs' activities of co-sponsoring legislative proposals. Based on statistical models for network data, the study builds on classical explanations of co-sponsorships highlighting the role of similar ties between MPs, such as party membership, legislative committee assignments, electoral district or gender. It shows that, on top of these traditional forms of homophily, MPs' ties to interest groups matter as well. MPs with ties to a similar type of interest groups are more likely to co-sponsor their respective proposals. The same holds for MPs with ties to groups active in the same policy domain. These findings have implications for the study of groups' lobbying, legislative behaviour and representative democracy.",121
Multiplicative coevolution regression models for longitudinal networks and nodal attributes,SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2019,2019,"We introduce a simple and extendable coevolution model for the analysis of longitudinal network and nodal attribute data. The model features parameters that describe three phenomena: homophily, contagion and autocorrelation of the network and nodal attribute process. Homophily here describes how changes to the network may be associated with between-node similarities in terms of their nodal attributes. Contagion refers to how node-level attributes may change depending on the network. The model we present is based upon a pair of intertwined autoregressive processes. We obtain least-squares parameter estimates for continuous-valued fully observed network and attribute data. We also provide methods for Bayesian inference in several other cases, including ordinal network and attribute data, and models involving latent nodal attributes. These model extensions are applied to an analysis of international relations data and to data from a study of teen delinquency and friendship networks.",142
Researchers collaborate with same-gendered colleagues more often than expected across the life sciences,PLOS ONE,Apr 26 2019,2019,"Evidence suggests that women in academia are hindered by conscious and unconscious biases, and often feel excluded from formal and informal opportunities for research collaboration. In addition to ensuring fairness and helping to redress gender imbalance in the academic workforce, increasing women's access to collaboration could help scientific progress by drawing on more of the available human capital. Here, we test whether researchers tend to collaborate with same-gendered colleagues, using more stringent methods and a larger dataset than in past work. Our results reaffirm that researchers co-publish with colleagues of the same gender more often than expected by chance, and show that this 'gender homophily' is slightly stronger today than it was 10 years ago. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that homophily is driven mostly by senior academics, and no evidence that homophily is stronger in fields where women are in the minority. Interestingly, journals with a high impact factor for their discipline tended to have comparatively low homophily, as predicted if mixed-gender teams produce better research. We discuss some potential causes of gender homophily in science.",180
An adaptive temporal-causal network model for social networks based on the homophily and more-becomes-more principle,NEUROCOMPUTING,Apr 21 2019,2019,"This study describes the use of adaptive temporal-causal networks to model and simulate the development of mutually interacting opinion states and connections between individuals in social networks. The focus is on adaptive networks combining the homophily principle with the more becomes more principle. The model has been used to analyse a data set concerning opinions about the use of alcohol and tobacco, and friendship relations. The achieved results provide insights in the potential of the approach. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.",
Community detection in facebook activity networks and presenting a new multilayer label propagation algorithm for community detection,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B,Apr 20 2019,2019,"The emergence of online social networks has revolutionized millions of web users' behavior so that their interactions with each other produce huge amounts of data on different activities. Community detection, herein, is one of the most important tasks. The very recent trend is to detect meaningful communities based on users' interactions or the activity network. However, in many of such studies, authors consider the basic network model while almost ignoring the model of the interactions in the multi-layer network. In this research, an experimental study is done to compare community detection in Facebook friendship network to that of activity network, considering different activities in Facebook OSN such as sharing. Then, a new community detection evaluation metric based on homophily is proposed. Eventually, a new method of community detection based on different activities in Facebook social network is presented. In this method, we generalized three familiar similarity methods, Jaccard, Common Neighbors and Adamic-Adar for multi-layered network model.",
"The ""Other Side of The Fence"": A Learning- And Control-Based Investigation Of The Relationship Between Deviance And Friendship Quality",DEVIANT BEHAVIOR,,2019,"Utilizing frameworks of social control and differential association theories, this study addresses the extent to which deviance (a predictor) is related to friendship quality (the outcome). Using dyadic data, results demonstrate that the highest estimates of friendship quality come from actors who have non-deviant friends and who also refrain from theft and violence themselves. Shared deviance within the friendship, referred to as 'homophily,' harms friendship quality, although it does not mediate or moderate the deviance - friendship quality link. Overall, deviance relates to friendship quality in a way that supports a bonding tradition more than a learning tradition.",
Networked individualism and learning in organizations An ego-network perspective on informal learning ties,JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING,Apr 3 2019,2019,"Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the extent professionals from the vocational sector are networked individuals. The authors explore how professionals use their personal networks to engage in a wide variety of learning activities and examine what social mechanisms influence professionals' agency to form personal informal learning networks.Design/methodology/approach - This study applied a mixed- method approach to data collection. Social network data were gathered among school professionals working in the vocational sector. Ego- network analysis was performed. A total of 24 in- depth, semi- structured, qualitative interviews were analyzed.Findings - This study found that networked individualism is not represented to its full potential in the vocational sector. However, it is important to form informal learning ties with different stakeholders because all types of informal learning ties serve different learning purposes. The extent to which social mechanisms (i. e. proximity, trust, level of expertise and homophily) influence professionals' agency to form informal learning ties differs depending on the stakeholder with whom the informal learning ties are formed.Research limitations/implications - This study excludes the investigation of social mechanisms that shape learning through more impersonal virtual learning resources, such as social media or expert forums. Moreover, the authors only included individual- and dyadic- level socialmechanisms. Practical implications - By investigating the social mechanisms that shape informal learning ties, this study provides insights how professionals can be stimulated to build rich personal learning networks in the vocational sector.Originality/value - The authors extend earlier research with in- depth information on the different types of learning activities professionals engage in in their personal learning networks with different stakeholders. The ego- network perspective reveals how different social mechanisms influence professionals' agency to shape informal learning networks with different stakeholders.",
The Earnings of Immigrant and Native-Born Men in Canada: The Role of Social Networks and Social Capital,SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,Apr 3 2019,2019,"Using data from the Canadian General Social Survey (2008), this study considers the role of social networks in immigrants' earnings. Despite higher levels of education, immigrants continue to earn less than native-born Canadians. This paper shows that social network characteristics are associated with earnings net of the effects of human capital and visible minority status. Social networks are important for understanding immigrants' earnings both as a direct cause of employment disadvantages and as a force that exacerbates the disadvantages that immigrants face due to racial discrimination, a lack of proficiency in Canada's official languages, and/or discrepancies over foreign credentials. While most current data on immigrant networks is limited to specific ethnic groups, cities, and/or occupations, the present study contributes to scholarship by generalizing data to all immigrants in Canada. This study also expands the temporal scope by comparing immigrants who arrived in the 2000s, 1990s, and earlier. Future research and public policy should put greater emphasis on the role of social networks in the economic integration of new immigrants.",
The Impact of Relational Characteristics on Consumer Responses to Word of Mouth on Social Networking Sites,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE,Apr 3 2019,2019,"Previous research has consistently found an effect of the valence (positive vs. negative) of electronic word of mouth in general and of word of mouth on a social networking site (sWOM) specifically on consumer responses. The current study investigates how interpersonal and person-to-site relational characteristics (homophily, tie strength, and source credibility) moderate this effect on consumer responses to sWOM (behavioral and positive word-of-mouth intention). The results show that interpersonal homophily and source credibility both significantly reinforce the effect of sWOM valence on behavioral intention and positive word-of-mouth intention. Only considering person-to-site relational characteristics as antecedents, (person-to-site) homophily and source credibility reinforce the effect of sWOM valence on behavioral intention and on positive word-of-mouth intention. However, including both the interpersonal and the person-to-site relational characteristics as antecedents results in all person-to-site relational characteristics becoming nonsignificant as moderators. This study advances the sWOM literature by concurrently examining how both interpersonal and person-to site relational characteristics moderate the effect of message valence on sWOM responses. The findings imply that marketers should try to stimulate sWOM from credible sources that are homophilous to the target audience, as these relationships reinforce the positive impact of sWOM valence on behavioral intentions.",
Homophily around specialized foraging underlies dolphin social preferences,BIOLOGY LETTERS,Apr 2019,2019,"Individuals often associate socially with those who behave the same way. This principle, homophily, could structure populations into distinct social groups. We tested this hypothesis in a bottlenose dolphin population that appeared to be clustered around a specialized foraging tactic involving cooperation with net-casting fishermen, but in which other potential drivers of such social structure have never been assessed. We measured and controlled for the contribution of sex, age, genetic relatedness, home range and foraging tactics on social associations to test for homophily effects. Dolphins tended to group with others having similar home ranges and frequency of using the specialized foraging tactic, but not other traits. Such social preferences were particularly clear when dolphins were not foraging, showing that homophily extends beyond simply participating in a specific tactic. Combined, these findings highlight the need to account for multiple drivers of group formation across behavioural contexts to determine true social affiliations. We suggest that homophily around behavioural specialization can be a major driver of social patterns, with implications for other social processes. If homophily based on specialized tactics underlies animal social structures more widely, then it may be important in modulating opportunities for social learning, and therefore influence patterns of cultural transmission.",
Homophily and the Persistence of Disagreement,ECONOMIC JOURNAL,Apr 2019,2019,"This article studies the persistence of disagreement using a dynamic model in which individuals update their attitudes by averaging those of others with whom they relate. Individuals establish homophilous relations and thus favour others with similar (dichotomous) attributes. Attributes determine the intensity of relations to the extent to which there is a substantial difference in attitudes between the two groups of individuals possessing and lacking them. The main finding is that disagreement, which materialises in two different groups of thinking, persists if and only if individuals develop sufficiently intense relations over time with others similar in one specific attribute. Relations with dissimilar others deteriorate and thus these two groups emerge.",
Improving health communication with photographic images that increase identification in three minority populations,HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH,Apr 2019,2019,"The homophily principle, that perceived similarities among people produce positive reactions, is a cross-cultural, global phenomenon. This study aimed to test the prediction that photographs that depict models similar to the target population improve health communication by increasing perceived identification in three racial/ethnic populations. Three separate nationally representative stratified samples (n = 1638) of African American, Hispanic and Native American adults were drawn from GfK's Knowledge Panel. Participants read a message advocating increased physical activity and improved diets and completed measures on behavioral intentions, outcome and self-efficacy expectations and identification. The message contained photographs from a stock photograph service or photographs created for the research project to match the three minority populations, Real Health Photos (RHP). Structural equation modeling confirmed the theoretical hypothesis that RHP which matched the minority population increased behavioral intentions and was mediated by identification (P < 0.05) in all three racial/ethnic minority samples. Messages with only half of the matched RHP images had these same positive indirect effects among African Americans and Hispanics (P < 0.05). The impact of matching visual images in health messages to recipients derived from identification with the characters in images. Homophily and identification are hardwired, evolutionary, biological phenomena that should be capitalized on health educators with minority populations.",
Do psychopathic birds of a feather flock together? Psychopathic personality traits and romantic preferences,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY,Apr 2019,2019,"Objective: The goal of the present studies was to investigate whether people are especially attracted to psychopathic traits, and whether there are individual differences in such attraction.Method: Female undergraduates (N= 270; M-age =19; 57% White, 20% Asian, 8% Black) and female and male community members (N=426; M-age = 37; 56% female; 81% Caucasian, 10% African American, 4% Asian) reported on their own personality and constructed their ideal mate for a dating, short-term, and long-term relationship from a list of 70 characteristics drawn from well-validated criteria for psychopathic personality and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5 personality disorders (PDs).Results: Across both studies, absolute romantic preferences for psychopathic traits collapsed across time point were low on average, but higher than those for most all other PDs. In addition, they were higher for Factor 1 (i.e., interpersonal/affective) as opposed to Factor 2 (i.e., impulsive, antisocial) psychopathy traits. Participants with marked PD features, including Factor 2 psychopathy traits, were more inclined than others to endorse a preference for psychopathic males.Conclusions: Relative attraction to psychopathic males and observed homophily may be avenues through which psychopathic traits persist in the population across time.",
Endogenous Changes in Public Opinion Dynamics,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Mar 31 2019,2019,"Opinion dynamics models usually center on explaining how macro-level regularities in public opinion (uniformity, polarization or clusterization) emerge as the effect of local interactions of a population with an initial random distribution of opinions. However, with only a few exceptions, the understanding of patterns of public opinion change has generally been dismissed in this literature. To address this theoretical gap in our understanding of opinion dynamics, we built a multi-agent simulation model that could help to identify some mechanisms underlying changes in public opinion. Our goal was to build a model whose behavior could show different types of endogenously (not induced by the researcher) triggered transitions (rapid or slow, radical or soft). The paper formalizes a situation where agents embedded in different types of networks (random, small world and scale free networks) interact with their neighbors and express an opinion that is the result of different mechanisms: a coherence mechanism, in which agents try to stick to their previously expressed opinions; an assessment mechanism, in which agents consider available external information on the topic; and a social influence mechanism, in which agents tend to approach their neighbor's opinions. According to our findings, only scale-free networks show fluctuations in public opinion. Public opinion changes in this model appear as a diffusion process of individual opinion shifts that is triggered by an opinion change of a highly connected agent. The frequency, rapidity and radicalness of the diffusion, and hence of public opinion fluctuations, positively depends on how influential external information is in individual opinions and negatively depends on how homophilic social interactions are.",
Offline biases in online platforms: a study of diversity and homophily in Airbnb,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,Mar 29 2019,2019,"How diverse are sharing economy platforms? Are they fair marketplaces, where all participants operate on a level playing field, or are they large-scale online aggregators of offline human biases? Often portrayed as easy-to-access digital spaces whose participants receive equal opportunities, such platforms have recently come under fire due to reports of discriminatory behaviours among their users, and have been associated with gentrification phenomena that exacerbate preexisting inequalities along racial lines. In this paper, we focus on the Airbnb sharing economy platform, and analyse the diversity of its user base across five large cities. We find it to be predominantly young, female, and white. Notably, we find this to be true even in cities with a diverse racial composition. We then introduce a method based on the statistical analysis of networks to quantify behaviours of homophily, heterophily and avoidance between Airbnb hosts and guests. Depending on cities and property types, we do find signals of such behaviours relating both to race and gender. We use these findings to provide platform design recommendations, aimed at exposing and possibly reducing the biases we detect, in support of a more inclusive growth of sharing economy platforms.",
How the study of networks informs knowledge translation and implementation: a scoping review,IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE,Mar 27 2019,2019,"BackgroundTo date, implementation science has focused largely on identifying the individual and organizational barriers, processes, and outcomes of knowledge translation (KT) (including implementation efforts). Social network analysis (SNA) has the potential to augment our understanding of KT success by applying a network lens that examines the influence of relationships and social structures on research use and intervention acceptability by health professionals. The purpose of this review was to comprehensively map the ways in which SNA methodologies have been applied to the study of KT with respect to health professional networks.MethodsSystematic scoping review methodology involved searching five academic databases for primary research on KT that employed quantitative SNA methods, and inclusion screening using predetermined criteria. Data extraction included information on study aim, population, variables, network properties, theory use, and data collection methods. Descriptive statistics and chronology charting preceded theoretical analysis of findings.ResultsTwenty-seven retained articles describing 19 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies reported on 28 structural properties, with degree centrality, tie characteristics (e.g., homophily, reciprocity), and whole network density being most frequent. Eleven studies examined physician-only networks, 9 focused on interprofessional networks, and 1 reported on a nurse practitioner network. Diffusion of innovation, social contagion, and social influence theories were most commonly applied.ConclusionsEmerging interest in SNA for KT- and implementation-related research is evident. The included articles focused on individual level evidence-based decision-making: we recommend also applying SNA to meso- or macro-level KT activities. SNA research that expands the range of professions under study, examines network dynamics over time, extends the depth of analysis of the role of network structure on KT processes and outcomes, and employs mixed methods to triangulate findings, is needed to advance the field. SNA is a valuable approach for evaluating key network characteristics, structures and positions of relevance to KT, implementation, and evidence informed practice. Examining how network structure influences connections and the implications of those holding prominent network positions can provide insights to improve network-based KT processes.",
Individual-level social influence identification in social media: A learning-simulation coordinated method,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH,Mar 16 2019,2019,"This study develops a learning-simulation coordinated method to perform individual-level causal inference and social influence identification in social media. This method uses machine learning models to predict user adoption behavior, uses simulation to infer unobservable potential outcomes, and uses a counterfactual framework to identify individual-level social influence. The method also uses an adjusting strategy to reduce the effect of homophily and correlated unobservables. Empirical results obtained on a synthetic dataset and a semi-synthetic dataset show that the proposed method performs better on causal inference at the individual and aggregate levels than competitive methods. The computational experiment using a real-world database considers three applications, i.e., new product adoption, repeated purchase and cross selling. The empirical results show that the proposed method performs well on identifying influential members. The results reveal that the global hubs and local central nodes of the versatile friend circles have similar influences on the adoption behavior of the followers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Structural transition in social networks: The role of homophily,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Mar 13 2019,2019,"We introduce a model for the formation of social networks, which takes into account the homophily or the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others, and the mechanisms of global and local attachment as well as tie reinforcement due to social interactions between people. We generalize the weighted social network model such that the nodes or individuals have Ffeatures and each feature can have q different values. Here the tendency for the tie formation between two individuals due to the overlap in their features represents homophily. We find a phase transition as a function of F or q, resulting in a phase diagram. For fixed q and as a function of F the system shows two phases separated at F-c. For F < F-c large, homogeneous, and well separated communities can be identified within which the features match almost perfectly (segregated phase). When F becomes larger than Fc the nodes start to belong to several communities and within a community the features match only partially (overlapping phase). Several quantities reflect this transition, including the average degree, clustering coefficient, feature overlap, and the number of communities per node. We also make an attempt to interpret these results in terms of observations on social behavior of humans.",
Hidden patterns Using social network analysis to track career trajectories of women STEM faculty,EQUALITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION,Mar 11 2019,2019,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe how one group of ADVANCE Project researchers investigated faculty co-authorship networks to identify relationships between women's positions in these networks, their research productivity and their advancement at the university - and to make those relationships transparent.Design/methodology/approach Multiple methods for capturing faculty network data were evaluated, including collecting self-reported data and mining bibliometric data from various web-based sources. Faculty co-authorship networks were subsequently analyzed using several methodologies including social network analysis (SNA), network visualizations and the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator.Findings Results suggest that co-authorship provides an important way for faculty to signal the value of their work, meaning that co-authoring with many others may be beneficial to productivity and promotion. However, patterns of homophily indicate that male faculty tend to collaborate more with other men, reducing signaling opportunities for women. Visualizing these networks can assist faculty in finding and connecting with new collaborators and can provide administrators with unique views of the interactions within their organizations. Finally, Kaplan-Meier survival studies showed longitudinal differences in the retention and advancement of faculty based on gender.Originality/value Together, these findings begin to shed light on subtle differences that, over time, may account for the significant gender disparities at STEM institutions, patterns which should be investigated and addressed by administrators. Lessons learned, as well as the novel use of SNA and Kaplan-Meier in investigating gender differences in STEM faculty, provide important findings for other researchers seeking to conduct similar studies at their own institutions.",
"Demographic homophily, communication and trust in intra-organizational business relationships",JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING,Mar 4 2019,2019,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to understand how employees of an organization build and maintain successful business relationships by analyzing major antecedents of relationship quality and relationship commitment. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors develop a conceptual framework and formulate hypotheses regarding the relationships between demographic homophily, interpersonal communication, trust and dependent variables of perceived relationship quality and relationship commitment. This paper tests hypotheses presented in this study with the help of a structural equation model, based on a data sample from South Korea. Findings Unlike common thinking, demographic homophily does not directly increase the perceived relationship quality. The authors find a significant direct effect of interpersonal communication on relationship commitment but no effect of commitment on perceived relationship quality. Both seem to play independent roles but are positively influenced through the emergence of trust.Research limitations/implications - By applying demographic homophily and interpersonal communication as antecedents and trust as mediator and main driver, the authors research effects on perceived intra-organizational relationship commitment and perceived relationship quality. In detail, the authors confirm the hypothesized centrality of trust in intra-organizational relationships between demographic homophily, interpersonal communication and dependent variables of perceived relationship quality and relationship commitment. Nevertheless, the authors surprisingly find neither significant evidence that demographic homophily increases the perceived quality of a relationship, nor does it lead to higher communication intensity directly, even in an environment (i.e. Korea), where it would be expected.Practical implications - Based on the findings of this study, there are several practical implications. Understanding the interpersonal relationship characteristics in an intra-organizational setting enables managers to optimize organizational efficiency and effectiveness. Intra-organizational relationships between employees' are highly dependent on mutual trust as an indicator for relationship quality and relationship commitment. Organizations can also benefit from the understanding of the mechanisms of demographic homophily and interpersonal communication for the establishment of interpersonal trust as well.Originality/value - Research about the effect of demographic homophily and interpersonal communication and the central role of trust in an intraorganizational approach to business relationships on perceived relationship quality and relationship commitment is scarce. The mutual testing of the effects and interaction of established constructs like demographic homophily, interpersonal communication and trust on perceived relationship quality and commitment constitutes the main contribution of this study to the literature on management and business relationships. The insights of this study about interpersonal bonding help companies to establish long-term business relationships.",
Social influence in first-time and upgrade adoption,ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,MAR-APR 2019,2019,"The effects of social influence on product adoption have been documented for new products and first-time adoptions. Few investigated whether social influence plays an important role in upgrade adoption. Unlike first-time adoption, consumers have gained product experience, so their perceived risks and uncertainty were less than in first-time adoption. To study the roles that social influence plays in first-time versus upgrade adoption, we implemented two experiments. Study 1 involved a lab experiment on whether social influence works in upgrade adoption. Study 2 implemented a field study to identify the effects of peer adoption of virtual goods, with 897,765 participants: 28,730 first-time adopters and 15,056 upgraders. The results offer four findings. First, the results show that social influence affected consumer upgrade decisions. Second, there were different effects of social influence in upgrade adoption: informative influence decays and normative influence rises from first-time to upgrade adoption. Third, the influential adopters (and upgraders) vary across the stages. Well-connected adopters exerted stronger influence than less-connected ones in first-time adoption, and upgraders with higher homophily relative to non-upgraders exerted influence in upgrade adoption. Fourth, the susceptibility to influence of non-adopters (non-upgraders) also varied in the different stages. Less-connected non-adopters were more susceptible in their first-time adoption, while non-upgraders with higher reciprocity were more susceptible in their upgrade decision. These results extend our understanding of social influence, especially in different adoption contexts. This research also can help marketers identify influential adopters to facilitate online marketing campaigns.",
A Multi-agent System for Modelling Preference-Based Complex Influence Diffusion in Social Networks,COMPUTER JOURNAL,Mar 2019,2019,"Influence diffusion modelling, analysis and applications in the preference-aware context draw tremendous attention to both researchers and practitioners. Most contemporary studies typically model the influence-diffusion pheromone from a centralized perspective. In this paper, we model the bi-directional influence propagation in directed weighted networks in a distributed manner with the consideration of user preference by facilitating Agent-Based Modelling. In the proposed model, each individual's personalized features and the social context are modelled based on the underlying social theories, i.e. social influence and the homophily effect. In addition, the model is capable of not only producing a certain range of dynamical behaviours based on different parameter constellation but also analyzing the evolutionary trends of a social network and capturing the dynamics in the environment. Another attractive feature is the training capability of agents, which enables them to adapt the personalized features. Comparing with traditional approaches, the proposed model is more suitable for handling the complex nature of influence diffusion, and demonstrates the advantages in simulating the real-world influence diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a novel seeding algorithm for influence maximization, named Enhanced Evolution-Based Backward selection. The algorithm utilizes the advantages offered by the proposed agent-based model. The experimental results reveal that the algorithm is superior to those state-of-the-art algorithms for influence maximization.",
Beyond homophily: Incorporating actor variables in statistical network models,NETWORK SCIENCE,Mar 2019,2019,"We consider the specification of effects of numerical actor attributes, having an interval level of measurement, in statistical models for directed social networks. A fundamental mechanism is homophily or assortativity, where actors have a higher likelihood to be tied with others having similar values of the variable under study. But there are other mechanisms that may also play a role in how the attribute values of two actors influence the likelihood of a tie between them. We discuss three additional mechanisms: aspiration, the tendency to send more ties to others having high values; attachment conformity, sending more ties to others whose values are close to the ""social norm""; and sociability, where those having higher values will tend to send more ties generally. These mechanisms may operate jointly, and then their effects will be confounded. We present a specification representing these effects simultaneously by a four-parameter quadratic function of the values of sender and receiver. Flexibility can be increased by a five-parameter extension. We argue that for numerical actor attributes having important effects on directed networks, these specifications may provide an improvement. An illustration is given of dependence of advice ties on academic grades, analyzed by the Stochastic Actor-oriented Model.",
Some friends matter more than others: BMI clustering among adolescents in four European countries,NETWORK SCIENCE,Mar 2019,2019,"Previous research stresses the importance of social networks for obesity. We draw on friendship data from 18,133 adolescents in four European countries to investigate the relationship between individuals' body mass index (BMI) and the BMI of their friends. Our study reveals strong evidence for BMI clustering in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden; adolescents tend to be friends with others who have a similar BMI. Furthermore, we extend current debate and explore friendship characteristics that moderate the relationship between social networks and BMI. We demonstrate that BMI clustering is more pronounced in (1) strong compared to weak friendships and (2) between adolescents of the same biological sex. These findings indicate that more research on social networks and health is needed which distinguishes between different kinds of relationships.",
"Personality and cognitive skills in network of friends, for multi-ethnic schools",RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS,Mar 2019,2019,"In a multi ethnic society, friendship among children might be expected to be overwhelmingly shaped by ethnicity and cultural heritage. Using an original panel data-set of classmate networks in multi-ethnic primary schools near Florence, Italy, (N = 396 children in 2nd and 5th grade), we show instead that cognitive skills and personality traits matter as much as ethnicity in shaping friendships, thus playing the role of elective affinities. We test whether friends affect a child's personality more than the other way round: to do this, we estimate peer effects. We only find non-significant effect of peers on math grades and a measure of intelligence (KBIT). For personality traits, peer effects are significant only for Extraversion. These findings are crucial for design of immigration policies: rather than emphasizing differences among ethnic groups, a farsighted policy could try to point these elective affinities among individuals.

Finding College Student Social Networks by Mining the Records of Student ID Transactions,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Mar 1 2019,2019,"Information about college students' social networks plays a pivotal role in college students' mental health monitoring and student management. While there have been many studies to infer social networks by data mining, the mining of college students' social networks lacks consideration of homophily. College students' social behaviors show significant homophily in the aspect of major and grade. Consequently, the inferred inter-major and inter-grade social ties will be erroneously omitted without considering such an effect. In this work, we aimed to increase the fidelity of the extracted networks by alleviating the homophily effect. To achieve this goal, we propose a method that combines the sliding time-window method with the hierarchical encounter model based on association rules. Specifically, we first calculated the counts of spatial-temporal co-occurrences of each student pair. The co-occurrences were acquired by the sliding time-window method, which takes advantage of the symmetry of the social ties. We then applied the hierarchical encounter model based on association rules to extract social networks by layer. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive method to set co-occurrence thresholds. Results suggested that our model infers the social networks of students with better fidelity, with the proportion of extracted inter-major social ties in entire social ties increasing from 0.89% to 5.45% and the proportion of inter-grade social ties rising from 0.92% to 4.65%.",
MODELING WITHIN-HOUSEHOLD ASSOCIATIONS IN HOUSEHOLD PANEL STUDIES,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,Mar 2019,2019,"Household panel data provide valuable information about the extent of similarity in coresidents' attitudes and behaviours. However, existing analysis approaches do not allow for the complex association structures that arise due to changes in household composition over time. We propose a flexible marginal modeling approach where the changing correlation structure between individuals is modeled directly and the parameters estimated using second-order generalized estimating equations (GEE2). A key component of our correlation model specification is the ""superhousehold"", a form of social network in which pairs of observations from different individuals are connected (directly or indirectly) by coresidence. These superhouseholds partition observations into clusters with nonstandard and highly variable correlation structures. We thus conduct a simulation study to evaluate the accuracy and stability of GEE2 for these models. Our approach is then applied in an analysis of individuals' attitudes towards gender roles using British Household Panel Survey data. We find strong evidence of between-individual correlation before, during and after coresidence, with large differences among spouses, parent-child, other family, and unrelated pairs. Our results suggest that these dependencies are due to a combination of nonrandom sorting and causal effects of coresidence.",
Micro-Cultural Preferences and Macro-Percolation of New Ideas: A NetLogo Simulation,JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY,Mar 2019,2019,"This paper provides an extension of the Schelling agent-based model (ABM) of segregation which is augmented here with a mechanism for the percolation of new ideas. The main objective of the paper is to demonstrate that individual segregation preferences affect not only the intensity of aggregate segregation, but also the aggregate efficiency from crucial decision-making processes, such as the decision to invest in new ideas. To perform our research, we implement a NetLogo simulation in two steps by (i) obtaining three sets, each composed of 500 random segregation patterns, generated through a one-step simulation of a Schelling ABM for three different levels of segregation preference: namely, 20, 25 and 30%; and (ii) using the obtained level of segregation, we set the porosity level in a model for the percolation of new ideas and record the observed speed of percolation of new ideas for the first 100 steps. We find that levels of segregation due to 20 and 25% individual preference for homophily produce a difference of 3.4% in their effect on the speed of the percolation of new ideas. The levels of segregation of 25 and 30% individual preference for homophily, however, produce a difference of 12.8% in their effect on the percolation of new ideas. This means that the increase of the individual preference for segregation increases the intensity with which segregation acts as a barrier for new ideas to percolate successfully in the world of R&D investment. The segregation-percolation model used can be extended with further dynamics and developed as a code to be added to the NetLogo library. The main implication of our findings is that small changes in segregation preferences as in the Schelling ABM model produces increasingly negative on aggregate level spillover effects on other socio-economic processes, such as percolation of new ideas, which depend on the connectivity between people in the local society.",
Language skills and homophilous hiring discrimination: Evidence from gender and racially differentiated applications,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD,Mar 2019,2019,"This paper investigates the importance of ethnic homophily in the hiring discrimination process. Our evidence comes from a correspondence test performed in France in which we use three different kinds of ethnic identification: French sounding names, North African sounding names, and foreign sounding names with no clear ethnic association. Within the groups of men and women, we show that all non-French applicants are equally discriminated against when compared to French applicants. Moreover, we find direct evidence of ethnic homophily: recruiters with European names are more likely to call back French named applicants. These results show the importance of favoritism for in-group members. To test for the effect of information about applicant's skills, we also add a signal related to language ability in all resumes sent to half the job offers. The design allows to uniquely identify the effect of the language signal by gender. Although the signal inclusion significantly reduces the discrimination against non-French females, it is much weaker for male minorities.",
The use of Social Network Analysis in a study of intergroup relations between affirmative action and regular students in a public university,Estudos de Psicologia (Campinas),2019-03,2019,"Abstract Higher education has joined affirmative action and promoted the coexistence between different social groups at universities. This study evaluated the interaction pattern between 926 affirmative action and regular students from 25 different undergraduate programs from a public university using an informal social networks questionnaire. Homophily was the parameter chosen to measure intergroup relations. This behavior was evaluated according to the student’s term, yield rate (percentage of admitted students who enroll), field of knowledge and nature of relationship. The results showed a low degree of integration between groups in highly competitive undergraduate programs. The group of regular students showed a greater tendency for endogeneity. These results point to need to create a culture of inclusion that provides a distribution of resources between different social groups.",
"Let's Start From the Beginning: Examining the Connections Between Partner Selection, Trust, and Communicative Effectiveness in Voluntary Partnerships Among Human Services Nonprofits",COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,Mar 2019,2019,"The increasing popularity of interorganizational collaboration among human services nonprofits has generated significant interest and research from a variety of disciplines. However, the current literature has not sufficiently addressed the factors that shape trust and communication in human services nonprofit partnerships. As such, this study proposes that partner selection shapes trust and communication and, using data on 202 human services nonprofit partnerships in the state of Illinois, examines the relationship between partner selection factors and communication and trust in human services nonprofit partnerships. The results from the hierarchical regression analyses suggest that two partner selection factors, reputation and homophily, are significantly positively related to trust. Regarding the factors that shape communication, the results suggest that prior experience and trust are significantly positively related to communicative effectiveness.",
The Role of Status Differentials and Homophily in the Formation of Social Support Networks of a Voluntary Organization,COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,Mar 2019,2019,"Given the important implications of social support on managing volunteers and their organizational commitment, we investigated how members of a Korean immigrant church (N = 178) exchanged two distinctive kinds of social support (i.e., informational and tangible). We used theories of centrality and homophily to hypothesize patterns of social connections among organizational members. Employing exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), the current study estimated the likelihood of age and gender homophily/heterophily in forming supportive ties while considering structural parameters. The results of analysis of variance showed that members with higher socioeconomic status and in official staff positions in the church were more central in the informational support exchange. However, ERGM for both types of support networks did not show hypothesized gender and age homophily/heterophily of Korean immigrants' support exchange, suggesting the importance of other potential organizational and cultural influences. The findings shed light on the internal structuring of organizational support networks and suggest practical implications for managing organizational volunteers.",
Diversity in airline alliance portfolio configuration,JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT,Mar 2019,2019,"Alliances in the airline industry operate as a basic strategy to stimulate competition and both the number and the types of alliances have increased over time. Each airline maintains alliances simultaneously with a variable number of partners. The set of airline's alliance partners constitutes its alliance portfolio. A central theme of these portfolios is the way in which partner selection improve performance. Is the alliance portfolio configuration based on either similar or different partners? We examine how the differences can arise from differences between the partners themselves, from resource complementarity, and from the partners structural positions in the network. The relations between these types of differences and whether they affect firm performance are studied. Codeshare alliances established between airline companies at a global level are analyzed to establish their effects on performance. In particular, the study comprises 135 alliance portfolios all of which from major airlines. The results suggest that structural homogeneity and complementarity improve performance and that alliance portfolio diversity favors network resource complementarity.",
Social learning with differentiated products,RAND JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,Mar 2019,2019,"Learning from friends is a key process by which consumers acquire information about available products. This article embeds social learning in a model of firms producing differentiated products. I consider how the structure of social relationships between consumers influences pricing and welfare. In particular, how a variety of characteristics of social networks - distribution of friendships, homophily, clustering, and correlations between an individual's preferences and number of friends - influence these outcomes. I also find conditions under which consumer awareness and the sensitivity of demand to prices are useful measures of the informational efficiency of markets.",
"Shared contexts, shared background, shared values - Homophily in Finnish parliament members' social networks on Twitter",TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS,Mar 2019,2019,"While Twitter has become an essential part of daily politics across Western countries, little research has focused on origins of politicians' social circles on social media. This paper contributes to how structural, ideological and contextual factors affect tie formation between parliamentarians' Twitter networks. The study focuses on Finland, where over 80 percent of parliamentarians are using the platform. For empirical analysis, we first extracted parliamentarians' followee network connections from their Twitter accounts (36 294 nodes and 113 108 edges) and combined it with data from a national voting advice application, which includes information regarding parliamentarians' societal position and opinions regarding social, cultural and economic issues. According to the explanatory analysis, we found that connections between parliamentarians and the share of mutual followees are clearly based on matching values, similar background and shared contextual factors. Additionally, we found that shared context had strong confounding effects on the function of value homophily in relations and shared networks between Finnish parliamentarians.",
Review of Community Detection over Social Media: Graph Prospective,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS,Feb 2019,2019,"Community over the social media is the group of globally distributed end users having similar attitude towards a particular topic or product. Community detection algorithm is used to identify the social atoms that are more densely interconnected relatively to the rest over the social media platform. Recently researchers focused on group-based algorithm and member-based algorithm for community detection over social media. This paper presents comprehensive overview of community detection technique based on recent research and subsequently explores graphical prospective of social media mining and social theory (Balance theory, status theory, correlation theory) over community detection. Along with that this paper presents a comparative analysis of three different state of art community detection algorithm available on I-Graph package on python i.e. walk trap, edge betweenness and fast greedy over six different social media data set. That yield intersecting facts about the capabilities and deficiency of community analysis methods.",
Mathematical model of gender bias and homophily in professional hierarchies,CHAOS,Feb 2019,2019,"Women have become better represented in business, academia, and government over time, yet a dearth of women at the highest levels of leadership remains. Sociologists have attributed the leaky progression of women through professional hierarchies to various cultural and psychological factors, such as self-segregation and bias. Here, we present a minimal mathematical model that reveals the relative role that bias and homophily (self-seeking) may play in the ascension of women through professional hierarchies. Unlike previous models, our novel model predicts that gender parity is not inevitable, and deliberate intervention may be required to achieve gender balance in several fields. To validate the model, we analyze a new database of gender fractionation over time for 16 professional hierarchies. We quantify the degree of homophily and bias in each professional hierarchy, and we propose specific interventions to achieve gender parity more quickly.",

"The Space Between Us: On Shifting Sitting Patterns in Tel Aviv Taxi-Cabs, and Their Meanings",JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY,Feb 2019,2019,"The taxi is a widespread mode of public transportation. In this everyday-life urban setting total strangers, a driver and his fare, interact and co-operate. In Israel, taxi passengers must choose whether to sit in the front seat, near the stranger-driver, or in the backseat, behind him. This choice pre-structures the incoming interaction and sets its general tone. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in a taxi in Tel Aviv, as well as on interviews and street observations, this article examines shifting sitting patterns in Tel Aviv taxis. These shifting proxemic patterns reveal homophilous tendencies and reflect, in a nutshell, wider structural, socioeconomic, and ideological changes undergone by Israeli society.",
What connections lead to good scientific performance?,SCIENTOMETRICS,Feb 2019,2019,"This paper concentrates on the connections in the collaboration network and aims to explore what kinds of connections improve the joint output of the two nodes in connection, using the collaboration data of top institutions in the field of Information Science and Library Science for the period 2007-2016. More intensive connections are found between top institutions, and most institutions are connected into the largest component. The effect of international connection on performance is compared between US and non-US institutions. The homophily of centrality, tie strength and h-index measured as assortativity coefficient is described to show how institutions of similar properties tend to connect with each other in the graph. Furtherly, a negative binomial regression model is employed to investigate the relationship between the homogenous connections and the citation counts received by the connections. Characteristics of connections that contribute to good performance are then obtained.",
Will They Listen to Me? An Examination of In-Group Gender Bias in Children's Communication Beliefs,SEX ROLES,Feb 2019,2019,"We assessed developmental and gender differences in children's beliefs about their peers' communication styles. We hypothesized that children hold more favorable beliefs (i.e., more responsiveness and less interruption) about communicating with same-gender peers than with other-gender peers. We also explored whether these beliefs related to children's friendships and expectations that they will feel included or discomfort with their peers. Participants (n=311) were 159U.S. third-graders (M-age=7.13, SD=.49, 52% girls) and 152U.S. fifth-graders (M-age=9.08, SD=.71, 46% girls). Children showed in-group biases: They expected more positive responses when communicating with same-gender versus other-gender peers. These patterns were stronger in girls and younger children. Beliefs about interruption varied by gender: girls expected girls to interrupt less than boys, and boys thought boys and girls interrupt equally often. Finally, the more children believed that they would receive positive communication responsiveness, the more friends, the more inclusion, and the less discomfort they expected with same- and other-gender peers. The more they expected interruptions, the less included and more discomfort they reported. The results suggest that children's communication beliefs may perpetuate same-gender preferences; however, promoting mixed-gender interactions may help children cultivate beliefs and skills needed to function successfully in mixed-gender contexts.",
Partner-selection effects on venture capital investment performance with uncertainties,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,Feb 2019,2019,"This paper intends to complement the existing literature on the performance of venture capital (VC) investments by presenting a multiple principal-agent framework for examining partner selection strategies aimed at mitigating uncertainties and their effects on investment performance and boundary conditions. Using a dataset of VC investments from 1980 and 2008 in the U.S., we found evidence that the existence of industrial and geographic uncertainties negatively affects the performance of independent VC (IVC) investments. The empirical results show that the strategy of partner selection has no effect on WC performance. However, from the homophily and resource perspectives, if various VC-specific uncertainties are considered as contextual factors, one would expect CVC firms to be selected as partners by IVC firms as a way to increase the probability of success.",
"Examining the Effects of MTV's 16 and Pregnant on Adolescent Girls' Sexual Health: The Implications of Character Affinity, Pregnancy Risk Factors, and Health Literacy on Message Effectiveness",HEALTH COMMUNICATION,Jan 28 2019,2019,"Health communication strategies to decrease teen pregnancies include the employment of entertainment-education (E-E), which involves embedding health messages in an entertainment media vehicle that is relatable and attractive to the intended audience. MTV's 16 and Pregnant is an example of such an effort as an E-E documentary-style reality show that aimed to reduce the U.S. teen pregnancy rate. A pretest-posttest experiment was conducted with 147 adolescent girls (ages 14-18) to investigate the effectiveness of 16 and Pregnant on beliefs, attitudes, and intentions to avoid teen pregnancy. Among participants who reported the lowest levels of identification, parasocial relationship, and homophily, viewing 16 and Pregnant resulted in more negative attitudes toward teen pregnancy. Among participants who reported the highest level of homophily, viewing 16 and Pregnant resulted in more positive attitudes toward teen pregnancy. Levels of pregnancy risk and health literacy were examined but were not significant moderators. Results are discussed in light of E-E theory and research.",
Respondent-driven sampling and the homophily configuration graph,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,Jan 15 2019,2019,"Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a popular method for surveying hard-to-reach populations, especially in the public health domain. Adjusting for the complex sampling mechanism of the RDS procedure is challenging. We propose a new model for the RDS mechanism motivated by a graph model, which we call the Homophily Configuration Graph. Under this model, we develop a new estimator for population proportions that is robust to seed bias, differential activity, differential recruitment and short recruitment chains. We also connect it to existing RDS theory by showing that, if the sample fraction is small, our estimator limits to the popular Salganik-Heckathorn estimator. We perform simulation studies on both empirically observed networks and networks with known statistical properties, suggesting that this new estimator has less bias than currently recommended estimators.",
Underlying Dimensions of Social Cohesion in a Rural Community Affected by Wartime Violence in Colombia,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Jan 2 2019,2019,"War deteriorates the quality of life of the population and profoundly alters social dynamics. We discuss a rural community in northern Colombia whose population was the victim of a massacre and examine the main components that model social cohesion: (a) positive attitudes towards the community, (b) prosocial behaviours and (c) interpersonal relationships. This investigation is a cross-sectional empirical study that includes an analysis of social support networks. The research involved 106 residents, (81.1%, women), with an average age of 42.5 years (standard deviation (SD) = 16.4), who have lived in the community an average 28.8 years (SD = 18.75). Cluster analysis shows that there are two types of personal networks based on homophily and the duration of the ego-alter relationship. The networks that provide the most types of social support shows a moderate level of homophily according to the type of relationship and place of origin and in which the duration of the ego-alter relationship is shorter, compared to networks characterized by high homophily and in which the duration of the ego-alter relationship is longer ((2) = 5.609, p < 0.018). Homophily based on place of residence actively affects the sense of community and social cohesion. Moreover, the sense of community is the variable that most affects social cohesion ( = 0.650; p < 0.001) and is, in turn, determined by prosocial behaviour ( = 0.267; p < 0.006). However, prosocial behaviours do not significantly affect interpersonal relationships or community cohesion. The results are discussed to promote social development strategies aimed at building individual, organizational and community capacity to foster psychosocial well-being in post-war contexts.",
The Role of Cognitive Abilities in Assortative Mating: Partner Preferences of Young Adults,SOCIOLOGICKY CASOPIS-CZECH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,2019,2019,"This article focuses on the relationship between young adults' cognitive abilities and individual partner preferences. We worked with the Preference NSZ 2017 data set, which contains data on partner preferences and the results of the National Comparative Secondary-School Exams of Czech high school graduates, and our analyses, using logistic regression, confirmed a tendency towards homophily on the level of cognitive abilities and university education. Young people with above-average results place more importance on agreement in political opinions, but do not regard the partner's homemaking abilities or financial situation as too important. The results further show that partner preferences differ according to the education capital of the background family and according to preferred partnership arrangement. We also find significant differences in the partner preferences of men and women that reflect ideas about traditional gender roles. Women favour characteristics that relate to status, and men assign more importance to physical looks.",
A Study on Positive Effects of Personal Game Broadcasting: Focusing on Game Efficacy,Journal of Digital Convergence,2019,2019,The purpose of this study is to verify empirically the effects of BJ worship and perceived homophily on game efficacy through mediating effect of loyalty to viewing. 485 participants who had watched personal game broadcasting were collected as a sample through an online survey and the collected data were analyzed through structural equation modeling. The research model assuming full mediating effect and the alternative model assuming partial mediating effect were compared and bootstrapping was performed to analyze direct and indirect effects between variables. The results showed BJ worship and perceived homophily had significant effects on game efficacy through the full mediated effect of loyalty to viewing. The noteworthy contribution of this study is to verify how viewing personal game broadcasting has a significant impact on the formation of game efficacy and then ultimately provide positive perception of BJ.,
#Islamexit: inter-group antagonism on Twitter,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,2019,2019,"While analyses of Twitter have shown that it holds democratic potential, it can also provide a venue for hate speech against minorities. The articulation of opinion-based identities, the tendency to homophily, and the use of emotional discourses can indeed help spread verbal violence on Twitter. This paper discusses group polarization on Twitter through Mouffe's distinction of agonistic and antagonistic politics, as elaborated in the 2013 book Agonistic: Thinking the World Politically. The theory is supported by a practical example: a qualitative analysis of Islamophobic tweets sent in the aftermath of the 2016 British referendum on European Union membership, which is commonly referred to as Brexit'. Following the UK's decision to leave the EU, there was a surge of Islamophobic attacks on Twitter. My analysis reveals that anti-Islamic sentiments were articulated in terms of complex identities referring not only to religion but also to ethnicity, politics, and gender. The paper shows that these tweets are antagonistic in character because they prevent the dialogic participation of Muslims and propagate symbolic violence rather than engaging in constructive conflicts.",

Second-Order Markov Assumption Based Bayes Classifier for Networked Data With Heterophily,IEEE ACCESS,2019,2019,"The classification of networked data is an interesting and challenging problem. Most traditional relational classifiers that are based on the principle of homophily have an unsatisfactory classification performance in networks with heterophily. This is because these methods treat inhomogeneous networks homogeneously. A progression of a network-only Bayes-classifier-based second-order Markov assumption is proposed for heterophilous networks in this paper to address this problem. First, we estimate the class distribution of an unlabeled node according to the class distribution of its neighbors' neighbors. In this process, we perform this computation on the known and unknown neighbors separately. Second, we combine the two parts using multinomial na i ve Bayesian classification. Meanwhile, we pair a relaxation labeling collective inference method (which imports simulated annealing) with this new method to update the class distributions at each iteration. Comparisons of the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better when the networks are heterophilous.",
"RECIPROCITY IN BOOK REVIEWING AMONG AMERICAN, BRITISH AND CANADIAN ACADEMICS",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-CAHIERS CANADIENS DE SOCIOLOGIE,2019,2019,"Books and their reviews have been historically central to knowledge dissemination in the social sciences and humanities. Despite this perceive importance, few studies have assessed the relative importance of these document types in the dissemination of knowledge. This paper aims at better understanding the place of book reviews in the scholarly communication system and to shed light-through the analysis of books on Canada, United Kingdom and United States and their reviewers--on the international circulation of ideas in the social sciences and humanities. Based on 1,675,999 book reviews indexed in the Social Science Citation Index and Arts and Humanities Citation Index over the 1975-2016 period, our results show that book reviews arc decreasing in importance in all disciplines-especially those where books have historically been peripheral. We also observe a high rate of homophily between reviewers and reviewed books, with researchers being primarily interested in the books that have been written by someone from their own country. Hence, despite the now widely held assumptions of the globalization of science, social science and humanities remains a highly localized activity.",
Individual and Network Factors Associated With Racial Disparities in HIV Among Young Men Who Have Sex With Men: Results From the RADAR Cohort Study.,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),2019-Jan-01,2019,"BACKGROUND: Individual sexual risk behaviors have failed to explain the observed racial disparity in HIV acquisition. To increase understanding of potential drivers in disparities, we assessed differences across individual, network, and social determinants.METHODS: Data come from RADAR (N = 1015), a longitudinal cohort study of multilevel HIV-risk factors among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) aged 16-29 years in Chicago, IL. Data collection includes biological specimens; network data, including detailed information about social, sexual, and drug-use networks; and psychosocial characteristics of YMSM.RESULTS: Compared to white YMSM (24.8%) and Hispanic YMSM (30.0%), black YMSM (33.9%) had a higher prevalence of both HIV (32%; P < 0.001) and rectal sexually transmitted infections (26.5%; P = 0.011) with no observed differences in pre-exposure prophylaxis use. Black YMSM reported lower rates of sexual risk behaviors and more lifetime HIV tests (P < 0.001) compared with all other YMSM; however, they were also significantly less likely to achieve viral suppression (P = 0.01). Black YMSM reported the highest rate of cannabis use (P = 0.03) as well as greater levels of stigma (P < 0.001), victimization (P = 0.04), trauma (P < 0.001), and childhood sexual abuse (P < 0.001). White YMSM reported higher rates of depression (P < 0.001) and alcohol use (P < 0.001). In network analyses, significant differences existed across network characteristics with black YMSM having the lowest transitivity (P = 0.002), the highest density (P < 0.001), and the highest homophily (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Black YMSM do not report higher rates of HIV-risk behaviors, but social and network determinants are aligned toward increased HIV risk. These results suggest that network interventions and those addressing social determinants may help reduce disparities.",
Celebrity-Fan Engagement on Instagram and Its Influence on The Perception of Hijab Culture Among Muslim Women in Malaysia,JURNAL KOMUNIKASI-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,2019,2019,"Celebrities who use Instagram can influence their female followers in many ways, for instance, in influencing their perceptions on body image, adoption of healthy eating lifestyles, and persuading them to purchase products or services endorsed by these celebrities. Accordingly, this study aims to examine the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on Instagram on hijab culture among Muslim women in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among female university students from the International Islamic University of Malaysia (N = 630). In order to participate in the study, respondents completed an online survey and are instructed to think about a favourite female Muslim celebrity they follow on Instagram while completing the research instrument. Results indicate that almost one-third of the most popular Muslim celebrities among females Instagram users are non-traditional celebrities (i.e. bloggers/vloggers, YouTube personalities and social media influencers). Furthermore, attitude homophily and parasocial interaction with said celebrity may significantly influence the likelihood that the celebrity's profile will be visited, and the number of likes on their photos. Finally, after controlling for the respondents' religious educational background, this study found that those who had positive attitude and behaviour towards the hijab, and perceived a higher degree of parasocial bond with Muslim celebrities on Instagram tended to have a more positive perception towards the hijab culture. The repercussions of these findings on the parasocial interaction theory, and the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on social media over hijab culture are discussed.",
Exploring Political Journalism Homophily on Twitter: A Comparative Analysis of US and UK Elections in 2016 and 2017,MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION,2019,2019,"The tendency of political journalists to form insular groups or packs, chasing the same angles and quoting the same sources, is a well-documented issue in journalism studies and has long been criticized for its role in groupthink and homogenous news coverage. This groupthink attracted renewed criticism after the unexpected victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election as the campaign coverage had indicated a likely win by the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. This pattern was repeated in the 2017 UK election when the Conservative party lost their majority after a campaign in which the news coverage had pointed to an overall Tory victory. Such groupthink is often attributed to homophily, the tendency of individuals to interact with those most like them, and while homophily in the legacy media system is well-studied, there is little research around homophily in the hybrid media system, even as social media platforms like Twitter facilitate the development-and analysis-of virtual political journalism packs. This study, which compares Twitter interactions among US and UK political reporters in the 2016 and 2017 national elections, shows that political journalists are overwhelmingly more likely to use Twitter to interact with other journalists, particularly political journalists, and that their offline tendencies to form homogenous networks have transferred online. There are some exceptions around factors such as gender, news organizations and types of news organization-and important distinctions between types of interactions-but overall the study provides evidence of sustained homophily as journalists continue to normalize Twitter.",
Team Assembly Mechanisms and the Knowledge Produced in the Mexico's National Institute of Geriatrics: A Network Analysis and Agent-Based Modeling Approach,SCIENTIFICA,2019,2019,"Mexico's National Institute of Geriatrics (INGER) is the national research center of reference for matters related to human aging. INGER scientists perform basic, clinical, and demographic research which may imply different scientific cultures working together in the same specialized institution. In this paper, by a combination of text mining, coauthorship network analysis, and agent-based modeling, we analyzed and modeled the team assembly practices and the structure of the knowledge produced by scientists from INGER. Our results showed a weak connection between basic and clinical research and the emergence of a highly connected academic leadership. Importantly, basic and clinical-demographic researchers exhibited different team assembly strategies: basic researchers tended to form larger teams mainly with external collaborators, while clinical and demographic researchers formed smaller teams that very often incorporated internal (INGER) collaborators. We showed how these two different ways to form research teams impacted the organization of knowledge produced at INGER. Following these observations, we modeled, via agent-based modeling, the coexistence of different scientific cultures (basic and clinical research) exhibiting different team assembly strategies in the same institution. Three virtual experiments were run in our agent-based model. The three experiments kept similar values to the collaborating dynamics of INGER in terms of average team size and probabilities of choosing incumbents and external collaborators. The only difference among these experiments was the value of homophily defined as the trend to collaborate with research studies from the same field (14% corresponding to the 46% and 79%). The main result of these experiments is that by modulating just one variable (homophily), we could successfully reproduce the current situation of INGER (homophily of 79%) and simulate alternative scenarios in which interdisciplinary (46%) and transdisciplinary (14%) research could be done.",
Exploring journalists' interactions with each other on Twitter,DIGITAL JOURNALISM,2019,2019,"Journalists have for considerable time been criticized for living in their own bubbles, a phenomenon industry commentators have referred to as groupthink, while in scholarship the tendency of individuals to connect with people who are like them is termed homophily. This age-old process has come under scrutiny in recent times due to the arrival of social network sites, which have been viewed as both working against but also leading to more homophily. In journalism scholarship, these processes are still little understood, however. Focusing on the social network site Twitter and drawing on a large-scale analysis of more than 600,000 tweets sent by 2908 Australian journalists during one year, this study shows that journalists continue to live in bubbles in their online interactions with each other. Most journalists were more likely to interact with journalists who have the same gender, work in the same organization, on the same beat or in the same location. However, the study also demonstrates some notable exceptions as well as the importance of differentiating between types of interaction.",
A Parallel Community Detection in Multi-Modal Social Network With Apache Spark,IEEE ACCESS,2019,2019,"A constrained latent space model (CLSM) infers community membership based on two modalities in multi-modal social network data: network topology and node attributes. In this paper, we extend our previous model, CLSM in two ways. First, we introduce the Spark implementation of CLSM for parallel computation by fitting the inference algorithm into the map-reduce framework. Second, we consider user reputation besides the network homophily, which also affects social interactions between users. We test CLSM and its extension on two real-world problems: understanding link and user attributes in the location-based social network, and a review-trust network. Our proposed models in Spark can be easily deployed on commercial cloud services, such as Google cloud or Amazon web service and find latent community membership in large-scale datasets. We perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets and show how CLSM extension improves our previous model. We also share meaningful insights we discovered with the datasets.",
Social dynamics modeling of chrono-nutrition,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,Jan 2019,2019,"Gut microbiota and human relationships are strictly connected to each other. What we eat reflects our body-mind connection and synchronizes with people around us. However, how this impacts on gut microbiota and, conversely, how gut bacteria influence our dietary behaviors has not been explored yet. To quantify the complex dynamics of this interplay between gut and human behaviors we explore the ""gut-human behavior axis"" and its evolutionary dynamics in a real-world scenario represented by the social multiplex network. We consider a dual type of similarity, homophily and gut similarity, other than psychological and unconscious biases. We analyze the dynamics of social and gut microbial communities, quantifying the impact of human behaviors on diets and gut microbial composition and, backwards, through a control mechanism. Meal timing mechanisms and ""chrono-nutrition"" play a crucial role in feeding behaviors, along with the quality and quantity of food intake. Considering a population of shift workers, we explore the dynamic interplay between their eating behaviors and gut microbiota, modeling the social dynamics of chrono-nutrition in a multiplex network. Our findings allow us to quantify the relation between human behaviors and gut microbiota through the methodological introduction of gut metabolic modeling and statistical estimators, able to capture their dynamic interplay. Moreover, we find that the timing of gut microbial communities is slower than social interactions and shift-working, and the impact of shift-working on the dynamics of chrono-nutrition is a fluctuation of strategies with a major propensity for defection (e.g. high-fat meals). A deeper understanding of the relation between gut microbiota and the dietary behavioral patterns, by embedding also the related social aspects, allows improving the overall knowledge about metabolic models and their implications for human health, opening the possibility to design promising social therapeutic dietary interventions.",
A Novel Social Recommendation Method Fusing User's Social Status and Homophily Based on Matrix Factorization Techniques,IEEE ACCESS,2019,2019,"As one of the most successful recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering provides a useful recommendation by associating an active user with a crowd of users who share the same interests. Although some achievements have been achieved both in theory and practice, the efficiency of recommender systems has been negatively affected by the problems of cold start and data sparsity recently. To solve the above problems, the trust relationship among users is employed into recommender systems to build a learning model to further promote the prediction quality and users' satisfaction. However, most of the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms fail to take into account the fact that users with different levels of trust and backgrounds, that is, user's social status and homophily have different degrees of influence on their friends. In this paper, a novel social matrix factorization-based recommendation method is proposed to improve the recommendation quality by fusing user's social status and homophily. User's social status and homophily play important roles in improving the performance of recommender systems. We first build a user's trust relationship network based on user social relationships and the rating information. Then, the degree of trust is calculated through the trust propagation method and the PageRank algorithm. Finally, the trust relationship is integrated into the matrix factorization model to accurately predict unknown ratings. The proposed method is evaluated using real-life datasets including the Epinions and Douban datasets. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the existing social networks-based recommendation algorithms.",
Modeling location-based social network data with area attraction and neighborhood competition,DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY,Jan 2019,2019,"Modeling user check-in behavior helps us gain useful insights about venues as well as the users visiting them. These insights are important in urban planning and recommender system applications. Since check-in behavior is the result of multiple factors, this paper focuses on studying two venue related factors, namely, area attraction and neighborhood competition. The former refers to the ability of a spatial area covering multiple venues to collectively attract check-ins from users, while the latter represents the extent to which a venue can compete with other venues in the same area for check-ins. We first embark on empirical studies to ascertain the two factors using three datasets gathered from users and venues of three major cities, Singapore, Jakarta and New York City. We then propose the visitation by area attractiveness and neighborhood competition (VAN) model incorporating area attraction and neighborhood competition factors. Our VAN model is also extended to incorporate social homophily so as to further enhance its modeling power. We evaluate VAN model using real world datasets against various state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that VAN model outperforms the baselines in check-in prediction task and its performance is robust under different parameter settings.",
"A New Era of HIV Risk: It's Not What You Know, It's Who You Know (and How Infectious)","ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY, VOL 70",2019,2019,"HIV is transmitted in social and sexual relationships, and HIV transmission risks, as well as protective actions, are evolving as HIV epidemics unfold. The current focus of HIV prevention is centered on antiretroviral medications used to reduce HIV infectiousness in persons already infected with HIV [treatment as prevention (TasP)]. The same medications used to treat infected persons can also be used by uninfected persons as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the infectivity of HIV. Both PrEP and TasP are effective when adherence is high and individuals do not have co-occurring sexually transmitted infections. HIVprevention is most effective and efficient when delivered within sexual networks with high HIV prevalence. Specific network characteristics are recognized as important facilitators of HIV transmission; these characteristics include the degree of similarity among network members (homophily), gender role norms, and belief systems. Since 2011, HIV risk has been redefined based on infectiousness and infectivity, ushering in a new era of HIV prevention with the potential to end HIV epidemics.",
An Investigation of Racial and Ethnic Homophily on Grindr Among an Ongoing Cohort Study of YMSM,AIDS AND BEHAVIOR,Jan 2019,2019,"Men who have sex with men (MSM), and especially MSM of color, are disproportionately affected by HIV. Previous research shows that MSM have high levels of racial/ethnic homophily (the tendency for people to have sex with others who share the same racial/ethnic identification) in sexual dyads, which may help explain HIV disparities. This study fills a gap in previous research by grounding network data from a cohort study of young MSM in Chicago (RADAR) in the contexts of virtual spaces (VSs) and examining differences in levels of racial/ethnic homophily using multilevel-logistic-regression models. Results show that Grindr differs from other VSs in proportions of racially/ethnically homophilous dyads and by partner racial/ethnic identification. After controlling for general homophily trends, sex partnerships formed on Grindr by Black MSM were significantly less likely to be homophilous than those of White MSM. While racial/ethnic groups differ in likelihood to form homophilous partnerships, this trend varies by VS.",
Integrating Social Homophily and Network Lasso for Personalized Sentiment Classification,IEEE ACCESS,2019,2019,"People often have different opinions toward the same topic, posing challenges for traditional sentiment analysis systems that rely on statistical models estimated with population-level data. Personalization is a solution to the problem, but it suffers from data scarcity issue, as the labeled date for a specific user is usually only available in a small quantity. In this paper, we exploit the theory of social homophily to overcome this difficulty by assuming that social neighbors are likely to express similar opinions with respect to the same topic or document. We present a personalized sentiment analysis system that leverages the social relation information to balance between personalization and overfitting. Our approach is based on network lasso that automatically clusters socially proximate users together, so that users in the same group share the same personalized model. We develop a distributed optimization algorithm that makes our system scale to large networks as well. The experiments on Yelp review datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms competitive methods.",
"Our Buddies, Ourselves: The Role of Sexual Homophily in Adolescent Friendship Networks",CHILD DEVELOPMENT,JAN-FEB 2019,2019,"The present study tests the assumption that peers wield sufficient influence to induce sexual homophily (i.e., similarities in sexual experiences). Because girls face greater stigma for their sexual experiences than do boys, sexual homophily may be greater in girls' friendship networks than in boys'. Stochastic actor-based models were used to analyze network data (n = 2,566; ages 14-18) from two high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Sexual homophily was present in friendship networks. Girls and boys were equally susceptible to their friends' influence, but the former exhibited a stronger preference for befriending same sexual debut status peers than the latter. The findings suggest that adolescents-particularly girls-""curate"" their networks to minimize peer ostracism.",
Homophily in delinquent behavior: The rise and fall of friend similarity across adolescence,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT,Jan 2019,2019,"This study examined age-related changes in friend similarity on delinquency to determine whether deviant behavior homophily peaks during mid-adolescence. A community sample of 1,663 male and 1,826 female Swedish youth from Grade 5 (M = 11.21 years) to Grade 10 (M = 16.25 years) provided self-reports of delinquency. Friendships were identified from nominations. Intraclass correlations revealed age group differences in friend delinquency similarity, independent of normative age-related changes in deviant behavior. Cross-sectional results indicated that similarity was greatest in the seventh grade (M = 13.21 years). Longitudinal results from a subsample of participants revealed an increase in friend similarity from ages 11 to 13 (Grades 5 to 7) and a decline in friend similarity from ages 14 to 16 (Grades 8 to 10). The findings demonstrate that similarity between friends in delinquent behavior peaks in mid-adolescence, independent of normative age-related changes in participation in deviant acts.",
Space and personal contacts: Cross-group interaction between mainland and local university students in Hong Kong,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,Jan 2019,2019,"Despite sharing physical space that supports contact with out-group members and institutional arrangements that encourage cross-group interaction, many university students still congregate within their own groups. To explain this phenomenon, this study examines the micro-level social processes that prevent or facilitate intergroup interaction. A qualitative study of Mainland Chinese and local university students in Hong Kong reveals that students lack opportunities for mutually engaging experiences across multiple points in time due to fragmented daily living space, defended interpersonal space, and politicized online space, which contribute to the absence of cross-group interactions. Cross-group friendships depend on external forces to remove inhibitions, which then allow emotional bonding. This study contributes to the understanding of cross-group interaction by pointing out the importance of daily routine activities and mutually engaging experiences in influencing cross-group interaction among students.",
Intergenerational friendships of older adults: why do we know so little about them?,AGEING & SOCIETY,Jan 2019,2019,"Intergenerational projects bringing together older adults and younger adults are increasingly common, but there is little research on unstructured, naturally occurring interaction, and in particular friendship between different generations. The aim of this article is to interrogate why we know so little about adult intergenerational friendship. A systematic literature search on this topic, covering a 30-year period, yielded only six articles which satisfied the inclusion criteria. This prompted us to examine how the topics of intergenerational friendship and friendship in old age have been approached in the literature to date. We argue that the paucity of research on intergenerational friendship reflects the focus of existing research on homophily, and consequently friendships among older or younger adults; and that this in turn reflects a social construction of older adults as unsuited to friendship with younger adults. Investigations of intergenerational friendship can help challenge the images and models of ageing and older adults that both research and societies currently operate with, and are constrained by. We conclude by calling for research that explores the views and experiences of older adults as parties to intergenerational relationships that are non-kin, chosen and based on mutual enjoyment.",
Ordinary Political Conversation in Seemingly Nonpolitical Leisure: All Talk and No Action?,LEISURE SCIENCES,Dec 27 2018,2018,"This article focuses on the potential of leisure to encourage political cross-talk among everyday citizens, exposing its discussants to different political perspectives. Though our literature has long championed leisure for its public sphere effects, little research has examined its actual impact. To generate interest in this line of inquiry, I discuss the value of everyday cross-talk for democratic citizenship and consider the role leisure possibly plays in its advancement. Evidence is reported from the few studies outside of our field that focus on casual political talk in seemingly nonpolitical environments and activities. Finally, potential reactions to political talk in leisure contexts and the outcome(s) of such talk are explored. The article ends with questions posed to offer guidance for future research.",
Persistence of false paradigms in low-power sciences,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Dec 26 2018,2018,"We develop a model describing how false paradigms may persist, hindering scientific progress. The model features two paradigms, one describing reality better than the other. Tenured scientists display homophily: They favor tenure candidates who adhere to their paradigm. As in statistics, power is the probability (absent any bias) of denying tenure to scientists adhering to the false paradigm. The model shows that because of homophily, when power is low, the false paradigm may prevail. Then, only an increase in power can ignite convergence to the true paradigm. Historical case studies suggest that low power comes either from lack of empirical evidence or from reluctance to base tenure decisions on available evidence.",
An empirical investigation of network polarization,APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION,Dec 15 2018,2018,"This paper proposes and explores a new quantitative characterization of the polarization phenomenon in networks. New tools for evaluating the polarization of a network are presented. We first characterize the homophily of each node individually. We depart from the definition of a new measure of the homophily of the nodes of a network and we consider the homophily distribution over the nodes as a primary indicator of the strength of polarization. Next, to address the polarization of the network as a whole, a probabilistic approach is developed. The approach is based on the straightforward computation of empirical cumulative distribution functions of sampled data from the network. These empirical distributions provide a more insightful understanding of the status of the network. They may be used not only to compare the polarization of groups of nodes or entire networks, but also to estimate the impacts of external interventions in terms of node polarization. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated on several case studies associated with real-life data sets from different sources. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
The preeminence of ethnic diversity in scientific collaboration,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Dec 4 2018,2018,"Inspired by the social and economic benefits of diversity, we analyze over 9 million papers and 6 million scientists to study the relationship between research impact and five classes of diversity: ethnicity, discipline, gender, affiliation, and academic age. Using randomized baseline models, we establish the presence of homophily in ethnicity, gender and affiliation. We then study the effect of diversity on scientific impact, as reflected in citations. Remarkably, of the classes considered, ethnic diversity had the strongest correlation with scientific impact. To further isolate the effects of ethnic diversity, we used randomized baseline models and again found a clear link between diversity and impact. To further support these findings, we use coarsened exact matching to compare the scientific impact of ethnically diverse papers and scientists with closely-matched control groups. Here, we find that ethnic diversity resulted in an impact gain of 10.63% for papers, and 47.67% for scientists.",
Discovering Homophily in Online Social Networks,MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS,Dec 2018,2018,"During the last ten years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have increased their popularity by becoming part of the real life of users. Despite their tremendous widespread, OSNs have introduced several privacy issues as a consequence of the nature of the information involved in these services. Indeed, the huge amount of private information produced by users of current OSNs expose the users to a number of risks. The analysis of the users' similarity in OSNs is attracting the attention of researchers because of its implications on privacy and social marketing. In particular, the homophily between users could be used to reveal important characteristics that users would like to keep hidden, hence violating the privacy of OSNs' users. Homophily has been well studied in existing sociology literature, however, it is not easily extensible in OSNs due to the lack of real datasets. In this paper, we propose an analysis of similarity of social profiles in terms of movie preferences. Results reveal the presence of homophily between users and its dependence from the tie strength. Moreover, we show that it is possible to profile a user (in our case by considering the age attribute) by exploiting movie preferences.",
Learning from Your Friends' Check-Ins: An Empirical Study of Location-Based Social Networks,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Dec 2018,2018,"Recently, mobile applications have offered users the option to share their location information with friends. Using data from a major location-based social networking application in China, we estimate an empirical model of restaurant discovery and observational learning. The unique feature of repeat customer visits in the data allows us to examine observational learning in trials and repeats and to separate it from non-informational confounding mechanisms, such as homophily, using a novel test based on the empirical model. The empirical evidence supports a strong observational learning effect. We also find that the moderating role of the geographical locations of users and their friends on the magnitude of observational learning is critical. These findings suggest a nuanced view for local merchants to boost observational learning with the advancement of location-based technology.",
Who Talks Religion and What Are the Consequences for Social Ties? Unpacking a Sensitive Discussion Topic in Close Networks,SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION,WIN 2018,2018,"Though religion matters greatly to many U.S. adults, it is widely considered a touchy conversational topic. Understanding how religious issues are talked about with others can elucidate a key interpersonal manifestation of Americans' faith, yet existing research has largely overlooked the phenomena of religious discussion in social networks. This article considers which types of people talk about religion with their close ties, what relational factors underlie religious discussion, and what implications such discussion has for network turnover and stability. Applying multilevel regression methods to ego-centered networks measured in the Portraits of American Life Survey, I find that individual-and relational-level factors each predict the presence of religious discussion within close networks. Longitudinal analyses further reveal that for a large subset of Americans-namely evangelical and mainline Protestants and those involved in a congregation-religious discussion partners are especially likely to remain in the network over the course of 6 years. This association extended beyond other factors that could explain tie persistence, including relational closeness and multiple forms of homophily. Results point to several promising future directions for the study of religion and social networks.",
Tour guides' communication ecosystems: an inferential social network analysis approach,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & TOURISM,Dec 2018,2018,"Successful performance by tour guides depends highly on their networking activities and interpersonal skills. Membership in related associations can provide opportunities for establishing and expanding a supportive network in the tour guiding profession. This study explores communication ecosystems used among the members of the largest professional tour guides organization, the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations (WFTGA). Using the data collected from the 17th WFTGA convention in Tehran, Iran, we investigated five types of tour guides' communications ecosystems (i.e. in-person, online-call, text-message, e-mail, and social networks) and compared them to tour guides' networks of colleagues (i.e., the network that shows how people know one another and how they are linked). Moreover, we included the complementary no-contact network to enhance the internal validity of the study. Using exponential random graph modeling, all seven networks have been modeled using demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, marital status, and tenure along with the history of participation in previous WFTGA conventions and WFTGA membership status. The analyses of virtual/digital (i.e., online-call, text-message, e-mail, and online social networks) and natural/traditional (i.e., in-person) communication ecosystems showed interesting similarities and differences among the seven networks, providing valuable insights for practitioners as well as academicians. Findings revealed the formation of networks based on homophily as well as heterophily effects is a function of types of communication ecosystem.",
The Relationship of Organisational Value Frames with the Configuration of Alliance Portfolios: Cases from Electricity Utilities in Great Britain,SUSTAINABILITY,Dec 2018,2018,"Increasing concerns over global and local sustainability issues motivate businesses to develop solutions via collaborative partnerships. While many studies explain the contributions of sustainable alliances to economic, environmental, and social sustainability, less is known about how a portfolio of these alliances is configured. This study aims to answer this question by examining the relationship between organisational value frames and alliance portfolio configurations of 16 utility companies in the electricity industry of Great Britain. The study finds that organisational value frames play a key role in the selection of alliance partners and hence the configuration of alliance portfolios. The results demonstrate that British electricity utilities often collaborate with cognitively similar organisations. The results demonstrate that cognitive homophily is common in selecting partners to tackle sustainability issues. While previous studies demonstrated homophily in partner selection as resource homophily or status homophily, in the sustainability context, this study shows that homophily is also about values that guide interpretations of sustainability issues.",
Exploring How Homophily and Accessibility Can Facilitate Polarization in Social Networks,INFORMATION,Dec 2018,2018,"Polarization in online social networks has gathered a significant amount of attention in the research community and in the public sphere due to stark disagreements with millions of participants on topics surrounding politics, climate, the economy and other areas where an agreement is required. This work investigates into greater depth a type of model that can produce ideological segregation as a result of polarization depending on the strength of homophily and the ability of users to access similar minded individuals. Whether increased access can induce larger amounts of societal separation is important to investigate, and this work sheds further insight into the phenomenon. Center to the hypothesis of homophilic alignments in friendship generation is that of a discussion group or community. These are modeled and the investigation into their effect on the dynamics of polarization is presented. The social implications demonstrate that initial phases of an ideological exchange can result in increased polarization, although a consensus in the long run is expected and that the separation between groups is amplified when groups are constructed with ideological homophilic preferences.",
"Social ties, homophily and heterophily in urban sustainability transitions: User practices and solar water heater diffusion in China",ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE,Dec 2018,2018,"This paper aims to explore the potential of latecomer cities in sustainability transitions from the demand side. The case study investigates the role of users and their social ties in influencing the popularisation of solar water heaters in a latecomer city Dezhou, in contrast to a more developed counterpart, Beijing. The two cities show vast differences in user preferences towards the low-tech environmental innovation, and the stronger social ties in Dezhou facilitate the diffusion through not only frequent social learning and peer pressure, but also enhancing user-producer trust and relation. These findings suggest that latecomer cities could provide less harsh selection environments for disruptive environmental innovations and their comparatively homogenous social ties could be harnessed to empower niche development.",
Consumer perceptions of information helpfulness and determinants of purchase intention in online consumer reviews of services,INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT,Dec 2018,2018,"Online consumer reviews offer an unprecedented amount of information for consumers to evaluate services before purchase. We use the dual process theory to investigate consumer perceptions about information helpfulness (IH) in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) contexts. Results highlight that popularity signals, two-sided reviews, and expert sources (but not source trustworthiness) are perceived as helpful by consumers to assess service quality and performance. Although two-sided reviews exercise a significant influence on perceived IH, their influence on purchase intention was indirectly mediated by IH. IH predicts purchase intention and partially mediates the relationship between popularity signals, source homophily, source expertise, and purchase intention.",
Attributed Social Network Embedding,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING,Dec 1 2018,2018,"Embedding network data into a low-dimensional vector space has shown promising performance for many real-world applications, such as node classification and entity retrieval. However, most existing methods focused only on leveraging network structure. For social networks, besides the network structure, there also exists rich information about social actors, such as user profiles of friendship networks and textual content of citation networks. These rich attribute information of social actors reveal the homophily effect, exerting huge impacts on the formation of social networks. In this paper, we explore the rich evidence source of attributes in social networks to improve network embedding. We propose a generic Attributed Social Network Embedding framework (ASNE), which learns representations for social actors (i.e., nodes) by preserving both the structural proximity and attribute proximity. While the structural proximity captures the global network structure, the attribute proximity accounts for the homophily effect. To justify our proposal, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art network embedding approaches, ASNE can learn more informative representations, achieving substantial gains on the tasks of link prediction and node classification. Specifically, ASNE significantly outperforms node2vec with an 8.2 percent relative improvement on the link prediction task, and a 12.7 percent gain on the node classification task.",
"Toy Story: Homophily, Transmission and the Use of Simple Simulation Models for Assessing Variability in the Archaeological Record",JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY,Dec 2018,2018,"The interpretation of spatial and temporal patterns in the archaeological record remains a long-standing issue in the discipline. Amongst many methods and interpretations, modelling of biased transmission' has proved a successful strategy to tackle this problem. Here, we investigate a type of biased transmission, homophily, that is the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. In contrast to other social sciences, homophily remains underused in archaeology. In order to fill this gap, we develop six distinct variants of a well-established modelling framework borrowed from social science, Axelrod's Cultural Dissemination Model. These so-called toy models are abstract models used for theory-building and aim at exploring the interplay between homophily and various factors (e.g. addition of spatial features such as mountains and coastlines, diffusion of innovations and population spread). The relevance and implications of each toy model' for archaeological reasoning are then discussed.",
Negotiating sameness and difference in geographies of older age,AREA,Dec 2018,2018,"To advance understanding of the geographies of age segregation, this paper examines the intersectional social dynamics of age-segregated environments, considering how migration interacts with age segregation to breed sameness or diversity in ageing environments. We juxtapose findings drawn from two research projects, the first on international retirement migration in Spain, where older people inhabit certain geographical and social spaces with ""people like them"" sharing similar identity characteristics and preferences. The second project was in older people's centres in South London, more diverse sites where people are brought together on the basis of need rather than choice. In interrogating the different social dynamics operating in these age-segregated environments, we reflect on the implications of ""choice homophily"" for ageing experiences. We recognise the potential of differentiated spaces for ageing, but also question how homophilic choices in retirement can create self-selected and socially segregated retirement environments that reproduce divisions of ""race"" ethnicity and social class, which would undoubtedly be seen as problematic in other spheres of the life course.",
A unified framework for link prediction based on non-negative matrix factorization with coupling multivariate information,PLOS ONE,Nov 29 2018,2018,"Many link prediction methods have been developed to infer unobserved links or predict missing links based on the observed network structure that is always incomplete and subject to interfering noise. Thus, the performance of existing methods is usually limited in that their computation depends only on input graph structures, and they do not consider external information. The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structure and node attribute information should help to resolve the task of link prediction. This work proposes SASNMF, a link prediction unified framework based on non-negative matrix factorization that considers not only graph structure but also the internal and external auxiliary information, which refers to both the node attributes and the structural latent feature information extracted from the network. Furthermore, three different combinations of internal and external information are proposed and input into the framework to solve the link prediction problem. Extensive experimental results on thirteen real networks, five node attribute networks and eight non-attribute networks show that the proposed framework has competitive performance compared with benchmark methods and state-of-the-art methods, indicating the superiority of the presented algorithm.",
Approximation and hardness results for the Max k-Uncut problem,THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE,Nov 21 2018,2018,"In the study of the homophily law of large scale complex networks, we get a combinatorial optimization problem which we call the Max k-Uncut problem. Given an n-vertex undirected graph G = (V, E) with nonnegative weights {we vertical bar e is an element of E} defined on edges, and a positive integer k, the Max k-Uncut problem asks to find a partition (V-1, V-2, ..., V-k} of V such that the total weight of edges that are not cut is maximized. Intuitively, an edge that is not cut connects two vertices with the same or similar attributes since they are in the same part of the partition. Interestingly, the Max k-Uncut problem is just the complement of the classic Min k-Cut problem. For Max k-Uncut, we present a randomized (1 - k/n)(2)-approximation algorithm, a greedy (1 - 2(k - 1/n) approximation algorithm, and an Omega(1/2 alpha)-approximation algorithm by reducing it to Densest k-Subgraph, where alpha is the approximation ratio of the Densest k-Subgraph problem. More importantly, we show that Max k-Uncut and Densest k-Subgraph are in fact equivalent in approximability up to a factor of 2. We also prove an approximation hardness result for Max k-Uncut under the assumption P not equal NP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Community detection using coordination games,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,Nov 8 2018,2018,"Communities typically capture homophily as people of the same community share many common features. This paper is motivated by the problem of community detection in social networks, as it can help improve our understanding of the network topology and the spread of information. Given the selfish nature of humans to align with like-minded people, we employ game-theoretic models and algorithms to detect communities in this paper. Specifically, we employ coordination games to represent interactions between individuals in a social network. We represent the problem of community detection as a graph coordination game. We provide a novel and scalable two-phased probabilistic semi-supervised approach to compute an accurate overlapping community structure in the given network. We evaluate our algorithm against the best existing methods for community detection and show that our algorithm improves significantly on benchmark networks (real and synthetic) with respect to standard normalized mutual information measure.",
Identity Override: How Sexual Orientation Reduces the Rigidity of Racial Boundaries,SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Nov 7 2018,2018,"Although most Americans have limited interpersonal relations with different-race others, interracial ties are notably more common among gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) individuals. Departing from the modal explanation of intergroup relations theories, which suggests that individual propensities for between-group interactions are driven by demographic groups' physical location relative to one another, we show that, beyond propinquity, GLB interraciality is spiked through active identification as GLB. We evaluate full romantic/sexual partnership histories along with friendship network racial compositions for respondents in a large, nationally representative sample. We show that GLBs have a greater likelihood and frequency than heterosexuals of forming multiple types of interracial ties and also that this effect applies only to those who actively identify as GLB and not to those who engage in same-sex relations but do not identify as GLB. This discovery refines theories of intergroup relations, isolating how identification serves as a mediating mechanism that can heighten the propensity for intergroup interaction. We argue that active identification with a group that crosses racial boundaries spurs overriding the rigidity of intergroup borders that otherwise dissuade interpersonal diversity.",
Meeting in the Middle: The Role of Mutual Biracial Friends in Cross-Race Friendships.,Child development,2018-Nov-05,2018,"Social network analysis was used to examine the role of having a mutual biracial friend on cross-race friendship nominations among monoracial sixth-grade students (Mage =10.56years) in two racially diverse middle schools (n=385; n=351). Monoracial youth were most likely to choose same-race peers as friends but more likely to choose biracial than different-race peers as friends, suggesting that racial homophily may operate in an incremental way to influence friendships. Monoracial different-race youth were also more likely to be friends if they had a mutual biracial friend. The findings shed light on the unique role that biracial youth play in diverse friendship networks. Implications for including biracial youth in studies of cross-race friendship are discussed.",
"Randomized Trial Evaluating Targeted Photographic Health Communication Messages in Three Stigmatized Populations: Physically-Disabled, Senior, and Overweight/Obese Individuals",JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION,Nov 2 2018,2018,"The homophily principle that perceived similarities among people produce positive reactions is a cross-cultural, global phenomenon. The prediction that photographs depicting models similar to the target population improve health communication was tested. Three nationally-representative samples (n = 1,796) of adults who are disabled, seniors, or considered overweight/obese were selected from GfK's Knowledge Panel (R). Participants read a message promoting physical activity and improved diets and responded to assessments of behavioral intentions, outcome and self-efficacy expectations, and identification. Photographs from a stock photograph service versus photographs created for the research project to match the three populations, Real Health Photos (RHP), were included in the message. Structural equation modeling confirmed that RHP which matched the population increased behavioral intentions mediated by identification (p < 0.05) in the physically-disabled and overweight/obese samples. Messages with only half of the matched RHP images had these same positive indirect effects (p < 0.05). Matched visual images in health messages improved effectiveness by capitalizing on the homophily and identification processes. Health educators should leverage these hardwired, evolutionary, biological phenomena that extend to health status as well as race and ethnicity. For optimal effects, not all persons shown need to be homophilous to the target audience, reducing logistical difficulties in showing diverse persons of various types.",
"Cooperative Learning in Middle School: A Means to Improve Peer Relations and Reduce Victimization, Bullying, and Related Outcomes",JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2018,2018,"Peer victimization is a highly stressful experience that impacts up to a third of all adolescents and can contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, including elevated anxiety, depression, drug use, and delinquency, as well as reduced self-esteem, school attendance, and academic achievement. Current prevention approaches (e.g., the Olweus program) have a mixed record in American schools. We propose a new approach to prevention that leverages theory and research surrounding the social aspects of bullying and victimization, particularly peer relations. Our approach attempts to (a) break down the process of homophily among bullies and (b) provide a mechanism by which socially isolated students can develop new friendships. Our approach asks teachers to increase opportunities for positive peer interaction through carefully structured, group-based learning activities in school (i.e., cooperative learning). We hypothesized that these positive peer interactions would result in reductions in bullying, victimization, perceived stress, and emotional problems, as well as increases in peer relatedness, among more marginalized students. Using a cluster randomized trial with 15 rural middle schools in the Pacific Northwest (N = 1,460 7th-grade students), we found that cooperative learning significantly reduced bullying, victimization, and perceived stress for marginalized students (i.e., moderated effects) and reduced emotional problems and enhanced relatedness for all students (i.e., main effects). Given that cooperative learning has already been shown to enhance student engagement and achievement in prior research, our results demonstrate that cooperative learning should be a permanent, sustainable component of teacher training and school culture.Educational Impact and Implications StatementOur findings indicate that cooperative learning can address many of the social problems in middle school that can give rise to bullying and victimization. Due to its established ability to enhance academic achievement, cooperative learning can be seen as a low-risk, high-reward approach to prevention that should enhance, rather than detract from, academic outcomes. Considering its straightforward implementation and flexibility, we hope that our results contribute to increased interest in cooperative learning as a means to support positive academic, social, and behavioral outcomes simultaneously.",
What is the role of sense of community in multiracial societies? A contribution to the community-diversity dialectic: A genetic psychology approach,JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2018,2018,"Interconnecting the construct of sense of community (SOC), elaborated by McMillan and Chavis, with the notion of social representations, elaborated by Moscovici, this article aims to contribute to advancing an understanding of the relationship between SOC and respect for diversity. Utilizing a genetic psychology approach and the intergroup contact theory, the article articulates 3 levels through which the social representation of community and SOC can be formed and transformed (i.e., microgenetic, ontogenetic, and sociogenetic) to enhance the investigation of the relationship between the 2 phenomena beyond the intraindividual and interindividual levels that tend to emphasize homophily, or preference for similarity. In particular, the article elaborates on the sociogenetic formation of SOC by examining the macro-level forces that participate in establishing what a community should be and who is entitled to be part of it. Examples from 2 previous studies are discussed.",
US College Students' Social Network Characteristics and Perceived Social Exclusion: A Comparison Between Drinkers and Nondrinkers Based on Past-Month Alcohol Use,JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS,Nov 2018,2018,"Objective: There is a general perception on college campuses that alcohol use is normative. However, nondrinking students account for 40% of the U.S. college population. With much of the literature focusing on intervening among drinkers, there has been less of a focus on understanding the nondrinker college experience. The current study has two aims: to describe the social network differences between nondrinkers and drinkers in a college setting, and to assess perceived social exclusion among nondrinkers. Method: First-year U.S. college students (n = 1,342; 55.3% female; 47.7% non-Hispanic White) were participants in a larger study examining a social network of one college class and network associations with alcohol use. Alcohol use, sociocentric and egocentric network ties were assessed, as were experiences of social exclusion related to nondrinking. Results: Drinking homophily based on past-month use was found; students tended to associate with others with a similar drinking status. Compared with drinkers, nondrinkers received fewer network nominations within the first-year network and made more nominations outside the first-year network. Nondrinkers' perceived social exclusion was positively related to the number of drinkers in their social networks, such that those with more drinkers in their network reported more social exclusion. Conclusions: College students' past-month drinking status in the first semester of college is related to their network position and perception of social exclusion. Nondrinking students who are part of a nondrinking community are less likely to feel socially excluded. Improving our understanding of the nondrinker college experience should improve support services for these students.",
Fashion and Homophily,OPERATIONS RESEARCH,NOV-DEC 2018,2018,"We analyze the evolution of fashion based on a network game model. Each agent in this model is a conformist or a rebel. A conformist prefers to take the action most common among her neighboring agents, whereas a rebel prefers the opposite. When there is only one type of agents, the model possesses an exact potential function, implying that fashion cycles are unlikely to emerge in a homogeneous population. The homophily index, a measure of segregation in networks with multiple types of nodes, is shown to play a key role in the emergence of fashion cycles. Our main finding is that a lower homophily index, in general, promotes the emergence of fashion cycles. We establish this result through a potential analysis, a partial potential analysis, and a stability analysis of a system of ordinary differential equations that is approximated from a stochastic best response dynamic. Numerical simulations based on a variety of networks confirm that the approximate analysis is reliable.",
Coupling diversity across human behavior spaces,EPL,Nov 2018,2018,"The heterogeneous nature of human behaviors contributes to the complexity of human-activated systems. Empirical observations and theoretical models reveal the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of many aspects of human behaviors, including social connections and geographic movements, while little is known whether and how human individual's behavioral diversities are correlated across different aspects. With statistical analysis on large-scale data of aligned online and offline human behaviors, we show that behavior spaces are coupled, independent from the specific choice of measurements. The coupling further expands to individual's direct and indirect social contacts. This finding provides insight into understanding homophily in different social systems and further improving the predictability of human online and offline behaviors. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2018",
Online Social Networks (OSN) Evolution Model Based on Homophily and Preferential Attachment,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Nov 2018,2018,"In this paper, we propose a new scale-free social networks (SNs) evolution model that is based on homophily combined with preferential attachments. Our model enables the SN researchers to generate SN synthetic data for the evaluation of multi-facet SN models that are dependent on users' attributes and similarities. Homophily is one of the key factors for interactive relationship formation in SN. The synthetic graph generated by our model is scale-invariant and has symmetric relationships. The model is dynamic and sustainable to changes in input parameters, such as number of nodes and nodes' attributes, by conserving its structural properties. Simulation and evaluation of models for large-scale SN applications need large datasets. One way to get SN data is to generate synthetic data by using SN evolution models. Various SN evolution models are proposed to approximate the real-life SN graphs in previous research. These models are based on SN structural properties such as preferential attachment. The data generated by these models is suitable to evaluate SN models that are structure dependent but not suitable to evaluate models which depend on the SN users' attributes and similarities. In our proposed model, users' attributes and similarities are utilized to synthesize SN graphs. We evaluated the resultant synthetic graph by analyzing its structural properties. In addition, we validated our model by comparing its measures with the publicly available real-life SN datasets and previous SN evolution models. Simulation results show our resultant graph to be a close representation of real-life SN graphs with users' attributes.",
"Neighborhood formation in St. Louis, 1930",ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE,Nov 2018,2018,"What are the social bases of neighborhood formation in urban areas, and at what spatial scale are they most distinct from other neighborhoods? We address these questions in the case of St. Louis, Missouri, in 1930, where we can take advantage of unique geocoded census microdata on the whole population of the city that identifies who, with what background characteristics, lived where. Our analyses show that homophily by race and ethnicity was by far the strongest factor linking characteristics of persons to the composition of their neighbors. Measures of social class also were quite important, while the person's nativity and family status were statistically significant but minor predictors. Yet while this hierarchy of social factors held for the population as a whole, their relative importance varied greatly across racial/ethnic groups. Similarity in social class to neighbors was most important for native whites, nativity counted as much or more than class for recently arriving immigrant groups including Russians, Italians, and Poles, and race/ethnicity was by far the key predictor for these groups and blacks. We also found that these patterns of homophily were clearest at the scale of individual street segment and first-order combinations of segments. They were similar but less distinct at a larger spatial scale.",
Depressive Symptomology as a Moderator of Friend Selection and Influence on Substance Use Involvement: Estimates from Grades 6 to 12 in Six Longitudinal School-Based Social Networks,JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE,Nov 2018,2018,"Although the contributions of friend selection and friend influence to adolescent homophily on substance use behaviors has been of enduring research interest, moderators of these processes have received relatively little research attention. Identification of factors that dampen or amplify selection and influence on substance use behaviors is important for informing prevention efforts. Whereas prior research has examined adolescent drinking, smoking, and marijuana use, the current study examined whether friend selection and friend influence operated on substance use involvement, an indicator of problematic use, and whether depressive symptomology moderated these processes. In addition, it examined whether these relationships varied from grade 6 to 12. The study used a cohort-sequential design in which three cohorts of youth (first surveyed in grades, 6, 7, and 8) in six school-based longitudinal social networks were surveyed up to seven times, yielding N=6817 adolescents (49% female). Stochastic actor-oriented models were applied to test hypothesized relationships in the six networks, then results were synthesized in a meta-analysis. Depressive symptoms did not moderate selection or influence on substance use involvement at any grade level, but indirectly contributed to diffusion of substance use involvement through school networks via patterns of network ties. Research is needed on contextual factors, particularly in schools, that might account for when, if at all, depressive symptoms condition friend selection and influence on substance use.",
What do managers look for in candidates for international assignments?,THUNDERBIRD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW,NOV-DEC 2018,2018,"Globalization of business highlights the need for individuals with the right skills and experiences for international assignments. Gender, age, ethnicity, family situation, professional qualifications, past international experiences, as well as psychological characteristics can be counted among the selection criteria of a candidate for such assignments. This current study examines the role of assignment context and selecting manager characteristics in the selection process. First, these candidate characteristics are considered together with features of the assignment such as duration, destination, and task performed to examine if their consistency are critical. Second, whether managers draw from their own past and consider their own family situation and international experiences, or select a candidate with same gender, age, or ethnicity is investigated. The findings suggest that without matching manager characteristics and assignment features, candidate characteristics are of little importance.",
Factors of Engagement and Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Stage IV Breast Cancer Facebook Group.,Health communication,2018-Oct-23,2018,"This study examines the factors of online engagement, and the relationship between online engagement and health expectations in a Stage IV breast cancer Facebook group. Members of the Facebook group completed a survey that assessed tie strength, homophily, and health expectations. A content analysis measured optimal social support, and Facebook analytics measured engagement. The results show optimal social support and tie strength are positively related to engagement. However, only optimal social support explains variance in engagement independent of tie strength and homophily. Additionally, the more engaged members are, the more positive their health expectations. The results emphasize the value of optimal social support and engagement in online support groups for individuals with Stage IV breast cancer.",
The Competition of Homophily and Popularity in Growing and Evolving Social Networks,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Oct 18 2018,2018,"Previous studies have used several models to investigate the mechanisms for growing and evolving real social networks. These models have been widely used to simulate large networks in many applications. In this paper, based on the evolutionary mechanisms of homophily and popularity, we propose a new generation model for growing and evolving social networks, namely, the Homophily-Popularity model. In this new model, new links are added, and old links are deleted based on the link probabilities between every node pair. The results of our simulation-based experimental studies provide evidence that the proposed model is capable of modelling a variety of real social networks.",
Hunter-Gatherers Maintain Assortativity in Cooperation despite High Levels of Residential Change and Mixing,CURRENT BIOLOGY,Oct 8 2018,2018,"Widespread cooperation is a defining feature of human societies from hunter-gatherer bands to nation states [1, 2], but explaining its evolution remains a challenge. Although positive assortment of cooperators is recognized as a basic requirement for the evolution of cooperation, the mechanisms governing assortment are debated. Moreover, the social structure of modern hunter-gatherers, characterized by high mobility, residential mixing, and low genetic relatedness [3], undermines assortment and adds to the puzzle of how cooperation evolved. Here, we analyze four years of data (2010, 2013, 2014, 2016) tracking residence and levels of cooperation elicited from a public goods game in Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. Data were collected from 56 camps, comprising 383 unique individuals, 137 of whom we have data for two or more years. Despite significant residential mixing, we observe a robust pattern of assortment that is necessary for cooperation to evolve; in every year, Hadza camps exhibit high between-camp and low within-camp variation in cooperation. We find little evidence that cooperative behavior within individuals is stable over time or that similarity in cooperation between dyads predicts their future cohabitation. Both sets of findings are inconsistent with models that assume stable cooperative and selfish types, including partner choice models. Consistent with social norms, culture, and reciprocity theories, the strongest predictor of an individual's level of cooperation is the mean cooperation of their current campmates. These findings underscore the adaptive nature of human cooperation-particularly its responsiveness to social contexts-as a feature that is important in generating the assortment necessary for cooperation to evolve.",
Same-Sex Employees and Supervisors: The Effect of Homophily and Group Composition on Wage Differences,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE,Oct 2018,2018,"This article analyzes wage differences according to whether or not employees and their supervisors are of the same sex. The mechanism of homophily predicts that having supervisors of the same sex has a positive effect on wages. Additionally, we introduce four conflicting theories that consider group composition as a moderating factor. The hypotheses are tested with data from the Bavarian Graduate Panel via fixed-effect panel regressions. Results show that relative group sizes must be considered in order to see wage differences. These wage benefits emerge in minority and majority groups for male academics, but women earn less in majority groups when their supervisor is of the same sex.",
Homophily of music listening in online social networks of China,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2018,2018,"Homophily, ranging from demographics to sentiments, breeds connections in social networks, either offline or online. However, with the prosperous growth of music streaming services, whether homophily exists in online music listening remains unclear. In this study, two online social networks of the same group of active users who listened to complete songs over 1000 times and posted over 100 tweets are established, separately, in Netease Music and Weibo. Through presented multiple similarity measures, it is evidently demonstrated that homophily does exist in music listening for both online social networks. The unexpected listening similarity in Weibo also implies that knowledge from generic social networks can be confidently transferred to domain-oriented networks for context enrichment and algorithm enhancement. Comprehensive factors that might function in the formation of homophily are further probed, and many interesting patterns are profoundly revealed. It is found that female friends are more homogeneous in music listening and that positive and energetic songs significantly pull users close. Our methodology and findings shed light on realistic applications in online music services.",
Understanding health decision making: An exploration of homophily,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Oct 2018,2018,"The phenomenon of homophily first was described in Lazarsfeld and Merton's classic 1954 friendship analysis as a tendency for friendships to form between those who are alike in some respect. Although theories of decision making address a host of factors that affect the process, the influence of individuals with homophilic ties remains unaccounted for and unexplained. The purpose of this paper is to review theories relevant to decision making and describe what is known about the relationship between homophily and health care decision making. Further, we provide new evidence suggesting the influence of homophily on decision making in results from a randomized, multi-center clinical trial of American men with localized prostate cancer. A diverse sample of 293 men with a new diagnosis of localized prostate cancer reported relevant personal factors influencing the care management decision before randomization to a decision aid or usual care, between 2013 and 2015. Among these personal factors were the level of influence or importance ascribed to various individuals at the time of the treatment decision. One month later, participants reported how prepared they were for decision making. 123 men (42%) reported friends and/or coworkers as information sources, of which 65 (53%) indicated that friends and/or coworkers influenced the care decision. Men who reported friends/coworkers as information sources had significantly higher one-month preparation scores. Our review of decision making theories and practical applicability suggests the influence of homophilic relationships manifests in health care decision making. Faced with a list of options to manage health conditions, decision makers turn to known individuals in their environments, particularly those individuals with whom the decision maker can identify. Clinicians may solicit information from patients about influential others and explain how that support fits into the health decision at hand without dishonoring the importance of the homophilic relationship.",
Connected but segregated: social networks in rural villages,JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS,Oct 2018,2018,"There is an increased appreciation for, and utilization of, social networks to disseminate various kinds of interventions in a target population. Homophily, the tendency of people to establish relations with those they perceive to be most like themselves, can create within-group cohesion but at the same time can also lead to societal segregation. In public health, social segregation can form barriers to the spread of health interventions from one group to another. We analysed the structure of social networks in 75 villages in Karnataka, India, both at the level of individuals and network communities. We found all villages to be strongly segregated at the community level, especially along the lines of caste and sex, whereas other socioeconomic variables, such as age and education, were only weakly associated with these groups in the network. While the studied networks are densely connected, our results indicate that the villages are highly segregated.",
Online ethnic segregation in a post-conflict setting,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,Oct 2018,2018,"Existing research has shown that online networks are often segregated along identity lines, such as political ideology or religious views. Although online segregation should be specifically detrimental when appearing between ethnic groups in a post-conflict setting, to date we have no systematic evidence on the level of online ethnic segregation. To close this gap, the present study examines online ethnic segregation in a large ethnically mixed blogger network in a post-conflict society, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since politics has been found to enhance ethnic divides in the offline world, we additionally examine whether segregation is higher for bloggers engaging with political topics. Using large-scale web scraping, automated text analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, we find evidence for pronounced ethnic divisions. Furthermore, we find that political bloggers tend to have more ethnically segregated networks. The findings show that a broad public exchange transcending ethnic categories remains limited in the online context we study, and that those who dominate the online political debate tend to be those who in their social interactions put even more weight on ethnic categories than the average.",
The Home as a Political Fortress: Family Agreement in an Era of Polarization,JOURNAL OF POLITICS,Oct 2018,2018,"The manifestations of party polarization in America are well known: legislative gridlock, harsh elite rhetoric, and at the level of the electorate, increasing hostility across the partisan divide. We investigate the ramifications of polarization for processes of family socialization. Using the classic 1965 Youth-Parent Political Socialization Panel data as a baseline, we employ original national surveys of spouses and offspring conducted in 2015 supplemented by the 2014 and 2016 TargetSmart national voter files to demonstrate that political correspondence between married couples and parent-offspring agreement have both increased substantially in the polarized era. We further demonstrate that the principal reason for increased spousal correspondence is mate selection based on politics. Spousal agreement, in turn, creates an echo chamber that facilitates intergenerational continuity. Overall, our results suggest a vicious cycle by which socialization exacerbates party polarization.",
Patterns of co-membership: Techniques for identifying subgraph composition,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2018,2018,"Different social processes give rise to network structures with distinctive properties. In this paper our goal is to identify the social processes that give rise to distinct network structures (specifically, subgroups). We examine particular structural meta-relations by identifying the properties of individuals associated with specific subgroups. Clues to the process of group formation and the context in which these groups form and persist may be extracted from the properties of individuals in those groups. Following this intuition, we propose a general technique for identifying systematic patterns of attribute occupancy to determine how individual attributes may drive group formation. To connect the social context in which groups form to their structural signatures, we relate subgroup composition to nodal attributes. We illustrate the utility of comparing subgroup (e.g., clique, n-clique, k-core, etc.) co-membership with nodal co-membership in a variety of attributes. The correlations between these two co-membership matrices illustrate clearly the strength of association between shared attributes and shared subgraph membership. Furthermore, examining these correlations across groups of different sizes indicates where these attributes are most strongly associated with group co-membership. Additionally, these correlations fit well into a QAP framework to determine where shared subgraph membership has a stronger (or weaker) relation to shared attribute membership than we would expect by chance.

Homophily and prestige: An assessment of their relative strength to explain link formation in the online climate change debate,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2018,2018,"Previous work has shown that hyperlinks reflect actors' strategic choices; these dyadic relationships depend on the actors' exogenous attributes (e.g., homophily) and the network's endogenous features (e.g., prestige distribution among actors). We combine these factors as explanatory variables in different exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to assess the relative strength of prestige and homophily for the actors' link formation. We analyze the climate change discourse in a hyperlink network formed by US civil society actors from November 2014 and test how relevant the different factors are, including variables such as actor type, country, position, and topic. We find that both prestige and various aspects of homophily influence link formation online. With regard to the importance of the different factors, positional homophily stands out, followed by prestige and other homophily effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
An Examination of Leader-Member Dyadic Politeness of Exchange and Servant Leadership on Group Member Performance,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION,Oct 2018,2018,"Integrating conversational constraint theory and models of homophily and relational dyadic communication, this study investigates how leader-member politeness exchange and servant leadership influence group member performance in a Malaysian organizational context. Using hierarchical linear modeling with data obtained from a sample of 510 employees, 65 workgroups, and 3 organizations, a politeness of exchange-servant leadership model was tested. Results show that servant leadership was positively and significantly associated with workgroup manager's ratings of group member's performance. The positive association between servant leadership and group member performance is more pronounced when managers and members in workgroups are high in politeness of exchange in their interactions. As predicted, leader-member dyadic politeness of exchange within the workgroup manager-group member dyads moderated this positive association.",
Are the different layers of a social network conveying the same information?,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,Sep 15 2018,2018,"Comprehensive and quantitative investigations of social theories and phenomena increasingly benefit from the vast breadth of data describing human social relations that is now available within the realm of computational social science. Such data are, however, typically proxies for one of the many interaction layers composing social networks, which can be defined in many ways and are composed of communication of various types (e.g., phone calls, face-to-face communication, etc.). As a result, many studies focus on one single layer, corresponding to the data at hand. Several studies have however shown that these layers are not interchangeable, despite the presence of a certain level of correlation between them. Here, we investigate whether different layers of interactions among individuals lead to similar conclusions with respect to the presence of homophily patterns in a population-homophily represents one of the widest studied phenomenon in social networks. To this aim, we consider a data set describing interactions and links of various nature in a population of Asian students with diverse nationalities, first language and gender. We study homophily patterns, as well as their temporal evolution in each layer of the social network. To facilitate our analysis, we put forward a general method to assess whether the homophily patterns observed in one layer inform us about patterns in another layer. For instance, our study reveals that three network layers-cell phone communications, questionnaires about friendship, and trust relations-lead to similar and consistent results despite some minor discrepancies. The homophily patterns of the co-presence network layer, however, does not yield any meaningful information about other network layers.",
Shifting echo chambers in US climate policy networks,PLOS ONE,Sep 14 2018,2018,"Although substantial attention has focused on efforts by the new Administration to block environmental policies, climate politics have been contentious in the US since well before the election of Donald Trump. In this paper, we extend previous work on empirical examinations of echo chambers in US climate politics using new data collected on the federal climate policy network in summer 2016. We test for the similarity and differences at two points in time in homophily and echo chambers using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) to compare new findings from 2016 to previous work on data from 2010. We show that echo chambers continue to play a significant role in the network of information exchange among policy elites working on the issue of climate change. In contrast to previous findings where echo chambers centered on a binding international commitment to emission reductions, we find that the pre-existing echo chambers have almost completely disappeared and new structures have formed around one of the main components of the Obama Administration's national climate policy: the Clean Power Plan. These results provide empirical evidence that science communication and policymaking at the elite level shift in relation to the policy instruments under consideration.",
Using sentiment analysis to define twitter political users' classes and their homophily during the 2016 American presidential election,JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS,Sep 3 2018,2018,"This paper proposes an analysis of political homophily among Twitter users during the 2016 American Presidential Election. We collected 4.9 million tweets of 18,450 users and their contact network from August 2016 to November 2016. We defined six user classes regarding their sentiment towards Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: whatever, Trump supporter, Hillary supporter, positive, neutral, and negative. Next, we analyzed their political homophily in three scenarios. Firstly, we analyzed the Twitter follow, mention and retweet connections either unidirectional and reciprocal. In the second scenario, we analyzed multiplex connections, and in the third one, we analyzed friendships with similar speeches. Our results showed that negative users, users supporting Trump, and users supporting Hillary had homophily in all analyzed scenarios. We also found out that the homophily level increase when there are reciprocal connections, similar speeches, or multiplex connections.",
An empirical study on selectiviey of retweeting behaviors under multiple exposures in social networks,JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE,Sep 2018,2018,"Retweeting is an important behavior in social networks. A user might be exposed to a message multiple times by different followees before retweeting it. Selecting a followee as the predecessor of this message has a direct impact on the formation of retweeting relationships. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on Sina Weibo to understand the selectivity of retweeting behaviors. We find that social influence is more important than homophily in a user's selection decision. We then propose an individual interaction model to infer which followee user will choose. Experimental results show that our model achieves better precision compared with other existing models. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.",
NETWORK STRUCTURE AND PATTERNS OF INFORMATION DIVERSITY ON TWITTER,MIS QUARTERLY,Sep 2018,2018,"Social media have great potential to support diverse information sharing, but there is widespread concern that platforms like Twitter do not result in communication between those who hold contradictory viewpoints. Because users can choose whom to follow, prior research suggests that social media users exist in echo chambers or become polarized. We seek evidence of this in a complete cross section of hyperlinks posted on Twitter, using previously validated measures of the political slant of news sources to study information diversity. Contrary to prediction, we find that the average account posts links to more politically moderate news sources than the ones they receive in their own feed. However, members of a tiny network core do exhibit cross-sectional evidence of polarization and are responsible for the majority of tweets received overall due to their popularity and activity, which could explain the widespread perception of polarization on social media.",
ABOUT RENEGADES AND OUTGROUP HATERS: MODELING THE LINK BETWEEN SOCIAL INFLUENCE AND INTERGROUP ATTITUDES,ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS,SEP-NOV 2018,2018,"Polarization between groups is a major topic of contemporary societal debate and research. Formal models of opinion dynamics try to explain how intergroup polarization arises from simple first principles of social interaction. In existing models, intergroup attitudes affect social influence in the form of homophily or xenophobia, fixed tendencies of individuals to be more open to influence from ingroup members or distance themselves from attitudes of outgroup members. These models generate polarization between groups, but they neglect a central insight from empirical research. Intergroup attitudes are themselves subject to social influence in interactions with both in- and outgroup members. A model is proposed in which the attitude which is subject to social influence is also an intergroup attitude. It affects in turn the influence process itself. Furthermore, it is shown how this changes model predictions about process and conditions of polarization between groups. More complex patterns of intergroup relations emerge than in a model with fixed xenophobia. Especially, a renegade minority ('outgroup lovers') is found to have a key role in avoiding mutually negative intergroup relations and even elicit reversed polarization, resulting in a majority of individuals developing a negative attitude towards their ingroup and a positive one for the outgroup.",
HOW DIFFERENT HOMOPHILY PREFERENCES MITIGATE AND SPUR ETHNIC AND VALUE SEGREGATION: SCHELLING'S MODEL EXTENDED,ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS,SEP-NOV 2018,2018,"In Schelling's segregation model, agents of two ethnic groups reside in a regular grid and aim to live in a neighborhood that matches the minimum desired fraction of members of the same ethnicity. The model shows that observed segregation can emerge from people interacting under spatial constraints following homophily preferences. Even mild preferences can generate high degrees of segregation at the macro level. In modern, ethnically diverse societies, people might not define similarity based on ethnicity. Instead, shared tolerance towards ethnic diversity might play a more significant role, impacting segregation and integration in societies. With this consideration, we extend Schelling's model by dividing the population of agents into value-oriented and ethnicity-oriented agents. Using parameter sweeping, we explore the consequences that the mutual adaptation of these two types of agents has on ethnic segregation, value segregation, and population density in the neighborhood. We examine for equally sized ethnic groups and for majority-minority conditions. The introduction of value-oriented agents reduces total ethnic segregation compared to Schelling's original model, but the new value segregation appears to be more pronounced than ethnic segregation. Due to spillover effects, stronger ethnic homophily preferences lead not only to greater ethnic segregation, but also to more value segregation. Stronger value-orientation of the tolerant agents similarly leads to increased ethnic segregation of the ethnicity-oriented agents. Also, value-oriented agents tend to live in neighborhoods with more agents than ethnicity-oriented agents. In majority-minority settings, such effects appear to be more drastic for the minority than the majority ethnicity.",
Why do ecologists search for co-authorships? Patterns of co-authorship networks in ecology (1977-2016),SCIENTOMETRICS,Sep 2018,2018,"Here, the pattern of co-authorship among ecologists was evaluated using a network approach that was built using four time periods (1977-1986, 1987-1996, 1997-2006, and 2007-2016). Furthermore, four potential explanations (geographic distance, word similarity, reputation asymmetry, and country development) for this pattern were evaluated. Distance and reputation asymmetry effects on collaboration have decreased in recent decades, whereas word similarity was a good predictor in recent decades. Of interest, country development was not a good predictor of co-authorship among ecologists.",
Disordered eating in college sorority women: A social network analysis of a subset of members from a single sorority chapter,APPETITE,Sep 1 2018,2018,"Objective: Disordered eating attitudes and behaviors are prevalent among college women, and peers appear to influence current and future eating pathology. Social network analysis (SNA) is an innovative quantitative method to examine relationships (i.e., ties) among people based on their various attributes. In this study, the social network of one sorority was modeled using exponential random graph model (ERGM) to explore if homophily, or the tendency for relationship ties to exist based on shared attributes, was present according to sorority members' disordered eating behaviors/attitudes and their body mass index (BMI).Method: Participants included members of one sorority at a large Southeastern university. All members were included on a roster unless they elected to opt out during the consent process, and 41 (19%) of the members completed the study measures. Participants completed the Social Network Questionnaire developed for this study (degree of ""liking"" of every member on the roster), the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), and a demographics questionnaire in exchange for one hour of community service credit.Results: The final sample consisted of mostly White women with an average age of 20. Homophily across liking ties was examined based on the EDE-Q Global scale, episodes of binge eating, and BMI. The greater the difference in EDE-Q Global scores, the more likely the participants were to like one another. The greater the difference in BMI, the less likely the participants were to like one another. Binge eating was unrelated to homophily.Discussion: College sorority women appear to prefer other women with dissimilar levels of disordered eating attitudes, suggesting complex interactions between stigmatized or valued disordered eating attributes. Women with similar BMI were more likely to like one another, confirming past findings.",
A complex network analysis of global tourism flows,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH,SEP-OCT 2018,2018,"In this paper, the global tourism network (GTN) is studied in order to gain insight about its structure and the interactions between source and destination markets. To concentrate on the main source and destination markets for each country, only its top k inbound and outbound flows are considered. The distribution of these most important ties in international tourism seems to be scale-free, with some occurrence of reciprocity, large transitivity, and high-degree centralization. The GTN shows a clustered structure determined by geographical as well as trade and cultural factors. Each major global and regional power seems to have a certain tourism sphere of influence. The network has a small world character and a high degree of geographic homophily, with more links within continents than between continents. Exponential random graph models have been fit to explain the observed global structure of the network based on its local interactions, and a number of significant motifs have been identified. The picture that results is a GTN that emerges from superimposed local processes in which tourism flows between countries is determined from multiple independent individual decisions made at the local level. This insight that global tourism patterns are driven by local processes is a major contribution of this research and can help develop strategic plans and cooperation partnerships at the national and regional levels, involving private and public stakeholders and targeting specific source and destination markets. The indicators computed using network analysis of global tourism flows can also be used to complement and enrich the information provided by current tourism statistics.",
Recommending diverse friends in signed social networks based on adaptive soft consensus paradigm using variable length genetic algorithm,WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Sep 2018,2018,"Despite the strategic role played by individuals, who act as intermediaries between distinct groups of people, the problem of recommending diverse friends in signed social networks (SSNs) still remains largely unexplored. Our model integrates homophily and diversity to develop an adaptive consensus based framework, which involves fuzzy group decision making analysis by leveraging on the signed social links and underlying users' preferences, to offer lists of connections which are diverse as well as relevant. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we modeled the fuzzy binary adjacency relations between users, thereafter referred as decision makers (DMs), exploiting users' preferences conferred on a set of items, and then higher order fuzzy m-ary adjacency relations are constructed to represent the grade of agreement between a set of m DMs. Further, in order to evaluate the relevance of each decision maker involved in the decision making process, we introduce a novel diversity measure based on the knowledge of socio-psychological theories and the information contained in social and interest links. Next, by employing variable-length genetic algorithm, an idea of adaptive consensus is explored to evolve groups of experts which are highly consensual as well as influential in the social network. Finally, on the basis of opinions gleaned from the members of these groups, sign of unknown links are predicted, thereby generating a top-N recommendations list of diverse friends. Extensive experimental study conducted on Epinions dataset illustrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional graph-based methods.",
Do birds of different feather flock together? Analyzing the political use of social media through a language-based approach in a multilingual context,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Sep 2018,2018,"This study analyzes the political use of Twitter in the run-up to the 2013 Malaysian General Election. It follows a content and social network analysis approach to investigate the interplay of language and political partisanship in social media use, among Twitter users in Malaysia. In the period leading up to the 2013 elections, Twitter posts collected under the hashtag #GE13 reveal that communities that post in English versus the Malay language, differ in how they use Twitter and with whom they interact. As compared to English users, Malay users are more likely to seek political information and express their political opinion. In online discussions, we observe language-based homophily within the English and Malay language communities, but there are some cross-cutting interactions between opposing political communities. We discuss the implications of our findings for the political use of new communication technologies in multi-ethnic and multilingual societies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Efficient service discovery in decentralized online social networks,FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE,Sep 2018,2018,"Online social networks (OSN) have attracted millions of users worldwide over the last decade. There are a series of urgent issues faced by existing OSN such as information overload, single-point of failure and privacy concerns. The booming Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing provide paradigms for the development of decentralized OSN. In this paper, we build a self-organized decentralized OSN (SDOSN) on the overlay network of an IoT infrastructure resembling real life social graph. A user model based on homophily features is proposed considering social relationships and user interests and focuses on the key OSN functionality of efficient information dissemination. A swarm intelligence search method is also proposed to facilitate adaptive forwarding and effective service discovery. Our evaluation, performed in simulation using real-world datasets, shows that our approach achieves better performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods in a dynamic network environment.

UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT AS A SUBJECT OF STUDY FOR SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGHER EDUCATION: A REVIEW,SIBIRSKIY PSIKHOLOGICHESKIY ZHURNAL-SIBERIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY,Sep 2018,2018,"University department is represented as a subject of study for social psychology of higher education, as the smallest group of specialists that carries the most important socio-psychological characteristics of the teaching and researching faculty at the higher education institution.A significant part of the article, in accordance with the traditions of social psychology, concentrates around the personality of the head of the department, his management style and relations with the dean and the administration of the university, fellow subordinates, students, their parents, and alumni. We discuss the shift from teaching and research to administrative tasks, roles, self-perception, styles, and personal characteristics of the head of the department (Gmelch, Miskin, 2004).After reviewing the relationships between the head of the department and his subordinates, the dean and other university leaders (Nellis, Harrington, 2007), the rest of the article we devote to the analysis of intradepartmental horizontal relations. We demonstrate that it is expedient to study the university department within the framework of the social networks theory (sets of participants and interpersonal relations that connect them with each other), which provides a more adequate language of description than the language of sympathies and antipathies of Moreno's sociometry.In particular, he admits the evaluation of the impact of personal and institutional factors on network choices and their limitations, participants' strategies, the structures of personal networks and benefits, resources allocated in the department according to the Ibarra's model (Pifer, 2010). Departments' networks can provide the faculty with access to information and other resources necessary for daily work and academic careers or restrict and block the access to them. Access to resources is distributed unevenly and can generate discrimination. Mutual trust is critical for obtaining access to network resources, and its absence is a limitation or barrier to them.The most important mechanism for establishing interpersonal relations by faculty members of the university department is homophily (assortativity). Homophily (assortativity) is the trend to interact and share opinion and behavior with ones similar in terms of professional and/or personal characteristics, measured, as a rule, by the correlation coefficient (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, Cook, 2001).Future research on university department is discussed. It is argued that socio-economic, technological and political processes of a planetary scale will force universities to achieve a new equilibrium point, to conclude a new mutually beneficial social contract with society and government, which will ensure the existence of the university department.",
Multivariate dynamics of one-mode and two-mode networks: Explaining similarity in sports participation among friends,NETWORK SCIENCE,Sep 2018,2018,"We examined social mechanisms that account for similarity in the social context of school-sponsored extracurricular sports activities among friends. We distinguish two social mechanisms: ""shared sports activities that lead to friendship,"" whereby friendship formation and maintenance are conditioned by joint sports participation, and ""friendship that leads to shared sports activities,"" a form of social influence whereby adolescents join or maintain certain sports activities based on their friends' choices. Using a longitudinal sample of 1,776 10th graders at five high schools in Southern California, we employed a stochastic actor-oriented multivariate dynamic model to model the dynamic interplay between the two-mode affiliation network of adolescents' participation in sports activities and the one-mode friendship network. As a corresponding descriptive method, we propose a quantitative measure for the relative strength of the two-mentioned mechanisms as explanations of the association between the one-mode and the two-mode network. Further, we introduce two specifications that represent homophily effects in the two-mode network and apply them to test gender homophily in sports participation. The results provide strong evidence for both mechanisms, with friendship leading to shared sport activities as stronger than shared sports activities leading to friendships in explaining adolescents' friendships with co-participants.",
The Impact of User Personality Traits on Word of Mouth: Text-Mining Social Media Platforms,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Sep 2018,2018,"Word of mouth (WOM) plays an increasingly important role in shaping consumers' behavior and preferences. In this paper, we examine whether latent personality traits of online users accentuate or attenuate the effectiveness of WOM in social media platforms. To answer this question, we leverage machine-learning methods in combination with econometric techniques utilizing a novel quasi-experiment. Our analysis yields two main results. First, there is a positive and statistically significant effect of the level of personality similarity between two social media users on the likelihood of a subsequent purchase from a recipient of a WOM message after exposure to the WOM message of the sender. In particular, exposure to WOM messages from similar users in terms of personality, rather than dissimilar users, increases the likelihood of a postpurchase by 47.58%. Second, there are statistically significant effects of specific pairwise combinations of personality characteristics of senders and recipients of WOM messages on the effectiveness of WOM. For instance, introverted users are responsive to WOM, in contrast to extroverted users. Besides this, agreeable, conscientious, and open social media users are more effective disseminators of WOM. In addition, WOM originating from users with low levels of emotional range affects similar users, whereas for high levels of emotional range, increased similarity usually has the opposite effect. The examined effects are also of significant economic importance, as, for instance, a WOM message from an extrovert user to an introvert peer increases the likelihood of a subsequent purchase by 71.28%. Our findings are robust to several alternative methods and specifications, such as controlling for latent user homophily and network structure roles based on deep-learning models. By extending the characteristics that have been theorized to affect the effectiveness of WOM from the observable to the latent space, tapping into users' latent personality characteristics, and illustrating how companies can leverage the abundance of unstructured data in social media, our paper provides actionable insights regarding the future potential of social media advertising and advanced microtargeting based on big data and deep learning.",
Socially Nudged: A Quasi-Experimental Study of Friends' Social Influence in Online Product Ratings,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Sep 2018,2018,"Social-networking functions are increasingly embedded in online rating systems. These functions alter the rating context in which consumer ratings are generated. In this paper, we empirically investigate online friends' social influence in online book ratings. Our quasi-experimental research design exploits the temporal sequence of social-networking events and ratings and offers a new method for identifying social influence while accounting for the homophily effect. We find that rating similarity between friends is significantly higher after the formation of the friend relationship, indicating that with social-networking functions, online rating contributors are socially nudged when giving their ratings. Exploration of contingent factors suggests that social influence is stronger for older books and for users who have smaller networks, and that relatively more recent and extremely negative ratings cast more salient influence.",
Homophily and Individual Performance,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,SEP-OCT 2018,2018,"We study the relationship between choice homophily in instrumental relationships and individual performance in knowledge-intensive organizations. Although homophily should make it easier for people to get access to some colleagues, it may also lead to neglecting relationships with other colleagues, reducing the diversity of information people access through their network. Using data on instrumental ties between bonus-eligible employees in the equity sales and trading division of a global investment bank, we show that the relationship between an employee's choice of similar colleagues and the employee's performance is contingent on the position this employee occupies in the formal and informal hierarchy of the bank. More specifically, homophily is negatively associated with performance for bankers in the higher levels of the formal and informal hierarchy whereas the association is either positive or nonexistent for lower hierarchical levels.",
Friend or frenemy? Experiential homophily and educational track attrition among premedical students,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Sep 2018,2018,"Support from experientially similar others-individuals who have been through the same life transition or faced a similar set of stressful circumstances-has been shown to be effective for coping with issues ranging from chronic illness to bereavement. Less research has examined how networks comprised of experientially similar others may shape academic outcomes. Using longitudinal egocentric network data collected from early career premedical students at a large research university (n = 268), results indicate that greater experiential homophily in premeds' networks are associated with a lower likelihood of departing from the premedical career track at the end of the academic year. Interview data (n = 39) highlight three support functions provided by premedical peers that help to explain this relationship: 1) concrete task assistance with assignments and studying, 2) empathic understanding and emotional support, and 3) advice and reassurance from more advanced peers. Results hint at the potential utility of peer support for the retention of students at-risk of straying from the premedical career track, and have implications for other fields of study.",
Spatial opinion dynamics and the effects of two types of mixing,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Aug 13 2018,2018,"Spatially situated opinions that can be held with different degrees of conviction lead to spatiotemporal patterns such as clustering (homophily), polarization, and deadlock. Our goal is to understand how sensitive these patterns are to changes in the local nature of interactions. We introduce two different mixing mechanisms, spatial relocation and nonlocal interaction (""telephoning""), to an earlier fully spatial model (no mixing). Interestingly, the mechanisms that create deadlock in the fully spatial model have the opposite effect when there is a sufficient amount of mixing. With telephoning, not only is polarization and deadlock broken up, but consensus is hastened. The effects of mixing by relocation are even more pronounced. Further insight into these dynamics is obtained for selected parameter regimes via comparison to the mean-field differential equations.",
Inequality as information: Wealth homophily facilitates the evolution of cooperation,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Aug 2 2018,2018,"Free-riding produces inequality in the prisoners' dilemma: cooperators suffer costs that defectors avoid, thus putting them at a material disadvantage to their anti-social peers. This inequality, accordingly, conveys information about a social partner's choices in past game play and raises the possibility that agents can use the aggregation of past payoffs-i. e. wealth-to identify a social partner who uses their same strategy. Building on these insights, we study a computational model in which agents can employ a strategy-when playing multiple one-shot prisoners' dilemma games per generation-in which they view other agents' summed payoffs from previous games, choose to enter a PD game with the agent whose summed payoffs most-closely approximate their own, and then always cooperate. Here we show that this strategy of wealth homophily-labelled COEQUALS (""CO-operate with EQUALS"")-can both invade an incumbent population of defectors and resist invasion. The strategy succeeds because wealth homophily leads agents to direct cooperation disproportionately toward others of their own type-a phenomenon known as "" positive assortment"". These findings illuminate empirical evidence indicating that viewable inequality degrades cooperation and they show how a standard feature of evolutionary game models-viz. the aggregation of payoffs during a generation-can double as an information mechanism that facilitates positive assortment.",
"Polarized Ukraine 2014: opinion and territorial split demonstrated with the bounded confidence by model, parametrized XY Twitter data",ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,Aug 2018,2018,"Multiple countries have recently experienced extreme political polarization, which, in some cases, led to escalation of hate crime, violence and political instability. Besides the much discussed presidential elections in the USA and France, Britain's Brexit vote and Turkish constitutional referendum showed signs of extreme polarization. Among the countries affected, Ukraine faced some of the gravest consequences. In an attempt to understand the mechanisms of these phenomena, we here combine social media analysis with agent-based modelling of opinion dynamics, targeting Ukraine's crisis of 2014. We use Twitter data to quantify changes in the opinion divide and parametrize an extended bounded confidence XY model, which provides a spatio-temporal description of the polarization dynamics. We demonstrate that the level of emotional intensity is a major driving force for polarization that can lead to a spontaneous onset of collective behaviour at a certain degree of homophily and conformity. We find that the critical level of emotional intensity corresponds to a polarization transition, marked by a sudden increase in the degree of involvement and in the opinion bimodality.",
"A decade of dynamics of residential location, car ownership, activity, travel and land use in the Seattle metropolitan region",TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,Aug 2018,2018,"Using data of attitudes in the Puget Sound region we first identify predispositions in favor of car use (car loving persons and households) and distinguish them from other predispositions favoring other modes (transit and carsharing lovers). Then we explore if like-minded people (homophily) live together and examine heterogeneity within their households. To do this we analyze attitudinal data using multilevel latent class clustering that allows identification of groups of persons and groups of households jointly. Our analysis identifies distinct groups of people with different attitudes towards modes and we do not find strong homophily in attitudes within households. The distinction of attitudes among persons transfers well to the household level giving us the opportunity to identify and test differences among the different attitudinal groups using longitudinal records. We then move to a longitudinal analysis using a small sample of households that participated in more than ten years of the Puget Sound panel survey to explore the sequence of their residential location characteristics, car ownership, and travel. We find in descriptive statistics and in a second application of multilevel cluster models that carpool and transit loyalty persists over time by a portion of car pool and transit lovers. We also find sustained use of cars by car loving households, sustained car use of a neutral in attitudes group, a group of younger households with positive attitudes towards carsharing and sustained car sharing over time, and a possibly disenfranchised older household group lacking access to opportunities. The inclusion in the analysis of the two residential location characteristics (evolution of density and diversity around the household residence) enabled a more complete analysis and a clearer description of household context for both attitudes and behavior.",
What Buffers Ethnic Homophily? Explaining the Development of Outgroup Contact in Adolescence,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Aug 2018,2018,"Although literature provides strong evidence for the beneficial role of outgroup contact, longitudinal knowledge regarding the formation and change of outgroup contact remains improvable. Using a longitudinal, large-scale data set including 6,726 majority and minority participants (M-age = 14.98 years at Wave 1;55% female) from 4 western European countries that were followed in 3 waves over 2 years, we systematically examined the development of outgroup contact during adolescence and tested the role of hypothesized predictors (i.e., intergroup attitudes and social identity) for explaining this development. In the majority, growth curve models revealed consistent patterns of ethnic homophily characterized by a continuous decline of outgroup contact, whereas this negative growth was buffered by a positive change of intergroup attitudes and a negative change of national identity during adolescence. In contrast, in the minority, outgroup contact was characterized by higher mean levels and a nonlinear development (i.e., no systematic decline or increase) of outgroup contact. Findings highlight the developmental importance of adolescence for promoting positive intergroup relations, especially for the majority, and emphasize the usefulness of contact interventions with adolescent students in school.",
The Integration of Racial and Ethnic Minorities into White Congregations,SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,Aug 2018,2018,"Drawing from the homophily principle and organizational ecology theory, I follow previous literature and predict racial minorities will have lower levels of belonging and commitment when attending predominantly white congregations. Going beyond this literature, I incorporate contemporary racial stratification literature and propose integration into white congregations would vary by racial group as a result of the differing symbolic group positioning of minorities in America's racial hierarchy. Results from multilevel models using a national dataset generally support my hypotheses. The findings from this study reveal distinctions between minority racial groups within predominantly white congregations. Thus, the homophily principle and organizational ecology are not sufficient when studying race within congregations, as it is not enough to rely solely on the numeric representation of racial groups in congregations without taking into account the social positioning of these groups. These results, their implications, and potential directions for future studies are further discussed.",
Generalized Gelation Theory Describes Onset of Online Extremist Support,PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS,Jul 27 2018,2018,"We introduce a generalized form of gelation theory that incorporates individual heterogeneity and show that it can explain the asynchronous, sudden appearance and growth of online extremist groups supporting ISIS (so-called Islamic State) that emerged globally post-2014. The theory predicts how heterogeneity impacts their onset times and growth profiles and suggests that online extremist groups present a broad distribution of heterogeneity-dependent aggregation mechanisms centered around homophily. The good agreement between the theory and empirical data suggests that existing strategies aiming to defeat online extremism under the assumption that it is driven by a few ""bad apples"" are misguided. More generally, this generalized theory should apply to a range of real-world systems featuring aggregation among heterogeneous objects.",
Homophily influences ranking of minorities in social networks,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Jul 23 2018,2018,"Homophily can put minority groups at a disadvantage by restricting their ability to establish links with a majority group or to access novel information. Here, we show how this phenomenon can influence the ranking of minorities in examples of real-world networks with various levels of heterophily and homophily ranging from sexual contacts, dating contacts, scientific collaborations, and scientific citations. We devise a social network model with tunable homophily and group sizes, and demonstrate how the degree ranking of nodes from the minority group in a network is a function of (i) relative group sizes and (ii) the presence or absence of homophilic behaviour. We provide analytical insights on how the ranking of the minority can be improved to ensure the representativeness of the group and correct for potential biases. Our work presents a foundation for assessing the impact of homophilic and heterophilic behaviour on minorities in social networks.",
Peer effects on adolescent smoking: Are popular teens more influential?,PLOS ONE,Jul 12 2018,2018,"Previous research on adolescent cigarette adoption has focused on peer influence and the perceived status gain from smoking but has ignored the status effects on peer influence. We analyze adolescent peer effects on cigarette consumption while considering the popularity of peers. The analysis is based on a four wave panel survey representative of American high school students. We measure peers' popularity by their eigenvector centrality in high school social networks. Using lagged peers' behavior, school fixed effects, and instrumental variables to control for homophily and contextual confounds, we find that the probability of smoking the following year increases with the mean popularity of smokers, while the popularity of non-smokers has the opposite effect. These effects persist seven and fourteen years later (wave 3 and 4 of the data). In addition, the probability of smoking increases with the smoking propensity of the 20% most popular teens and decreases with the smoking propensity of the bottom 80%. The results indicate the importance of knowing not only the smoking propensity within a school but also the location of smokers within the social hierarchy.",
Inter-layer competition in adaptive multiplex network,NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,Jul 12 2018,2018,"We consider competition between layers in adaptive multiplex networks of phase oscillators, where adaptation principles (which cause intra-layer topology evolution) are inspired by real world homophily and homeostasis phenomena. Our model yields the emergence of both scale-free topologies and meso-scale structures in the layers, for an appropriate choice of the control parameters. We further report that the growth of the number of interacting layers leads to a decrease of the global order, due to inter-layer structural competition. However, the increase of the system's scale can effect local synchronization between neighboring (or strongly coupled) nodes. Such unforeseen phenomena is connected with the nature of the competitive mechanism, which implies the rivalry for optimal structure within the whole system, a situation occurring in a variety of natural systems.",
From Face-to-Face to Facebook: Probing the Effects of Passive Consumption on Interpersonal Attraction,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,Jul 10 2018,2018,"Social media is radically altering the human social landscape. Before the internet era, human interaction consisted chiefly of direct and reciprocal contact, yet with the rise of social media, the passive consumption of other users' information is becoming an increasingly popular pastime. Passive consumption occurs when a user reads the posts of another user without interacting with them in any way. Previous studies suggest that people feel more connected to an artificial person after passively consuming their Facebook posts. This finding could help explain how relationships develop during passive consumption and what motivates this kind of social media use. This protocol proposes two studies that would make both a methodological and a theoretical contribution to the field of social media research. Both studies investigate the influence of passive consumption on changes in interpersonal attraction. The first study tests whether screenshots, which are widely used in present research, can be used as a proxy for real Facebook use. It measures the changes in interpersonal attraction after passive consumption of either a screenshot, an artificial in situ profile, or an acquaintance's real Facebook profile. The second study relies on traditional theories of relationship formation and motivation to investigate which variables (perceived intimacy, perceived frequency of posts, perceived variety of post topics, attributional confidence, and homophily) moderate the link between interpersonal attraction before and after passive consumption. The results of the first study provide insights into the generalizability of the effect by using different stimuli, while also providing a valuable investigation into a commonly used method in the research field. The results of the second study supplement researchers' understanding of the pathways linking passive use and interpersonal attraction, giving the field further insight into whether theories about offline relationship formation can be used in an online context. Taken together, this protocol aims to shed light on the intricate relation between passive consumption and interpersonal attraction, and variables moderating this effect.",
Network Evolution and Social Situations,SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Jul 5 2018,2018,"Studying the evolution of friendship networks has a long tradition in sociology. Multiple micromechanisms underlying friendship formation have been discovered, the most pervasive being reciprocity, transitivity, and homophily. Although each mechanism is studied in depth on its own, their relation to one another is rarely analyzed, and a theoretical framework that integrates research on all of them does not exist. This article introduces a friendship evolution model, which proposes that each micromechanism is related to interactions in different social situations. Based on this model, decreasing returns to embedding in multiple mechanisms are hypothesized. Complete social network data of adolescents and statistical network models are used to test these hypotheses. Results show a consistently negative interaction in line with the formulated model. The consequences of this negative relation between the network evolution mechanisms are explored in a simulation study, which suggests that this is a strong determinant of network-level integration and segregation.",

The role of social proximity in professional CEO appointments: Evidence from caste/religion-based hiring of CEOs in India,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Jul 2018,2018,"Research Summary: The role of homophily in CEO appointments at the largest corporations is an important subject in corporate governance. This subject is particularly important in a country like India where a multitude of religions, castes, and communities form its social fabric. We test for the role of homophily in professional CEO appointments in India by empirically examining the preference for same caste/religion CEOs by the largest firms. Using a unique dataset, assembled by detailed identification of castes/religions from family names and counterfactuals obtained through the Coarsened Exact Matching technique, we find that caste/religion plays a crucial role in CEO selection as a source of information (positive discrimination). The evidence is not consistent with its use to pursue taste-based preferences (negative discrimination).Managerial Summary: We test for the role of homophily in the appointments of CEOs in India by empirically examining the preference for same caste/religion CEOs by the largest firms. We find that caste/religion plays an important role in CEO selection, i.e., as a form of information or ""positive discrimination."" The evidence is not consistent with its use to pursue taste-based preferences or ""negative discrimination.""",

Suchecki and J. Holyst, Phys. Rev. E 96, 042306 (2017).] is further generalized here, including spin-dependent probability of rewiring. Mean field results indicate that either the system splits into two separate networks with different spins, or one spin orientation goes extinct. In both cases, the density of active links is equal to zero. The results are discussed in terms of homophily in social contacts.",
Do women leaders promote positive change? Analyzing the effect of gender on business practices and diversity initiatives,HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT,JUL-AUG 2018,2018,"While most scholarship on gender leadership diversity and organizational outcomes considers the impact of board composition on firm performance, we consider the impact of women CEOs and board members together on a range of organizational outcomes. We test three competing theoretical perspectives related to gender in organizations: gender difference, homophily, and diversity. We rely on a unique data set of CEO characteristics, board composition and firm outcomes of all Fortune 500 companies from 2001 to 2010. We find that firms with women CEOs or gender diverse boards are associated with stronger business and equity practices. We also find that gender diverse leadership teams demonstrate stronger business and equity outcomes than teams characterized by gender homophily.",
Mobility Assisted Content Transmission For Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,Jul 2018,2018,"With the explosion growth of mobile data demands for proximal services, device-to-device communication is proposed as a vital technology for the next generation cellular network. With the extensive increase in personal mobile devices, content transmission of proximal devices underlaying cellular networks is gaining considerable attention. However, due to the mobility constraint of mobile devices, content transmission underlaying cellular networks greatly affects the overall transmission capacity of these proximal devices. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mobility assisted content transmission and resource allocation by exploiting the contact patterns regulated by these proximal devices' mobility. We formulate the content transmission and resource allocation with the help of the statistic property of contact rates, and then utilize convex optimization to determine the successful content transmission and resource allocation scheme. We present the optimal resource allocated content transmission algorithm based on the pseudo-polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem. Real data traces are utilized in our proposed algorithm to find out the natural strategies of mobile homophily. Extensive simulations under the realistic human mobility factors are evaluated to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed scheme.",
Measuring the Graph Concordance of Locally Dependent Observations,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,Jul 2018,2018,"This paper introduces a simple measure of a concordance pattern among observed outcomes along a network, that is, the pattern in which adjacent outcomes tend to be more strongly correlated than nonadjacent outcomes. The graph concordance measure can be generally used to quantify the empirical relevance of a network in explaining cross-sectional dependence of the outcomes, and as shown in the paper, it can also be used to quantify the extent of homophily under certain conditions. When one observes a single large network, it is nontrivial to make inferences about the concordance pattern. Assuming a dependency graph, this paper develops a permutation-based confidence interval for the graph concordance measure. The confidence interval is valid in finite samples when the outcomes are exchangeable, and under the dependency graph, an assumption together with other regularity conditions, is shown to exhibit asymptotic validity. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the validity of the permutation method is more robust than the asymptotic method to various graph configurations.",
"Local secessions, homophily, and growth. A model with some evidence from the regions of Abruzzo and Molise (Italy, 1963)",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,Jul 2018,2018,"This paper analyses the case of a local secession, i.e. the birth of a new local jurisdiction by separation from an existing one. We present a stylized model in which society is composed of heterogeneous groups and individuals have an homophily bias. The model predicts that: (i) separations, such as the split of a territory into distinct administrative units, occur when the costs of mixed communities are sufficiently large; (ii) the smaller community drives the decision to secede; (iii) welfare gains from the split are associated with positive population growth; (iv) higher payoffs under separations, however, might be related to taste for sameness only, with no (or even negative) effect on economic growth. Empirically, we exploit the secession of the Italian region of Molise from Abruzzo in 1963, a unique event in Italian history. Historical records document that the split was the result of pressures from Molise, the smaller community. Our evidence suggests that the split was associated with population inflows in both areas. Finally, by using a synthetic control approach, we show that the split caused significant benefits to per-capita GDP growth, in both regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Motivating Human-Enabled Mobile Participation for Data Offloading,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING,Jul 1 2018,2018,"The exploding popularity of mobile devices enables people to enjoy benefits brought by various interesting mobile apps. However, the ever-increasing data traffic has exacerbated the congestion on current cellular networks, which results in users' dissatisfaction, especially in crowded areas. Hence, how to alleviate data traffic in cellular networks becomes a challenging problem. Traditional methods rely on mobile offloading techniques to deviate the data traffic originally targeted to cellular networks, such as the small cell, Wi-Fi, and opportunistic communication. Unfortunately, mobile users still experience severe congestion when a large number of users request for data. Facing these challenges, we introduce the concept of mobile participation to assist data offloading by leveraging the mobility of users and the social features among a group of users. A mobile caching user, who pre-caches a certain amount of contents, will roam around congested areas to participate in content dissemination in order to satisfy users' requests, which is expected to benefit both himself and users in the crowd simultaneously. To motivate such human-enabled mobile participation for data offloading, a Stackelberg game is deployed with joint considerations on social effect and delay effect. Based on detailed performance analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach.",
Partner selection and social capital in the status attainment process,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Jul 2018,2018,"Why is individual success so strongly affected by parental socioeconomic status? We argue that parental socioeconomic status affects the socioeconomic status of one's romantic partner, thereby partially determining one's own social capital and socioeconomic status. Censored-inflated structural equation models using data from the NEtherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (NELLS) and British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) confirm these relationships, while cross lagged analyses suggest that they may be causal in nature. The strong tendency for people to have a romantic partner that reflects their socioeconomic origin shows how far the influence of the parental home stretches and why it does so.",
Crossing the Age Divide: Cross-Age Collaboration Between Programs Serving Transition-Age Youth,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES & RESEARCH,Jul 2018,2018,"Programs that serve transition-age youth with serious mental health conditions typically reside in either the child or the adult system. Good service provision calls for interactions among these programs. The objective of this research was to discover programmatic characteristics that facilitate or impede collaboration with programs serving dissimilar age groups, among programs that serve transition-age youth. To examine this ""cross-age collaboration,"" this research used social network analysis methods to generate homophily and heterophily scores in three communities that had received federal grants to improve services for this population. Heterophily scores (i.e., a measure of cross-age collaboration) in programs serving only transition-age youth were significantly higher than the heterophily scores of programs that served only adults or only children. Few other program markers or malleable program factors predicted heterophily. Programs that specialize in serving transition-age youth are a good resource for gaining knowledge of how to bridge adult and child programs.",
Alternative estimation methods for identifying contagion effects in dynamic social networks: A latent-space adjusted approach,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2018,2018,"Contagion effects, also known as peer effects or social influence process, have become more and more central to social science, especially with the availability of longitudinal social network data. However, contagion effects are usually difficult to identify, as they are often entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process, the individual's preference for the same social settings, etc. Methods currently available either do not solve these problems or require strong assumptions. Following Shalizi and Thomas (2011), I frame this difficulty as an omitted variable bias problem, and I propose several alternative estimation methods that have potentials to correctly identify contagion effects when there is an unobserved trait that co-determines the influence and the selection. The Monte-Carlo simulation results suggest that a latent-space adjusted estimator is especially promising. It outperforms other estimators that are traditionally used to deal with the unobserved variables, including a structural equation based estimator and an instrumental variable estimator.

Birds of a feather scam together: Trustworthiness homophily in a business network,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2018,2018,"Estimating the trustworthiness of a set of actors when all the available information is provided by the actors themselves is a hard problem. When two actors have conflicting reports about each other, how do we establish which of the two (if any) deserves our trust? In this paper, we model this scenario as a network problem: actors are nodes in a network and their reports about each other are the edges of the network. To estimate their trustworthiness levels, we develop an iterative framework which looks at all the reports about each connected actor pair to define its trustworthiness balance. We apply this framework to a customer/supplier business network. We show that our trustworthiness score is a significant predictor of the likelihood a business will pay a fine if audited. We show that the market network is characterized by homophily: businesses tend to connect to partners with similar trustworthiness degrees. This suggests that the topology of the network influences the behavior of the actors composing it, indicating that market regulatory efforts should take into account network theory to prevent further degeneration and failures.

Heating up the debate? Measuring fragmentation and polarisation in a German climate change hyperlink network,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2018,2018,"Research into polarisation on the internet has so far primarily focused on contentious issues and yielded contradictory results. Shifting the focus to a non-contentious setting, this article combines community detection with brokerage analysis and exponential random graph models to assess the degree of polarisation at different levels of a German hyperlink network on climate change. Although homophily accounts for a moderate degree of polarisation at the top level of the network, the communities reveal that other factors prove more decisive in shaping its structure and the article thus contributes to a more refined understanding of the nature of online polarisation.

Coupled Node Similarity Learning for Community Detection in Attributed Networks,ENTROPY,Jun 2018,2018,"Attributed networks consist of not only a network structure but also node attributes. Most existing community detection algorithms only focus on network structures and ignore node attributes, which are also important. Although some algorithms using both node attributes and network structure information have been proposed in recent years, the complex hierarchical coupling relationships within and between attributes, nodes and network structure have not been considered. Such hierarchical couplings are driving factors in community formation. This paper introduces a novel coupled node similarity (CNS) to involve and learn attribute and structure couplings and compute the similarity within and between nodes with categorical attributes in a network. CNS learns and integrates the frequency-based intra-attribute coupled similarity within an attribute, the co-occurrence-based inter-attribute coupled similarity between attributes, and coupled attribute-to-structure similarity based on the homophily property. CNS is then used to generate the weights of edges and transfer a plain graph to a weighted graph. Clustering algorithms detect community structures that are topologically well-connected and semantically coherent on the weighted graphs. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CNS-based community detection algorithms on several data sets by comparing with the state-of-the-art node similarity measures, whether they involve node attribute information and hierarchical interactions, and on various levels of network structure complexity.",
The Effects of Ethnic Minority Adolescents' Ethnic Self-Identification on Friendship Selection,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE,Jun 2018,2018,"This study investigated the effects of ethnic minority adolescents' ethnic self-identification (host country, dual, or heritage country) on friendship choices among ethnic majority and minority peers. Hypotheses were derived from similarity-attraction and social identity theory and tested using longitudinal social network data from 1,004 middle school students (five schools) in Germany. Results showed that ethnic minority adolescents' ethnic self-identification affected friendship selection beyond ethnic homophily. While host country and dual identification was beneficial with respect to friendships with both ethnic majority and minority peers, heritage country identification was detrimental to relations with both of them.",
"Respondent driven sampling in a biomonitoring study of refugees from Burma in Buffalo, New York who eat Great Lakes fish",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,Jun 2018,2018,"Background: Refugees from Burma who consume fish caught from local waterbodies have increased risk of exposure to environmental contaminants. We used respondent driven sampling (RDS) to sample this hard-to reach population for the first Biomonitoring of Great Lakes Populations program. In the current study, we examined the interview data and assessed the effectiveness of RDS to sample the unique population.Methods: In 2013, we used RDS to sample 205 Burmese refugees and immigrants residing in Buffalo, New York who consumed fish caught from Great Lakes waters. RDS-adjusted population estimates of sociodemographic characteristics, residential history, fish consumption related behaviors, and awareness of fish advisories were obtained. We also examined sample homophily and equilibrium to assess how well the RDS assumptions were met in the study.Results: Our sample was diverse with respect to sex, age, years residing in Buffalo, years lived in a refugee camp, education, employment, and fish consumption behaviors, and each of these variables reached equilibrium by the end of recruitment. Burmese refugees in Buffalo consumed Great Lakes fish throughout the year; a majority of them consumed the fish more than two times per week during summer, and about one third ate local fish more than once per week in winter. An estimated 60% of Burmese refugees in Buffalo had heard about local fish advisories.Conclusions: RDS has the potential to be an effective methodology for sampling refugees and immigrants in conducting biomonitoring and environmental exposure assessment. Due to high fish consumption and limited awareness and knowledge of fish advisories, some refugee and immigrant populations are more susceptible to environmental contaminants. Increased awareness on local fish advisories is needed among these populations.",
On Direct vs. Indirect Peer Influence in Large Social Networks,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Jun 2018,2018,"With the availability of large-scale network data, peer influence in social networks can be more rigorously examined and understood than before. Peer influence can arise from immediate neighbors in the network (formally defined as cohesion or direct ties with one-hop neighbors) and from indirect peers who share common neighbors (formally defined as structural equivalence or indirect ties with two-hop neighbors). While the literature examined the role of each peer influence (direct or indirect) separately, the study of both peer network effects acting simultaneously was ignored, largely because of methodological constraints. This paper attempts to fill this gap by evaluating the simultaneous effect of both direct and indirect peer influences in technology adoption in the context of caller ringback tone (CRBT) in a cellular telephone network, using data from 200 million calls by 1.4 million users. Given that such a large-scale network makes traditional social network analysis intractable, we extract many densely connected and self-contained subpopulations from the network. We find a regularity in these subpopulations in that they consist either of about 200 nodes or about 500 nodes. Using these subpopulations and panel data, we analyze direct and indirect peer influences using a novel autoprobit model with multiple network terms (direct and indirect peer influence, with homophily as a control variable). Our identification strategy relies on a newly designed spatial autoregressive model, allowing us to identify the direct and indirect peer influences on each of the extracted subpopulations. We use meta-analysis to summarize the estimated parameters from all subpopulations. The results show CRBT adoption to be simultaneously determined by both direct and indirect peer influence (while controlling for homophily and centrality). Robustness checks show model fit to improve when both peer influences are included. The size and direction of the two peer influences, however, differ by group size. Interestingly, indirect peer influence (structural equivalence) plays a negative role in diffusion when group size is about 200, but a positive role when group size is about 500. The role of direct peer influence (cohesion), on the other hand, is always positive, irrespective of group size. Our findings imply that businesses must design different target strategies for large versus small groups: for large groups, businesses should focus on consumers with both multiple one-hop and two-hop neighbors; for small groups, businesses should only focus on consumers with multiple one-hop neighbors.",
"The ""Tough on Crime"" Competition: a Network Approach to Understanding the Social Mechanisms Leading to Federal Crime Control Legislation in the United States from 1973-2014",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,Jun 2018,2018,"The increase in punitive sentiment in America over the last four decades is frequently attributed to changes in criminal justice policies and programs. While scholars have studied the impact of legislation and policy on justice system outcomes, less attention has focused on the role of political actors in legislative bodies who are largely responsible for enacting criminal justice legislation. The current study addresses this gap by examining the social organization of federal crime control policy in the U.S. Congress over a forty-two year period (1973-2014). Drawing from research on social network mechanisms, we examine whether crime control legislation was more politically attractive relative to other legislative topics, and whether Democrats and Republicans pursue these policies by working together or competing against each other. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanisms that contributed to the punitive movement at the federal level.",

Using a social network analysis, content analysis, and cluster analysis, political characteristics of online networks that formed around discussions of fake news were examined. This study found that fake news is a politicized term where conversations overshadowed logical and important discussions of the term. Findings also revealed that social media users from opposing political parties communicate in homophilous environments and use fake news to disparage the opposition and condemn real information disseminated by the opposition party members.",
City membership in climate change adaptation networks,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,Jun 2018,2018,"By sharing best practices and lessons learned among member cities, professional and learning networks have become prominent actors in supporting and shaping local climate change adaptation. I analyze the membership of 18 highly visible adaptation learning networks to determine what cities participate and if networks attract similar cities. I find that the formation of adaptation networks is driven by large, high-capacity cities. Adaptation networks include members of diverse sizes and planning capacity, however, cities with similar levels of social vulnerability and concern with climate change tend to participate in the same networks. Global and regional networks have different patterns of membership. These patterns of membership have important implications for diffusing climate change adaptation between cities.",
IT’S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW BUT WHO YOU KNOW: HETEROGENEOUS PEER EFFECTS AT A COLOMBIAN UNIVERSITY,Desarrollo y Sociedad,2018-06,2018,"Abstract This paper uses matched survey and administrative data on first-year Economics students who were studying at the Javeriana University in Bogotá, Colombia, in 2015 in order to estimate peer effects on student grades. We employ the strategy proposed by De Giorgi, Pellizzari & Redaelli (2010) to identify and estimate these peer effects. Our results show that peer effects are economically significant in their context, that they result from the sharing of specific rather than general skills among peers, and that they flow mainly from peers with whom students interact frequently and who are considered to be leaders.",
Personality Homophily and Geographic Distance in Facebook,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,Jun 2018,2018,"Personality homophily remains an understudied aspect of social networks, with the traditional focus concerning sociodemographic variables as the basis for assortativity, rather than psychological dispositions. We consider the effect of personality homophily on one of the biggest constraints to human social networks: geographic distance. We use the Big five model of personality to make predictions for each of the five facets: Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Using a network of 313,669 Facebook users, we investigate the difference in geographic distance between homophilous pairs, in which both users scored similarly on a particular facet, and mixed pairs. In accordance with our hypotheses, we find that pairs of open and conscientious users are geographically further apart than mixed pairs. Pairs of extraverts, on the other hand, tend to be geographically closer together. We find mixed results for the Neuroticism facet, and no significant effects for the Agreeableness facet. The results are discussed in the context of personality homophily and the impact of geographic distance on social connections.",
Mapping the international health aid community using web data,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,May 8 2018,2018,"International aid is a complex system: it involves different issues, countries, and donors. In this paper, we use web crawling to collect information about the activities of international aid organizations on different health-related topics and network analysis to depict this complex system of relationships among organizations. By systematically collecting co-occurrences of issues, countries, and organization names from more than a hundred websites, we are able to construct multilayer networks describing, for instance, which issues are related to each other according to which organizations. Our results show that there is a surprising amount of homophily among organizations: organizations of the same type (multilateral, bilateral, private donors, etc.) tend to be co-cited in groups. We also create a taxonomy of issues that are generally mentioned together. Finally, we perform simulations, showing that messages originating from different organizations in the international aid community can have a different reach.",
Political topic-communities and their framing practices in the Dutch Twittersphere,INTERNET POLICY REVIEW,May 2018,2018,"In light of the need for political plurality and informed debate this study questions information distribution and curation on Twitter. We contribute to the understanding of ideological homophily by exploring the notion of the 'echo chamber'. Using a sample of two weeks of Dutch Twitter data, we combine network analysis of retweet networks, with qualitative reading and categorisation of engagement with media content in tweets within political topic communities. We found that media references were predominantly framed in affirmative ways in relation to the referenced medium content. Our findings show that users consciously select media messages that correspond with the general sentiment within their topic community, or frame them accordingly. We see this as a willful 'echo chamber', or a 'repillarisation'.",
Factors associated with HIV infection among female sex workers in Brazil,MEDICINE,May 2018,2018,"Background:Female sex workers (FSWs) are one of the most-at-risk population groups for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This paper aims at identifying the main predictors of HIV infection among FSW recruited in the 2nd Biological and Behavioral Surveillance Survey in 12 Brazilian cities in 2016.Method:Data were collected on 4245 FSW recruited by respondent driven sampling (RDS). Weights were inversely proportional to participants' network sizes. To establish the correlates of HIV infection, we used logistic regression models taking into account the dependence of observations resultant from the recruitment chains. The analysis included socio-demographic sex work characteristics, sexual behavior, history of violence, alcohol and drug use, utilization of health services, and occurrence of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Results:HIV prevalence was estimated as 5.3% (4.4%-6.2%). The odds ratio (OR) of an HIV-positive recruiter choosing an HIV-positive participant was 3.9 times higher than that of an HIV-negative recruiter (P<.001). Regarding socio-demographic and sex work characteristics, low educational level, street as the main work venue, low price per sexual encounter, and longer exposure time as a sex worker were found to be associated with HIV infection, even after controlling for the homophily effect. The OR of being HIV infected among FSW who had been exposed to sexual violence at least once in a lifetime (OR=1.5, P=.028) and the use of illicit drugs at least once a week were highly significant as well, particularly for frequent crack use (OR=3.6, P<.001). Among the sexual behavior indicators, not using condoms in some circumstances were significantly associated with HIV infection (OR=1.8, P=.016). Regarding the occurrence of other STI, the odds of being HIV infected was significantly higher among FSW with a reactive treponemal test for syphilis (OR=4.6, P<.001).Conclusions:The main factors associated with HIV infection identified in our study characterize a specific type of street-based sex work in Brazil and provided valuable information for developing interventions. However, there is a further need of addressing social and contextual factors, including illicit drug use, violence, exploitation, as well as stigma and discrimination, which can influence sexual behavior.",
"HIV, HCV, HBV, and syphilis among transgender women from Brazil: Assessing different methods to adjust infection rates of a hard-to-reach, sparse population",MEDICINE,May 2018,2018,"Different sampling strategies, analytic alternatives, and estimators have been proposed to better assess the characteristics of different hard-to-reach populations and their respective infection rates (as well as their sociodemographic characteristics, associated harms, and needs) in the context of studies based on respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Despite several methodological advances and hundreds of empirical studies implemented worldwide, some inchoate findings and methodological challenges remain. The in-depth assessment of the local structure of networks and the performance of the available estimators are particularly relevant when the target populations are sparse and highly stigmatized. In such populations, bottlenecks as well as other sources of biases (for instance, due to homophily and/or too sparse or fragmented groups of individuals) may be frequent, affecting the estimates.In the present study, data were derived from a cross-sectional, multicity RDS study, carried out in 12 Brazilian cities with transgender women (TGW). Overall, infection rates for HIV and syphilis were very high, with some variation between different cities. Notwithstanding, findings are of great concern, considering the fact that female TGW are not only very hard-to-reach but also face deeply-entrenched prejudice and have been out of the reach of most therapeutic and preventive programs and projects.We cross-compared findings adjusted using 2 estimators (the classic estimator usually known as estimator II, originally proposed by Volz and Heckathorn) and a brand new strategy to adjust data generated by RDS, partially based on Bayesian statistics, called for the sake of this paper, the RDS-B estimator. Adjusted prevalence was cross-compared with estimates generated by non-weighted analyses, using what has been called by us a naive estimator or rough estimates.",
"GENDER DISPARITIES IN SCIENCE? DROPOUT, PRODUCTIVITY, COLLABORATIONS AND SUCCESS OF MALE AND FEMALE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS",ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS,MAY-JUN 2018,2018,"Scientific collaborations shape ideas as well as innovations and are both the substrate for, and the outcome of, academic careers. Recent studies show that gender inequality is still present in many scientific practices ranging from hiring to peer-review processes and grant applications. In this work, we investigate gender-specific differences in collaboration patterns of more than one million computer scientists over the course of 47 years. We explore how these patterns change over years and career ages and how they impact scientific success. Our results highlight that successful male and female scientists reveal the same collaboration patterns: compared to scientists in the same career age, they tend to collaborate with more colleagues than other scientists, seek innovations as brokers and establish longer-lasting and more repetitive collaborations. However, women are on average less likely to adopt the collaboration patterns that are related with success, more likely to embed into ego networks devoid of structural holes, and they exhibit stronger gender homophily as well as a consistently higher dropout rate than men in all career ages.",
Gender inequalities in the City of London advertising industry,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE,May 2018,2018,"This paper explores gender relations in the City of London advertising industry. It argues that the gender imbalance in the highest ranking positions and the stifled career progression of women in the industry are a result of social, structural and institutional factors rather than individual choice, lack of 'talent' or the absence of mentors or appropriate role models. We discuss the organisation and spatiality of the advertising industry in London, significance of social networking within and beyond the firm, and problematise the notion that female childbearing and caring are the primary determinants of women's truncated career trajectories in advertising. The research reveals that whilst age, gender and domestic divisions of labour combine to reinforce occupational sexual divisions of labour in the advertising industry in London, these inequality regimes are amplified by the industry's precariousness, informality and requirements for flexibility. Attempting to explain away gendered divisions of labour solely on the basis of women's role in social reproduction deflects attention away from other key determinants of inequality, most notably the pace of advertising work and the geographical concentration of the industry within London. These are further accentuated by deep-rooted forms of homophily and homosociality - those unspeakable inequalities that call into question the dominant post-feminist rhetoric that 'all the battles have been won'. We analyse the ways in which homosociality has been crucial in maintaining insidious sexism which has made it very difficult for female creatives to obtain the most prestigious roles at work. Taken together, the organisation and geography of the sector, the rhetoric of buzz and egalitarianism, the 'motherhood myth' and the homophilic practices at work within advertising combine to create deep and enduring gendered inequalities.",
The network of global migration 1990-2013 Using ERGMs to test theories of migration between countries,SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2018,2018,"For the period 1990-2013, 202 countries are analysed as nodes linked by in- or out-migration of substantial shares of the sending country's population. The resulting network shows regional, but also ""cultural"" clustering. Variants of ERGMs are used to determine geographic, demographic, economic, religious, linguistic as well as historical factors of migration between countries. Results are in line with gravity models, theories of global inequality, hegemonic languages and religious homophily, even though not all effects are fully consistent across all models. Moreover, former colonies show higher out-degree and there are strong network-structural effects indicating a hierarchy in attractiveness between countries for unobserved reasons.

"Birds of a schedule flock together: Social networks, peer influence, and digital activity cycles",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,May 2018,2018,"The use of social media such as Twitter has changed our life routines. Previous studies have found consistent diurnal patterns of user activities on social media platforms. However, the temporal organization of human behavior is partly socially constructed and is determined by numerous factors other than the diurnal cycle. The current study argues that peer influence incurred by social networks is one of these potential factors. To test our hypotheses, we collected a random sample of active Twitter users (N = 5066), their followers and followees (N = 424,984), and all available tweets posted by these users. Results suggest that the temporal patterns between self-posting and interaction behavior differ across individuals. Users' daily activity rhythms are more similar to their followees rhythms than to their followers' rhythms. Despite the fact that the self-selection mechanism (homophily) cannot be ignored, peer influence seems to be an equally likely mechanism explaining such similarity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of timescale to consensus in voting dynamics with more than two options,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Apr 27 2018,2018,"We generalize a binary majority-vote model on adaptive networks to its plurality-vote counterpart and analyze the timescale to consensus when voters are given more than two options. When opinions are uniformly distributed in the population of voters in the initial state, we find that the timescale to consensus is shorter than the binary vote model from both numerical simulations and mathematical analysis using the master equation for the three-state plurality-vote model. When intervention such as opinion conversion is allowed, as in the case of sudden change of mind of voter for any reason, the effort needed to push the fragmented three-opinion population in the thermodynamic limit to the consensus state, measured in minimal intervention cost, is less than that needed to push a polarized two-opinion population to the consensus state, when the degree (p) of homophily is less than 0.8. For a finite system, the fragmented three-opinion population will spontaneously reach the consensus state, with faster time to consensus, compared to polarized two-opinion population, for a broad range of p.",
Academic performance and behavioral patterns,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,Apr 24 2018,2018,"Identifying the factors that influence academic performance is an essential part of educational research. Previous studies have documented the importance of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. Because most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small sample sizes, there is currently no quantification of the interplay of these factors. Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538 undergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of individual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators result in better model performance than individual characteristics (including both personality and class attendance). We confirm earlier findings that class attendance is the most important predictor among individual characteristics. Finally, our results suggest the presence of strong homophily and/or peer effects among university students.",
Network of families in a contemporary population: regional and cultural assortativity,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,Apr 18 2018,2018,"Using a large dataset with individual-level demographic information of almost 60,000 families in contemporary Finland, we analyse the regional variation and cultural assortativity by studying the network between families and the network between kins. For the network of families the largest connected component is found to consist of around 1000 families mostly originated from one single region in Western Finland. We characterize the networks in terms of the basic structural properties. In particular, we focus on the k-cores and the presence of transitive triangles. Clustering in the networks is found to result from homophily by language and religious affiliations. The large network fragments appear to be small-worlds. We also compare the fragments in the kin network with respect to the average coefficient of relationship. The measures of assortativity are able to distinguish the families in terms of their regions of origin. Overall, we distinguish between two patterns of regional effects, the 'metropolitan' and the 'cultural' pattern.",
Sexual Networks of Racially Diverse Young MSM Differ in Racial Homophily But Not Concurrency,JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES,Apr 15 2018,2018,"Background: Substantial racial disparities exist in HIV infection among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). However, evidence suggests black YMSM do not engage in greater levels of risk behavior. Sexual networks may help explain this paradox. This study used egocentric exponential random graph models to examine variation in concurrency (ie, 2 or more simultaneous partners) and homophily (ie, same race/ethnicity partners) across race/ethnicity groups in a diverse sample of YMSM.Methods: Data for this study come from a longitudinal cohort study of YMSM. Participants (n = 1012) provided data regarding their sexual contacts during the 6 months before their first study visit. A series of egocentric exponential random graph models examined how providing separate estimates for homophily and concurrency parameters across race/ethnicity improved the fit of these models. Networks were simulated using these parameters to examine how local network characteristics impact risk at the whole network level.Results: Results indicated that homophily, but not concurrency, varied across race/ethnicity. Black participants witnessed significantly higher race/ethnicity homophily compared with white and Latino peers. Extrapolating from these models, black individuals were more likely to be in a connected component with an HIV-positive individual and closer to HIV-positive individuals. However, white individuals were more likely to be in large connected components.Conclusions: These findings suggest that high racial homophily combined with existing disparities in HIV help perpetuate the spread of HIV among black YMSM. Nonetheless, additional work is required to understand these disparities given that homophily alone cannot sustain them indefinitely.",
A social model based on customers' profiles for analyzing the churning process in the mobile market of data plans,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Apr 15 2018,2018,"Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) present wireless services of the same kind in identical zones, clients select the service taking into account any element they consider relevant. Churning hits on the design of the network and the method to assign prices by MNOs, and of course their earnings. Therefore, MNOs try to reduce churn detecting potential churners before they leave the service. Our approach to churn prediction considers each customer individually. Previous research shows that members of the social circle of a subscriber may influence chum. Thus, many scenarios that describe social relations, and in which churning processes could be expected, set an emerging challenge with practical implications. This paper uses the Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) technique to model customers. The model's parameters include demographic and psychographic features as well as usage profiles according to their social behavior considering their customers' profiles. Our model modifies and extends an existing real social network generator algorithm that considers customer's profiles and homophily considerations to create connections. We show that using our approach, groups of customers with greater tendency to churn due to the influence of their social networks can be identified better. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Applying Social Network Analysis to Identify the Social Support Needs of Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients and Survivors,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT ONCOLOGY,Apr 2018,2018,"Purpose: This article examines how theoretical and clinical applications of social network analysis (SNA) can inform opportunities for innovation and advancement of social support programming for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients and survivors.Applications: SNA can help address potential barriers and challenges to initiating and sustaining AYA peer support by helping to identify the diverse psychosocial needs among individuals in the AYA age range; find strategic ways to support and connect AYAs at different phases of the cancer trajectory with resources and services; and increase awareness of psychosocial resources and referrals from healthcare providers. Network perspectives on homophily, proximity, and evolution provide a foundational basis to explore the utility of SNA in AYA clinical care and research initiatives. The uniqueness of the AYA oncology community can also provide insight into extending and developing current SNA theories.Implications: Using SNA in AYA psychosocial cancer research has the potential to create new ideas and pathways for supporting AYAs across the continuum of care, while also extending theories of SNA. SNA may also prove to be a useful tool for examining social support resources for AYAs with various chronic health conditions and other like groups.",
Exploiting User and Venue Characteristics for Fine-Grained Tweet Geolocation,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Apr 2018,2018,"Which venue is a tweet posted from? We call this a fine-grained geolocation problem. Given an observed tweet, the task is to infer its discrete posting venue, e.g., a specific restaurant. This recovers the venue context and differs from prior work, which geolocats tweets to location coordinates or cities/neighborhoods. First, we conduct empirical analysis to uncover venue and user characteristics for improving geolocation. For venues, we observe spatial homophily, in which venues near each other have more similar tweet content (i.e., text representations) compared to venues further apart. For users, we observe that they are spatially focused and more likely to visit venues near their previous visits. We also find that a substantial proportion of users post one or more geocoded tweet(s), thus providing their location history data. We then propose geolocation models that exploit spatial homophily and spatial focus characteristics plus posting time information. Our models rank candidate venues of test tweets such that the actual posting venue is ranked high. To better tune model parameters, we introduce a learning-to-rank framework. Our best model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that tweets without any location-indicative words can be geolocated meaningfully as well.",
"Homophily, heterophily and the diversity of messages among decision-making individuals",ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,Apr 2018,2018,"To better understand the intriguing mechanisms behind cooperation among decision-making individuals, we study the simple yet appealing use of preplay communication or cheap talk in evolutionary games, when players are able to choose strategies based on whether an opponent sends the same message as they do. So when playing games, in addition to pure cooperation and defection, players have two new strategies in this setting: homophilic (respectively, heterophilic) cooperation which is to cooperate (respectively, defect) only with those who send the same message as they do. We reveal the intrinsic qualities of individuals playing the two strategies and show that under the replicator dynamics, homophilic cooperators engage in a battle of messages and will become dominated by whichever message is the most prevalent at the start, while populations of heterophilic cooperators exhibit a more harmonious behaviour, converging to a state of maximal diversity. Then we take Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) as the base of the cheap-talk game and show that the hostility of heterophilics to individuals with similar messages leaves no possibility for pure cooperators to survive in a population of the two, whereas the one-message dominance of homophilics allows for pure cooperators with the same tag as the dominant homophilics to coexist in the population, demonstrating that homophilics are more cooperative than heterophilics. Finally, we generalize an existing convergence result on population shares associated with weakly dominated strategies to a broadly applicable theorem and complete previous research on PD games with preplay communication by proving that the frequencies of all types of cooperators, i.e. pure, homophilic and heterophilic, converge to zero in the face of defectors. This implies homophily and heterophily cannot facilitate the long-term survival of cooperation in this setting, which urges studying cheap-talk games under other reproduction dynamics.",
Monophily in social networks introduces similarity among friends-of-friends,NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR,Apr 2018,2018,"The observation that individuals tend to be friends with people who are similar to themselves, commonly known as homophily, is a prominent feature of social networks. While homophily describes a bias in attribute preferences for similar others, it gives limited attention to variability. Here, we observe that attribute preferences can exhibit variation beyond what can be explained by homophily. We call this excess variation monophily to describe the presence of individuals with extreme preferences for a particular attribute possibly unrelated to their own attribute. We observe that monophily can induce a similarity among friends-of-friends without requiring any similarity among friends. To simulate homophily and monophily in synthetic networks, we propose an overdispersed extension of the classical stochastic block model. We use this model to demonstrate how homophily-based methods for predicting attributes on social networks based on friends (that is, 'the company you keep') are fundamentally different from monophily-based methods based on friends-of-friends (that is, 'the company you're kept in'). We place particular focus on predicting gender, where homophily can be weak or non-existent in practice. These findings offer an alternative perspective on network structure and prediction, complicating the already difficult task of protecting privacy on social networks.",
A Sampling Model of Social Judgment,PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW,Apr 2018,2018,"Studies of social judgments have demonstrated a number of diverse phenomena that were so far difficult to explain within a single theoretical framework. Prominent examples are false consensus and false uniqueness, as well as self-enhancement and self-depreciation. Here we show that these seemingly complex phenomena can be a product of an interplay between basic cognitive processes and the structure of social and task environments. We propose and test a new process model of social judgment, the social sampling model (SSM), which provides a parsimonious quantitative account of different types of social judgments. In the SSM, judgments about characteristics of broader social environments are based on sampling of social instances from memory, where instances receive activation if they belong to a target reference class and have a particular characteristic. These sampling processes interact with the properties of social and task environments, including homophily, shapes of frequency distributions, and question formats. For example, in line with the model's predictions we found that whether false consensus or false uniqueness will occur depends on the level of homophily in people's social circles and on the way questions are asked. The model also explains some previously unaccounted-for patterns of self-enhancement and self-depreciation. People seem to be well informed about many characteristics of their immediate social circles, which in turn influence how they evaluate broader social environments and their position within them.",
SELECTING FOR SIMILARITY: THE PRESENCE OF HOMOPHILY AMONG WEIGHT LOSS PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS,ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,Apr 2018,2018,,
Underrepresentation of Hispanics and Other Minorities in Clinical Trials: Recruiters' Perspectives,JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES,Apr 2018,2018,"Clinical trials and research studies often fail to recruit participants from the minorities, hampering the generalizability of results. In order to mitigate this problem, the present study investigated how race/ethnicity affects the process of recruiting people from racial and ethnic minority groups, by conducting 11 focus groups with professional recruiters. Several themes emerged, such as how to adapt to potential participants' language competency and literacy levels, the importance to engage in culturally appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication, and to establish a sense of homophily between recruiters and patients. In addition, recruiters pointed out possible solutions to accommodate socioeconomic concerns, to adapt to contextual factors-including immigration status-and ultimately to respond to potential participants' mistrust of medical research. These findings are discussed, and future recommendations are provided.",
Ethnic diversity and value sharing: A longitudinal social network perspective on interactive group processes,BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,Apr 2018,2018,"People often collaborate in groups that are increasingly diverse. As research predominantly investigated effects of diversity, the processes behind these effects remain understudied. We follow recent research that shows creating shared values is important for group functioning but seems hindered in high diversity groups - and use longitudinal social network analyses to study two interpersonal processes behind value sharing: creating relations between members or social bonding' (network tie formation and homophily) and sharing values - potentially through these relationships - or social norming' (network convergence and influence). We investigate these processes in small interactive groups with low and high ethnic diversity as they collaborate over time. In both low and high diversity groups, members showed social bonding and this creation of relations between members was not organized along ethnic lines. Low diversity groups also showed social norming: Members adjusted their relational values to others they liked and achievement values converged regardless of liking. In high diversity groups, however, there was no evidence for social norming. Thus, ethnic diversity seems to especially affect processes of social norming in groups, suggesting that targeted interventions should focus on facilitating social norming to stimulate value sharing in high diversity groups.",
Quantifying the propagation of distress and mental disorders in social networks,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Mar 22 2018,2018,"Heterogeneity of human beings leads to think and react differently to social phenomena. Awareness and homophily drive people to weigh interactions in social multiplex networks, influencing a potential contagion effect. To quantify the impact of heterogeneity on spreading dynamics, we propose a model of coevolution of social contagion and awareness, through the introduction of statistical estimators, in a weighted multiplex network. Multiplexity of networked individuals may trigger propagation enough to produce effects among vulnerable subjects experiencing distress, mental disorder, which represent some of the strongest predictors of suicidal behaviours. The exposure to suicide is emotionally harmful, since talking about it may give support or inadvertently promote it. To disclose the complex effect of the overlapping awareness on suicidal ideation spreading among disordered people, we also introduce a data-driven approach by integrating different types of data. Our modelling approach unveils the relationship between distress and mental disorders propagation and suicidal ideation spreading, shedding light on the role of awareness in a social network for suicide prevention. The proposed model is able to quantify the impact of overlapping awareness on suicidal ideation spreading and our findings demonstrate that it plays a dual role on contagion, either reinforcing or delaying the contagion outbreak.",
Collecting data from migrants in Ghana: Lessons learned using respondent-driven sampling,DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH,Mar 16 2018,2018,"BACKGROUNDPolicymakers and program implementers require high-quality data on migrants and migration in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC); however, a shortage of high-quality data exists in these settings. Sampling migrant populations requires better techniques. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) may be one such solution.OBJECTIVEUsing Ghana as a case study, the objectives of this paper are to: 1) assess RDS recruitment productivity, network size, and ties of internal migrants; 2) test for homophily; and 3) detail the successes of and challenges to implementing RDS in Ghana and how these lessons can be applied to migrant populations in other LMIC settings.METHODSThis study used RDS to sample 625 rural-urban female migrants working as market porters (kayayei) in Accra, Ghana.RESULTSThis study generated the most comprehensive data set on kayayei to date. Network size increases as participants become more educated and migrate more often to Accra. Ethnic group membership is an important determinant of recruitment, with certain groups preferring to recruit from within. Employing members of the kayayei population to collect data built crucial trust.CONCLUSIONSWhilst RDS is not a one-size-fits-all solution for sampling hard-to-reach migrants in LMIC, it can be a powerful tool to uncover and to recruit hard-to-reach migrant populations. In countries with multiple ethnolinguistic groups, recruiting a migrant population with greater ethnolinguistic overlap may facilitate quicker equilibrium.",
Building the science of research management: What can research management learn from education research?,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION,SPR 2018,2018,"Research management is an emerging field of study and its development is significant to the advancement of research enterprise. Developing the science of research management requires investigating social mechanisms involved in research management. Yet, studies on social mechanisms of research management is lacking in the literature. To address this gap, this paper proposes importing methodologies and theories from other social science disciplines to study the social mechanisms of research management and to build the science of research management. The paper first articulates what constitutes the science of research management, then proposes to appropriate Design-Based Research (DBR), a methodology in education research, for building the science of research management while at the same time strengthening the theory-practice nexus. A study of education research is then presented to illustrate how DBR is used to enact the theory of homophily which is imported from sociology. It reveals an opportunity to use social designs to develop social relationships among teachers from different schools for networked learning. Such a research endeavour also has potential to advance theories of relationship-building in sociology. Inferring from the example as an analogue to what is suggested for research management, the paper advocates a way to reciprocally connect research management as an emerging research field with more established social science disciplines at large and to advance both the theory and practice of research management.",
The Role of Whites in Lay Leadership Within Latino Churches,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,Mar 2018,2018,"Latinos are the largest ethnoracial minority group in America, and Latino congregations play an important role in the lives of their members and communities. Yet, little research exists on these congregations. The current study provides an examination of the lay leadership structures and power dynamics within Latino congregations. Drawing from organizational ecology theory and the homophily principle as well as contemporary racial stratification literature, we propose competing hypotheses regarding the roles whites play within the lay leadership and power structures of Latino congregations. Utilizing a national multilevel data set, we find the persistence of white privilege existing within Latino congregations, as whites are more likely to hold lay leadership positions within these congregations than Latinos, despite their numeric minority status. Moreover, our results reveal that individual access to the decision-making process in these congregations increases for both whites and multiracial individuals as the proportion of Latinos increases in their congregation. We further discuss the implications of these findings.",
The social networks and distinctive experiences of intensively involved online garners: A novel mixed methods approach,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Mar 2018,2018,"Relying on a novel integration of both survey data (N = 3629) and egocentric social network interviews (N = 53), this study explores associations between patterns of social support and online gaming involvement and experience. In both our large survey and network interviews, informants who possess a greater number of ""alters"" (social ties) who support their gaming are more likely to report deriving pleasure from their online play. We also find that intensive or ""hardcore"" gamers show evidence of ""homophily,"" with such players having a greater number of gamer-alters in their ""important person"" social networks and thus a more homogenous social composition. Importantly, more intensively involved gamers' social networks also tend to be less dense and more fragmented. Interpreting the results, we argue that network consensus of social norms may compel garners to both behave and judge their behavior in certain distinctive positive and negative ways. At the same time, garners may also construct different types of networks by surrounding themselves with more supportive and like-minded alters. The employment of an ethnographically derived, mixed methodology allows us to go beyond more standard approaches that often rely on survey data alone. Our method lets us test social network theory hypotheses within gaming-related offline/online networks, ascertaining possible causal processes underlying links between social support and online gaming involvement and experience.

The influence of eWOM communications: An application of online social network framework,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Mar 2018,2018,"Drawing on Online Social Network (OSN) Framework (Brown, Boderick, & Lee, 2007), this study examines the role of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in consumer review websites by investigating its effects on the decision-making process of consumers. OSN framework postulates that individuals consider the websites to be primary ""actors"" and develop social relationships with the websites themselves rather than the other online participants. This study proposes and empirically tests an integrative model of three social network constructs associated with the website (i.e., tie strength, homophily, and source credibility) and their relationship to consumers' evaluations associated with attitudes and perceived influence of eWOM effectiveness. An online survey with a sample size of 793 respondents revealed that the homophily and tie strength between a website and a consumer are important drivers of source credibility, which in turn influence attitude toward the reviews as well as the website. The attitudes formed through the perceptions of tie-strength, homophily and source credibility ultimately determines the influence of eWOM consumers' purchase decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Mining user interests over active topics on social networks,INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT,Mar 2018,2018,"Inferring users' interests from their activities on social networks has been an emerging research topic in the recent years. Most existing approaches heavily rely on the explicit contributions (posts) of a user and overlook users' implicit interests, i.e., those potential user interests that the user did not explicitly mention but might have interest in. Given a set of active topics present in a social network in a specified time interval, our goal is to build an interest profile for a user over these topics by considering both explicit and implicit interests of the user. The reason for this is that the interests of free-riders and cold start users who constitute a large majority of social network users, cannot be directly identified from their explicit contributions to the social network. Specifically, to infer users' implicit interests, we propose a graph-based link prediction schema that operates over a representation model consisting of three types of information: user explicit contributions to topics, relationships between users, and the relatedness between topics. Through extensive experiments on different variants of our representation model and considering both homogeneous and heterogeneous link prediction, we investigate how topic relatedness and users' homophily relation impact the quality of inferring users' implicit interests. Comparison with state-of-the-art baselines on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in inferring users' interests in terms of perplexity and in the context of retweet prediction application. Moreover, we further show that the impact of our work is especially meaningful when considered in case of free-riders and cold start users.",
Consumer Responses to For-Profit Firms Exercising Religious Freedom in the Marketplace,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING,SPR 2018,2018,"Two judgments are at the heart of the controversy surrounding state-level religious freedom legislation and for-profit firms. For some, firms choosing to limit product/service access due to the owner's religious beliefs are viewed as appropriately asserting their First Amendment rights to religious freedom. Others posit that such laws legalize discrimination. The authors offer a theory in which homophily mediates consumers' perceptions of a firm that chooses to exercise its religious convictions in the for-profit market, and an orthodox worldview moderates this relationship. When these practices are perceived to be discriminatory, there is a strong negative effect on behavior intentions; however, perceptions that the firm is appropriately asserting religious freedoms are unlikely to increase customer traffic. The authors examine the policy implications from these investigations for states and local municipalities.",
Do Political Similarities Facilitate Interlocal Collaboration?,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW,MAR-APR 2018,2018,"This research examines the extent to which political similarities-that is, homophily between political actors at the local level-affect patterns of interorganizational collaboration in an emergency response situation. While the field of emergency management has focused on implementation-oriented arrangements among key stakeholders, few studies have systemically investigated the creation and development of interorganizational collaborations led by political actors, especially following catastrophic events. The analysis reveals that a dyadic tie with political homophily boosts local responders' ties with other agencies during emergencies. Findings indicate that political solidarity, formulated by chief elected officials of municipalities and council members, can broaden the scope of interorganizational collaboration by mitigating institutional collective action problems at the local level. This research presents a critical recommendation for emergency managers that interlocal collaboration for timely response to a disaster is attributable to political similarities that facilitate frequent interlocal interactions through formal and/or informal agreements.",
The Evolution of Influence Through Endogenous Link Formation,MARKETING SCIENCE,MAR-APR 2018,2018,"Marketing researchers and practitioners are interested in targeting individuals in social networks who may have disproportionately higher levels of influence over others in their network. While the extant literature suggests individual characteristics or network position as proxies for relative influence, our study bridges these two streams by investigating the endogenous acquisition of network position as a function of exogenous individual characteristics. Specifically, do those with higher expertise achieve higher influence when people endogenously choose those to whom they listen? Using an agent-based modeling simulation framework, we model the dynamics of two types of individuals, i.e., independents with exogenous information and imitators. Over the course of multiple diffusions, agents choose whom to ""listen to"" for information; dropping less useful ties and adding new ones. We find that independents can have less influence (out-degree) than imitators who collect information from multiple sources. Furthermore, this effect is exacerbated by homophily. Noise in communication channels, on the other hand, moderates these effects, yet can increase penetration rates. We show that our results are robust to alternative dynamic network structures. Our research suggests that marketers should consider the environment, community characteristics, communication medium, and product domains when assessing the relative influence of individuals.",
Organisational Information and Knowledge Sharing: Uncovering Mediating Effects of Perceived Trustworthiness Using the PROCESS Approach,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,Mar 2018,2018,"Many organisations are confronted with challenges in getting employees to effectively participate in information and knowledge sharing (IKS). Further, IKS is embedded in multifaceted social contexts, which are influenced by several different social and cognitive factors. This study is in support of the hypothesis that perceived trustworthiness is widely implicated as a mediating factor between those social-cognitive factors and IKS. Previous work, however, uncovered only a handful of such mediating effects. It is argued here that the paucity may have been due to limitations of the statistical methods. This study employs PROCESS, a more powerful current method for mediation analysis in an attempt to uncover previously hidden relationships. Analyses were performed on data collected from 275 knowledge workers (legal professionals and paralegals) engaged in shared legal project work, at one of Canadas largest multijurisdictional law firms. Social-cognitive factors that were considered were shared language, shared vision, tie strength, age/gender/educational homophily and relationship length. IKS outcomes were willingness to share, willingness to use and perceived receipt of useful information/knowledge. Consistent with the hypothesis, the more powerful method revealed a large number of significant mediating effects of perceived trustworthiness. Out of possible 112 simple mediation models, 62 were significant, 44 of which had been previously undiscovered. The results highlight the importance of trust as well as the power of current methods for mediation analysis and serve as a strong argument for their use. The paper concludes with implications for research and practice.",
On the optimal diversification of social networks in frictional labour markets with occupational mismatch,LABOUR ECONOMICS,Mar 2018,2018,"This paper incorporates social networks into a frictional labour market framework. There are two worker types and two occupations, which are subject to correlated fluctuations in output. The equilibrium is characterized by occupational mismatch which is associated with a wage penalty. Every worker has a fixed number of social contacts in the network. The fraction of contacts of the same occupational type defines homophily of the social network, so this paper investigates the optimal level of network homophily. Workers are risk-neutral and take aggregate variables as given, so their optimal individual choice is full homophily. This is different from the social planner's perspective. The planner internalizes external effects of workers' network choices on aggregate variables, so there exists a unique interior value of network homophily maximizing the present value of income. On the one hand, higher homophily is associated with lower occupational mismatch. But on the other hand, higher homophily separates the two groups of workers, prevents exchange of information about open vacancies, and leads to more unemployment, especially in recessions. So it is the trade-off between these two effects and not the desire to reduce income volatility, as in standard portfolio theory, which gives rise to network diversification. Comparative statics shows that optimal network homophily is lower and diversification is stronger with a lower wage penalty from mismatch, lower unemployment benefit and negative correlation in output fluctuations.

Discovering Canonical Correlations between Topical and Topological Information in Document Networks,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING,Mar 1 2018,2018,"Document network is a kind of intriguing dataset which can provide both topical (textual content) and topological (relational link) information. A key point in modeling such datasets is to discover proper denominators beneath the text and link. Most previous work introduces the assumption that documents closely linked with each other share common latent topics. However, the heterophily (i.e., tendency to link to different others) of nodes is neglected, which is pervasive in social networks. In this paper, we simultaneously incorporate community detection and topic modeling in a unified framework, and appeal to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to capture the latent semantic correlations between the two heterogeneous factors, community and topic. Despite of the homophily (i.e., tendency to link to similar others) or heterophily, CCA can properly capture the inherent correlations which fit the dataset itself without any prior hypothesis. We also impose auxiliary word embeddings to improve the quality of topics. The effectiveness of our proposed model is comprehensively verified on three different types of datasets which are hyperlinked networks of web pages, social networks of friends, and coauthor networks of publications. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements compared with the current state of the art.",
"How does agency workforce diversity influence Federal R&D funding of minority and women technology entrepreneurs? An analysis of the SBIR and STTR programs, 2001-2011",SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS,Mar 2018,2018,"US Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs provide Federal research and development (R&D) grants to technology ventures. We explore how grantor demographic diversity explains why demographically diverse grantees experience different odds for successfully transitioning from initial to follow-on R&D grants. We empirically analyze 52,126 Phase I SBIR/STTR awards granted by 11 Federal agencies (2001-2011). We find a positive association between agency workforce diversity and Phase II funding for Phase I grantees, but minority and women technology entrepreneurs are less likely to receive this funding than their non-minority and male counterparts. Agencies valuing workforce ethnic diversity or leveraging gender homophily positively influence the likelihood of women technology entrepreneurs obtaining Phase II funding. We discuss evidence-based implications for policy and practice.",
Enhancing recommendation on extremely sparse data with blocks-coupled non-negative matrix factorization,NEUROCOMPUTING,Feb 22 2018,2018,"Recommender systems have been comprehensively analyzed in the past decade and made great achievement in various fields. Generally speaking, the recommendation of information of interests is based on the potential connections among users and items implied in 'User-Item Matrix'. However, the existing algorithm for recommendation will be degraded and ever fail in the case of sparseness of matrix. To resolve this problem, a new algorithm called B-NMF (blocks-coupled non-negative matrix factorization) is proposed in this paper. With this algorithm: (1) the reconstruction performance of matrix of extreme sparseness is improved as a result of blocking the matrix and modeling based on full use of the coupling between blocks; (2) the coupling between different blocks is ensured via a coupling mechanism that imposes constraints on consistency as the matrix is decomposed. In addition, we provide an approach to exploiting homophily effect in prediction via homophily regularization and thus, the coupling between blocks is improved via extra homophily regularization constraints. Experiment results show that our solution is superior to the existing ones in dealing with the problem of extremely sparse matrix. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Social structure modulates the evolutionary consequences of social plasticity: A social network perspective on interacting phenotypes,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Feb 2018,2018,"Organisms express phenotypic plasticity during social interactions. Interacting phenotype theory has explored the consequences of social plasticity for evolution, but it is unclear how this theory applies to complex social structures. We adapt interacting phenotype models to general social structures to explore how the number of social connections between individuals and preference for phenotypically similar social partners affect phenotypic variation and evolution. We derive an analytical model that ignores phenotypic feedback and use simulations to test the predictions of this model. We find that adapting previous models to more general social structures does not alter their general conclusions but generates insights into the effect of social plasticity and social structure on the maintenance of phenotypic variation and evolution. Contribution of indirect genetic effects to phenotypic variance is highest when interactions occur at intermediate densities and decrease at higher densities, when individuals approach interacting with all group members, homogenizing the social environment across individuals. However, evolutionary response to selection tends to increase at greater network densities as the effects of an individual's genes are amplified through increasing effects on other group members. Preferential associations among similar individuals (homophily) increase both phenotypic variance within groups and evolutionary response to selection. Our results represent a first step in relating social network structure to the expression of social plasticity and evolutionary responses to selection.",
Modelling Transition Phenomena of Scientific Coauthorship Networks,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Feb 2018,2018,"In a range of scientific coauthorship networks, transitions emerge in degree distribution, in the correlation between degree and local clustering coefficient, etc. The existence of those transitions could be regarded because of the diversity in collaboration behaviors of scientific fields. A growing geometric hypergraph built on a cluster of concentric circles is proposed to model two specific collaboration behaviors, namely the behaviors of research team leaders and those of the other team members. The model successfully predicts the transitions, as well as many common features of coauthorship networks. Particularly, it realizes a process of deriving the complex scale-free property from the simple yes/no decisions. Moreover, it provides a reasonable explanation for the emergence of transitions with the difference of collaboration behaviors between leaders and other members. The difference emerges in the evolution of research teams, which synthetically addresses several specific factors of generating collaborations, namely the communications between research teams, academic impacts and homophily of authors.",
Mixing and diffusion in a two-type population,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,Feb 2018,2018,"The outbreak of epidemics, the rise of religious radicalization or the motivational influence of fellow students in classrooms are some of the issues that can be described as diffusion processes in heterogeneous groups. Understanding the role that interaction patterns between groups (e.g. homophily or segregation) play in the diffusion of certain traits or behaviours is a major challenge for contemporary societies. Here, we study the impact on diffusion processes of mixing (or, alternatively, segregating) two groups that present different sensitivities or propensities to contagion. We find non-monotonic effects of mixing and inefficient segregation levels, i.e. situations where a change in the mixing level can benefit both groups, e.g. where an increase in the mixing level can reduce the expected contagion levels in both groups. These findings can have fundamental consequences for the design of inclusion policies.",
Dynamic Pricing in Social Networks: The Word-of-Mouth Effect,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Feb 2018,2018,"We study the problem of optimal dynamic pricing for a monopolist selling a product to consumers in a social network. In the proposed model, the only means of spread of information about the product is via word-of-mouth communication; consumers' knowledge of the product is only through friends who already know about the product's existence. Both buyers and nonbuyers contribute to information diffusion, while buyers are more likely to spread the news about the product. By analyzing the structure of the underlying endogenous dynamic process, we show that the optimal dynamic pricing policy for durable products with zero or negligible marginal cost drops the price to zero infinitely often. The firm uses free offers to attract low-valuation agents and to get them more engaged in the spread. As a result, the firm can reach potential high-valuation consumers in parts of the network that would otherwise remain untouched without the price drops. We provide evidence for this behavior from the smartphone app market, where price histories indicate frequent zero-price sales. Moreover, we show that despite dropping the price to zero infinitely often, the optimal price trajectory does not get trapped near zero. We demonstrate the validity of our results in the face of forward-looking consumers and homophily in word-of-mouth engagement. We further unravel the key role of the product type in the optimality of zero-price sales by showing that the price fluctuations disappear after a finite time for a nondurable product.",
Adaptive Knowledge Propagation in Web Ontologies,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB,Feb 2018,2018,"We focus on the problem of predicting missing assertions in Web ontologies. We start from the assumption that individual resources that are similar in some aspects are more likely to be linked by specific relations: this phenomenon is also referred to as homophily and emerges in a variety of relational domains. In this article, we propose a method for (1) identifying which relations in the ontology are more likely to link similar individuals and (2) efficiently propagating knowledge across chains of similar individuals. By enforcing sparsity in the model parameters, the proposed method is able to select only the most relevant relations for a given prediction task. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the literature.",
The interplay of cultural intolerance and action-assortativity for the emergence of cooperation and homophily,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,Feb 2018,2018,"This paper investigates the emergence of cooperation in a heterogeneous population that is divided into two cultural groups. Agents are randomly matched in pairs to engage in a prisoner dilemma. The matching process is assortative in actions, that is, cooperators are more likely to be matched with cooperators, defectors are more likely to be matched with defectors. Agents exhibit a form of cultural intolerance: when two agents of different cultures are matched, they suffer a cost due to their cultural differences. We find that when cultural intolerance is sufficiently strong, homophily emerges together with perfect correlation between culture and behavior: all agents from one cultural group cooperate, while all agents from the other cultural group defect, and interactions among agents within the same cultural group are more frequent. The relation between cultural intolerance and societal welfare is non-monotonic. In particular, stronger cultural intolerance can increase cooperation when action-assortativity is weak, while it can increase defection when action-assortativity is strong. Moreover, everyone cooperating does not necessarily maximize total welfare unless cultural intolerance can be made sufficiently weak. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Forecasting Changes in Religiosity and Existential Security with an Agent-based Model,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Jan 31 2018,2018,"We employ existing data sets and agent-based modeling to forecast changes in religiosity and existential security among a collective of individuals overtime. Existential security reflects the extent of economic, socioeconomic and human development provided by society. Our model includes agents in social networks interacting with one another based on the education level of the agents, the religious practices of the agents, and each agent's existential security within their natural and social environments. The data used to inform the values and relationships among these variables is based on rigorous statistical analysis of the International Social Survey Programme Religion Module (ISSP) and the Human Development Report (HDR). We conduct an evaluation that demonstrates, for the countries and time periods studied, that our model provides a more accurate forecast of changes in existential security and religiosity than two alternative approaches. The improved accuracy is largely due to the inclusion of social networks with educational homophily which alters the way in which religiosity and existential security change in the model. These dynamics grow societies where two individuals with the same initial religious practices (or belief In God, or supernatural beliefs) evolve differently based on the educational backgrounds of the individuals with which they surround themselves. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our model and provide direction for future work.",
Similar neural responses predict friendship,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Jan 30 2018,2018,"Human social networks are overwhelmingly homophilous: individuals tend to befriend others who are similar to them in terms of a range of physical attributes (e.g., age, gender). Do similarities among friends reflect deeper similarities in how we perceive, interpret, and respond to the world? To test whether friendship, and more generally, social network proximity, is associated with increased similarity of real-time mental responding, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan subjects' brains during free viewing of naturalistic movies. Here we show evidence for neural homophily: neural responses when viewing audiovisual movies are exceptionally similar among friends, and that similarity decreases with increasing distance in a real-world social network. These results suggest that we are exceptionally similar to our friends in how we perceive and respond to the world around us, which has implications for interpersonal influence and attraction.",
Multi-granularity Network Representation Learning Based on Game Theory,2018 18TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING WORKSHOPS (ICDMW),2018,2018,"The study of embedding large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces has been going on for several years. However, current feature learning methods are not sufficient to simultaneously capture the structural identity and homophily of nodes in the network. We propose Multi-granularity Network Representation Learning (MGNRL), a novel and flexible framework to learn the latent representations of nodes. Firstly, nodes are divided into different granular layers according to their importance by MGNRL, and the neighborhood structures of nodes are considered to encode their similarities. Then a random walk procedure is designed to explore nodes on different granularity layers, and the public goods game theory is introduced to adjust the probability of random walk continuously. MGNRL overcomes the limitations of existing methods by simultaneously capturing the structural identity and homophily of network nodes. Experiments show that MGNRL performs well in many tasks such as visualization, node classification and link prediction.",
Gerrymandering Over Graphs,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS (AAMAS' 18),2018,2018,"In many real-life scenarios, voting problems consist of several phases: an overall set of voters is partitioned into subgroups, each subgroup chooses a preferred candidate, and the final winner is selected from among those candidates. The attempt to skew the outcome of such a voting system through strategic partitioning of the overall set of voters into subgroups is known as ""gerrymandering"".We investigate the problem of gerrymandering over a network structure; the voters are embedded in a social network, and the task is to divide the network into connected components such that a target candidate will win in a plurality of the components. We first show that the problem is NP-complete in the worst case. We then perform a series of simulations, using random graph models incorporating a homophily factor. In these simulations, we show that a simple greedy algorithm can be quite successful in finding a partition in favor of a specific candidate.",
On Collusion and Coercion: Agent Interconnectedness and In-Group Behaviour,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS (AAMAS' 18),2018,2018,"The interconnectedness of actors is an antecedent for collective corruption, which in turn can lead to endemic corruption in a society. As a testbed for studying the effects of social interconnectedness on corrupt behaviours, we examine the domain of maritime customs. We add to our existing agent-based simulation a nuanced model of actor relatedness, consisting of clan, in-group (sect), and place of origin, and encode associated behavioural norms. We examine in simulation the effects of social interconnectedness on domain performance metrics such as container outcomes, delay, revenue, collusion, and coercive demands. Results confirm that, when corruption is widespread, localized punitive- or incentive-based policies are weakened, and that the effect of process re-engineering is frustrated when interconnectedness increases beyond a critical point, for two out of three forms of homophily connections. Our work connects with and provides a complementary methodology to works in the political economy literature.",
Resegregation in Desegregated Schools? Ethnic Boundary Making between Students in Everyday School Life,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE DER ERZIEHUNG UND SOZIALISATION,2018,2018,"The paper examines ethnic boundary-making between students and asks whether there are processes of ethnic resegregation within desegregated schools. The focus is on a specific version of segregation research, which investigates students' seating preferences in the cafeteria. Theoretically, based on the ethnic boundary making approach, homophilic preferences (attraction to similar others) along ethno-national, ethno-religious, and ethno-linguistic lines, which manifest themselves in segregated seating patterns, are expected. Segregation processes between 746 children and adolescents in 32 classes and two schools are captured by use of ""naturalistic observation"", a method, which allows to unveil the product of a behavioural dimension of boundary-making. The empirical findings show that indeed ethnic resegregation takes place within desegregated schools. The segregation patterns can be attributed to both individual preferences and institutional closure.",
Semiparametric Analysis of Network Formation,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS,2018,2018,"We consider a statistical model for directed network formation that features both node-specific parameters that capture degree heterogeneity and common parameters that reflect homophily among nodes. The goal is to perform statistical inference on the homophily parameters while treating the node-specific parameters as fixed effects. Jointly estimating all parameters leads to incidental-parameter bias and incorrect inference. As an alternative, we develop an approach based on a sufficient statistic that separates inference on the homophily parameters from estimation of the fixed effects. The estimator is easy to compute and can be applied to both dense and sparse networks, and is shown to have desirable asymptotic properties under sequences of growing networks. We illustrate the improvements of this estimator over maximum likelihood and bias-corrected estimation in a series of numerical experiments. The technique is applied to explain the import and export patterns in a dense network of countries and to estimate a more sparse advice network among attorneys in a corporate law firm.",
A unified framework for link prediction based on non-negative matrix factorization with coupling multivariate information,Figshare,2019-01-31,2018,"Many link prediction methods have been developed to infer unobserved links or predict missing links based on the observed network structure that is always incomplete and subject to interfering noise. Thus, the performance of existing methods is usually limited in that their computation depends only on input graph structures, and they do not consider external information. The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structure and node attribute information should help to resolve the task of link prediction. This work proposes SASNMF, a link prediction unified framework based on non-negative matrix factorization that considers not only graph structure but also the internal and external auxiliary information, which refers to both the node attributes and the structural latent feature information extracted from the network. Furthermore, three different combinations of internal and external information are proposed and input into the framework to solve the link prediction problem. Extensive experimental results on thirteen real networks, five node attribute networks and eight non-attribute networks show that the proposed framework has competitive performance compared with benchmark methods and state-of-the-art methods, indicating the superiority of the presented algorithm.

GRAPH-BASED DEEP-TREE RECURSIVE NEURAL NETWORK (DTRNN) FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION,2018 IEEE WORKSHOP ON SPOKEN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY (SLT 2018),2018,2018,"A novel graph-to-tree conversion mechanism called the deep-tree generation (DTG) algorithm is first proposed to predict text data represented by graphs. The DTG method can generate a richer and more accurate representation for nodes (or vertices) in graphs. It adds flexibility in exploring the vertex neighborhood information to better reflect the second order proximity and homophily equivalence in a graph. Then, a Deep-Tree Recursive Neural Network (DTRNN) method is presented and used to classify vertices that contains text data in graphs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTRNN method, we apply it to three real-world graph datasets and show that the DTRNN method outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarking methods.",
Information-theoretic Limits for Community Detection in Network Models,ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 31 (NIPS 2018),2018,2018,"We analyze the information-theoretic limits for the recovery of node labels in several network models. This includes the Stochastic Block Model, the Exponential Random Graph Model, the Latent Space Model, the Directed Preferential Attachment Model, and the Directed Small-world Model. For the Stochastic Block Model, the non-recoverability condition depends on the probabilities of having edges inside a community, and between different communities. For the Latent Space Model, the non-recoverability condition depends on the dimension of the latent space, and how far and spread are the communities in the latent space. For the Directed Preferential Attachment Model and the Directed Small-world Model, the non-recoverability condition depends on the ratio between homophily and neighborhood size. We also consider dynamic versions of the Stochastic Block Model and the Latent Space Model.",
RaRE: Social Rank Regulated Large-scale Network Embedding,WEB CONFERENCE 2018: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW2018),2018,2018,"Network embedding algorithms that map nodes in a network into a low-dimensional vector space are prevalent in recent years, due to their superior performance in many network-based tasks, such as clustering, classification, and link prediction. The main assumption of existing algorithms is that the learned latent representation for nodes should preserve the structure of the network, in terms of first-order or higher-order connectivity. In other words, nodes that are more similar will have higher probability to connect to each other. This phenomena is typically explained as homophily in network science. However, there is another factor usually neglected by the existing embedding algorithms, which is the popularity of a node. For example, celebrities in a social network usually receive numerous followers, which cannot be fully explained by the similarity of the two users. We denote this factor with the terminology ""social rank"". We then propose a network embedding model that considers both of the two factors in link generation, and learn proximity-based embedding and social rank-based embedding separately. Rather than simply treating these two factors independent with each other, a carefully designed link generation model is proposed, which explicitly models the interdependency between these two types of embeddings. Experiments on several real-world datasets across different domains demonstrate the superiority of our novel network embedding model over the state-of-the-art methods.",
"Me, My Echo Chamber, and I: Introspection on Social Media Polarization",WEB CONFERENCE 2018: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW2018),2018,2018,"Homophily - our tendency to surround ourselves with others who share our perspectives and opinions about the world is both a part of human nature and an organizing principle underpinning many of our digital social networks. However, when it comes to politics or culture, homophily can amplify tribal mindsets and produce ""echo chambers"" that degrade the quality, safety, and diversity of discourse online. While several studies have empirically proven this point, few have explored how making users aware of the extent and nature of their political echo chambers influences their subsequent beliefs and actions. In this paper, we introduce Social Mirror, a social network visualization tool that enables a sample of Twitter users to explore the politically-active parts of their social network. We use Social Mirror to recruit Twitter users with a prior history of political discourse to a randomized experiment where we evaluate the effects of different treatments on participants' i) beliefs about their network connections, ii) the political diversity of who they choose to follow, and iii) the political alignment of the URLs they choose to share. While we see no effects on average political alignment of shared URLs, we find that recommending accounts of the opposite political ideology to follow reduces participants' beliefs in the political homogeneity of their network connections but still enhances their connection diversity one week after treatment. Conversely, participants who enhance their belief in the political homogeneity of their Twitter connections have less diverse network connections 2-3 weeks after treatment. We explore the implications of these disconnects between beliefs and actions on future efforts to promote healthier exchanges in our digital public spheres.",
Algorithmic Glass Ceiling in Social Networks,WEB CONFERENCE 2018: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW2018),2018,2018,"As social recommendations such as friend suggestions and people to follow become increasingly popular and influential on the growth of social media, we find that prominent social recommendation algorithms can exacerbate the under-representation of certain demographic groups at the top of the social hierarchy. To study this imbalance in online equal opportunities, we leverage new Instagram data and offer for the first time an analysis that studies the effect of gender, homophily and growth dynamics under social recommendations. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the existence of an algorithmic glass ceiling that exhibits all the properties of the metaphorical social barrier that hinders groups like women or people of color from attaining equal representation. What raises concern is that our proof shows that under fixed minority and homophily parameters the algorithmic effect is systematically larger than the glass ceiling generated by the spontaneous growth of social networks. We discuss ways to address this concern in future design.",
Socioeconomic Dependencies of Linguistic Patterns in Twitter: A Multivariate Analysis,WEB CONFERENCE 2018: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW2018),2018,2018,"Our usage of language is not solely reliant on cognition but is arguably determined by myriad external factors leading to a global variability of linguistic patterns. This issue, which lies at the core of sociolinguistics and is backed by many small-scale studies on face-to-face communication, is addressed here by constructing a dataset combining the largest French Twitter corpus to date with detailed socioeconomic maps obtained from national census in France. We show how key linguistic variables measured in individual Twitter streams depend on factors like socioeconomic status, location, time, and the social network of individuals. We found that (i) people of higher socioeconomic status, active to a greater degree during the daytime, use a more standard language; (ii) the southern part of the country is more prone to use more standard language than the northern one, while locally the used variety or dialect is determined by the spatial distribution of socioeconomic status; and (iii) individuals connected in the social network are closer linguistically than disconnected ones, even after the effects of status homophily have been removed. Our results inform sociolinguistic theory and may inspire novel learning methods for the inference of socioeconomic status of people from the way they tweet.",
"Same feathers, different flocks: Breaking down the meaning of 'behavioral Homophily' in the etiology of crime",JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,JAN-FEB 2018,2018,"Purpose: This study's purpose is to (1) examine how behavioral homophily relates to deviance among friendship pairs and (2) to assess how deviance and non-deviance homophily may be independently and jointly important for deviant behavior.Methods: Using a sample of 2154 individuals nested within 1077 dyadic friendship pairs, a series of mixed effects models explore how behavioral, deviance, and non-deviance homophily at the dyadic level relate to an actor's theft, vandalism, violence, drug, and alcohol use.Results: Findings demonstrate that behavioral homophily is a more robust protective factor than risk factor for deviance. Specifically, non-deviance homophily is significantly more related to abstaining from offending than deviance homophily is in promoting offending for theft, vandalism, violence, and drug use. And while behavioral homophily was not significantly associated with alcohol use, deviance homophily related to higher levels of alcohol use and non-deviance homophily related to less alcohol use with relatively equal effect sizes.Conclusions: Behavioral homophily contains two empirically and theoretically distinct components deviance and non-deviance homophily. While both criminological theory and research have long established that peers ""matter,"" behavioral homophily across friendships can operate in a bifurcated role by associating with offending while simultaneously relating to normative behavior.",

PACELA: A Neural Framework for User Visitation in Location-based Social Networks,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH CONFERENCE ON USER MODELING, ADAPTATION AND PERSONALIZATION (UMAP'18)",2018,2018,"Check-in prediction using location-based social network data is an important research problem for both academia and industry since an accurate check-in predictive model is useful to many applications, e.g. urban planning, venue recommendation, route suggestion, and context-aware advertising. Intuitively, when considering venues to visit, users may rely on their past observed visit histories as well as some latent attributes associated with the venues. In this paper, we therefore propose a check-in prediction model based on a neural framework called Preference and Context Embeddings with Latent Attributes (PACELA). PACELA learns the embeddings space for the user and venue data as well as the latent attributes of both users and venues. More specifically, we use a probabilistic matrix factorization-based technique to infer the latent attributes specific to users and locations in location-based social networks (LBSNs), considering the user visitation decisions that could be affected by area attraction, neighborhood competition, and social homophily. PACELA also includes a deep learning neural network to combine both embedding and latent features to predict if a user performs check-in on a location. Our experiments on three different real world datasets show that PACELA yields the best check-in prediction accuracy against several baseline methods.",

Estimating Causal Effects On Social Networks,2018 IEEE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS (DSAA),2018,2018,"In most real-world systems units are interconnected and can be represented as networks consisting of nodes and edges. For instance, in social systems individuals can have social ties, family or financial relationships. In settings where some units are exposed to a treatment and its effects spills over connected units, estimating both the direct effect of the treatment and spillover effects presents several challenges. First, assumptions on the way and the extent to which spillover effects occur along the observed network are required. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment is not under the control of the investigator, confounding and homophily are potential threats to the identification and estimation of causal effects on networks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: i) neighborhood interference, which assumes interference to operate only through a function of the the immediate neighbors' treatments, ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and neighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding variables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we develop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for treatment and spillover effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. Adjustment for propensity score is performed using a penalized spline regression. Inference capitalizes on a three-step Bayesian procedure which allows taking into account the uncertainty in the propensity score estimation and avoiding model feedback. Finally, correlation of interacting units is taken into account using a community detection algorithm and incorporating random effects in the outcome model. All these sources of variability, including variability of treatment assignment, are accounted for in the posterior distribution of finite-sample causal estimands.",
Peer effects on adolescent smoking: Are popular teens more influential?,Figshare,2018-12-05,2018,"Previous research on adolescent cigarette adoption has focused on peer influence and the perceived status gain from smoking but has ignored the status effects on peer influence. We analyze adolescent peer effects on cigarette consumption while considering the popularity of peers. The analysis is based on a four wave panel survey representative of American high school students. We measure peers popularity by their eigenvector centrality in high school social networks. Using lagged peers behavior, school fixed effects, and instrumental variables to control for homophily and contextual confounds, we find that the probability of smoking the following year increases with the mean popularity of smokers, while the popularity of non-smokers has the opposite effect. These effects persist seven and fourteen years later (wave 3 and 4 of the data). In addition, the probability of smoking increases with the smoking propensity of the 20% most popular teens and decreases with the smoking propensity of the bottom 80%. The results indicate the importance of knowing not only the smoking propensity within a school but also the location of smokers within the social hierarchy. Copyright: CC BY 4.0",
Statistical Inference in a Directed Network Model With Covariates,Figshare,2018-12-05,2018,"Networks are often characterized by node heterogeneity for which nodes exhibit different degrees of interaction and link homophily for which nodes sharing common features tend to associate with each other. In this article, we rigorously study a directed network model that captures the former via node-specific parameterization and the latter by incorporating covariates. In particular, this model quantifies the extent of heterogeneity in terms of outgoingness and incomingness of each node by different parameters, thus allowing the number of heterogeneity parameters to be twice the number of nodes. We study the maximum likelihood estimation of the model and establish the uniform consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. Numerical studies demonstrate our theoretical findings and two data analyses confirm the usefulness of our model. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

The network contains co-authorship information from January 1996 to December 2016. We fit ERGMs and TERGMs to the network as a function of nodal, dyadic and structural statistics terms, accounting for important principles of graph theory such as homophily and structural equivalence. The final ERGM and TERGM showed that the mechanistic phenomenon driving collaboration ties in malaria research in Benin is driven by homophily on the type of affiliation and by membership to a research group. Our study is one of a few to take a model-based approach to the study ofco-authorship networks.",

The aim of this study was to model the contagion of physical activity based on empirical Twitter data and to assess the role of homophily within this contagion. To model the contagion of physical activity, an adaptive temporal-causal network model was designed, and accordingly, the parameters of the model were tuned using empirical data obtained from Twitter. Two variants of the adaptive temporal-causal network model were created, in which one calculated the weights of the connections between the nodes based on follow relations on Twitter, while in the other the connection weights were modulated by the homophily principle. The results indicate that within the considered social network of already active persons homophily does not play an important role in the physical activity behaviour.",
Homophily Independent Cascade Diffusion Model Based on Textual Information,"COMPUTATIONAL COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE, ICCCI 2018, PT I",2018,2018,"In this research, we proposed homophily independent cascade model based on textual information, namely Textual-Homo-IC. This model based on standard independent cascade model; however, we exploited the aspect of infected probability estimation relied on homophily. Particularly, homophily is measured based on textual content by utilizing topic modeling. The process of propagation takes place on agent's network where each agent represents a node. In addition to expressing the Textual-Homo-IC model on the static network, we also revealed it on dynamic agent's network where there is not only transformation of the structure but also the node's properties during the spreading process. We conducted experiments on two collected data sets from NIPS and a social network platform-Twitter and have attained satisfactory results.",
On the Emergence of Segregation in Society: Network-Oriented Analysis of the Effect of Evolving Friendships,"COMPUTATIONAL COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE, ICCCI 2018, PT I",2018,2018,"Segregation is a widely-observed phenomenon through history, different cultures and around the world. This paper addresses how in a network of immigrants segregation emerges from friendship homophily. The simulation results show that homophily results in clusters of lower and higher local language use. A mathematical analysis provides a more in depth understanding of the phenomena observed in the simulations.",
Copresence networks,2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS (ISI),2018,2018,"Copresence networks are constructed by associating individuals who are at the same place at the same. time in our case at police-involved incidents. They generalize networks such a co-offender networks, which are becoming mainstream police and intelligence tools. Because copresence can be generated from police incident data, such networks are cheap to construct since they require no specialised surveillance they arc implicit in data that is routinely collected.We demonstrate that copresence network analytics, using graph embedding, gives a sense of the criminal landscape in a city; shows the importance of non-criminals in this landscape; and suggests targets for further in-depth attention (unusual subgroups, non-criminals who are brokers). We also show that homophily in level of criminality generally holds, but there are strong exceptions that deserve police attention. Copresence networks also arise naturally in other domains such as border protection and intelligence surveillance, so the techniques described here are also applicable in those domains.",
Analyzing Group Interaction on Networks of Face-to-Face Proximity using Wearable Sensors,2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUTURE IOT TECHNOLOGIES (FUTURE IOT),2018,2018,"The Internet of Things as well as smart devices enable the capture of multi-modal social interaction data at large-scale. For understanding the behavior of the involved actors, as well as to enable structural modeling, the analysis of the according social interaction networks is essential. In contrast to standard approaches that capture social network data using questionaires, this paper describes an analysis at larger scale using sensor data collected by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. We complement it by informant self-report data obtained using surveys. We focus on the social network of a students' freshman week, and investigate research questions concerning the communication behavior and structure, gender homophily, and inter-relations of sensor-based (RFID) and self-report social networks.",

Homophily and Nationality Assortativity Among the Most Cited Researchers' Social Network,2018 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM),2018,2018,"It is well known that individuals in social networks tend to exhibit homophily, the preference of people to associate with others from the same social group or type. Graph assortativity or Modularity is the most accepted measure for the homophily level of the whole network. It is well defined for simple networks where each node has a single type, and edges are unweighted.In this work, we extend modularity and assortativity in several ways. First, we define type assortativity which measures the homophily level of each type and enable the comparison between types of different size within the network. Second, we extend the measures to the case of nodes with multiple types and weighted edges. We evaluate our definitions on a weighted, research collaboration, social network between the most cited authors in the ACM digital library. We use nationality-based multiple types where a author can belong to multiple nationalities. While nationality-based homophily is trivial when the network is large (based on local research at universities) our empirical results show that even for the top 1000 authors a high level of nationality-based homophily exists, and different nationalities exhibit a different level of homophily.",
Probabilistic Causal Analysis of Social Influence,CIKM'18: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,2018,2018,"Mastering the dynamics of social influence requires separating, in a database of information propagation traces, the genuine causal processes from temporal correlation, i.e., homophily and other spurious causes. However, most studies to characterize social influence, and, in general, most data-science analyses focus on correlations, statistical independence, or conditional independence. Only recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in ""causal data science,"" e.g., grounded on causality theories. In this paper we adopt a principled causal approach to the analysis of social influence from information-propagation data, rooted in the theory of probabilistic causation.Our approach consists of two phases. In the first one, in order to avoid the pitfalls of misinterpreting causation when the data spans a mixture of several subtypes (""Simpson's paradox""), we partition the set of propagation traces into groups, in such a way that each group is as less contradictory as possible in terms of the hierarchical structure of information propagation. To achieve this goal, we borrow the notion of ""agony"" [ 26] and define the Agony-bounded Partitioning problem, which we prove being hard, and for which we develop two efficient algorithms with approximation guarantees. In the second phase, for each group from the first phase, we apply a constrained MLE approach to ultimately learn a minimal causal topology. Experiments on synthetic data show that our method is able to retrieve the genuine causal arcs w.r.t. a ground-truth generative model. Experiments on real data show that, by focusing only on the extracted causal structures instead of the whole social graph, the effectiveness of predicting influence spread is significantly improved.",
LHONE: Label Homophily Oriented Network Embedding,2018 24TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION (ICPR),2018,2018,"Network embedding is to learn effective low-dimensional vector representations for nodes in a network and has attracted considerable attention in recent years. To date, existing methods mainly focus on network structure information and cannot leverage abundant label information, which is potentially valuable in learning better vector representations. Due to the noise and incompleteness of label information, it is intractable to integrate label information into the vector representations in a partially labeled network. To address this issue, we investigate the effects of label information based on the label homophily. Briefly, label homophily can not only drive nodes sharing similar labels to be connected to each other, but also produce a division of a network into densely-connected, homogeneous parts that are weakly connected to each other. Furthermore, we propose a novel Label Homophily Oriented Network Embedding (LHONE) model to make the best of label homophily by converting a partially labeled network to two bipartite networks, and learning vector representations combined with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Extensive experiments on two real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of LHONE compared to state-of-the-art network embedding approaches.",
A Study on Gender Differences in Organizational Network Structures,Gender and Culture,2018,2018,"This study investigates the way in which gender differences affect organizational social network compositions, using social network theory to examine networks of employees. Empirical research was carried out on 1,200 employees in various organizations. The results of the study are as follows. First, the tendency for gender homophily among respondents and advisors in friendship and task-advice networks was higher for male employees than for female employees. Second, there was no statistically significant relationship between friendship networks and task-advice networks, though there was a higher network overlap among males in terms of age, education level, and job level. Finally, this study finds that there are systematic gender differences in the composition of social networks. These differences are related the systematic and structural disadvantages within organizations that female employees face when it comes to promotion, compensation, and mistreatment, and lead female employees to develop their own strategies to compose social networks.",
Information/Media Selection and Bias Mobilization : the Case of Taegeuk-gi rally,Korean Political Science Review,2018,2018,"This paper empirically analyzes the effects of information/media selection and use on bias mobilization. In the intelligent information society where multi-channel media environment is settled, the most important characteristic of communication is that data distribution is entirely controlled in the individual dimension. Therefore bias mobilization can be facilitated by intrinsic information monophagia rather than phenomenal information abundance. Especially in critical elections and large-scale social movements, its possibility becomes even greater. In this context, this study empirically demonstrates how the mechanism of media reliability, selective exposure, ideological motivation and homophily influence bias mobilization in the case of Taegeuk-gi rally.",
Demographic variability and scales of agreement and disagreement over resource management restrictions,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,2018,2018,"Conflicts over the imposition of restrictions in common-pool resources management institutions are expected to arise from variations in human values, perceptions of justice, and the disparate demographic scales of benefits and costs. We hypothesized and tested a series of propositions about how the demographic scale and context of common restrictions would influence coral reef fisheries of 4 African countries. We surveyed the preferences and perceived benefits of 1849 people in 89 fish landing sites for 6 common restrictions of increasing severity. Variability in perceived benefits within and between neighboring communities was evaluated to determine how perceptions changed with the severity of the proposed benefit/cost restriction scale, perceived benefits, disparities between beneficiaries, and national context. Within-community variability declined strongly (r(2) > 0.90) as perceived benefit increased but was either weak or not significantly associated with the neighbor-community's variation. Within-community variation was less than between-community variation and differed by nation. There was generally broader scale agreement on the benefits of weaker restrictions of minimum sizes of fish and allowable fishing gear and more disagreement on stronger restrictions on species, time, and space use. Reduced variability was strongly associated with less perceived disparity in the benefits received by local versus government beneficiaries. These findings indicate potential conflicts between neighboring communities for most, but particularly the strongest, restrictions. Consequently, the broadscale management benefits of strong restrictions will need to address between-community compliance and justice procedures. Demographic variability requires coordinating governance and management to account for restriction-specific variability in the perceptions of management benefits.",
Big Open-Source Social Science: Capabilities and methodology for automating social science analytics,NEXT-GENERATION ANALYST VI,2018,2018,"Currently, obtaining reliable situational awareness of the social landscape is an arduous, lengthy process involving manual analyses by social scientists. These traditional methods do not scale to the speed and diversity required by DoD operations or the high-speed, international business model in today's corporate environment. Conversely, ""big data"" easily scales to meet these challenges but lacks the rigor of social science theory. We present Big Open-Source Social Science (BOSSS), a research and development project that leverages the strengths of social- and computer-science technology to address the operational need for rapid and reliable human-landscape situational-awareness. BOSSS iteratively filters, navigates, and summarizes diverse open-source data to characterize a local population's social structure, conflicts, cleavages, affinities, and animosities. BOSSS automatically scrapes open-access data from the web and performs natural language processing to populate a knowledge graph with a custom schema. BOSSS then mines the graph to extract key, theory-agnostic social-science principles of human inter-relations and dynamics . homophily, stratification, sentiment, and conflict. Automated quantitative social-network analysis provides up-to-date indicators of trends or anomalies within the local population's social landscape. BOSSS' s emerging technology will provide a dramatic reduction in the cognitive workload for the next generation of analysts and will facilitate more rapid situational awareness both for deployed soldiers and private companies conducting operations abroad.",
Estimating Peer-Influence Effects Under Homophily: Randomized Treatments and Insights,COMPLEX NETWORKS IX,2018,2018,"When doing causal inference on networks, there is interference among the units. In a social network setting, such interference among individuals is known as peer-influence. Estimating the causal effect of peer-influence under the presence of homophily presents various challenges. In this paper, we present results quantifying the error incurred from ignoring homophily when estimating peer-influence on networks. We then present randomized treatment strategies on networks which can help disentangle homophily from the estimation of peer-influence.",
Self-organization in multilayer network with adaptation mechanisms based on competition,SARATOV FALL MEETING 2017: LASER PHYSICS AND PHOTONICS XVIII; AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS AND ANALYSIS OF BIOMEDICAL DATA IV,2018,2018,"The paper considers the phenomena of competition in multiplex network whose structure evolves corresponding to dynamics of it's elements, forming closed loop of self-learning with the aim to reach the optimal topology. Numerical analysis of proposed model shows that it is possible to obtain scale-invariant structures for corresponding parameters as well as the structures with homogeneous distribution of connections in the layers. Revealed phenomena emerges as the consequence of the self-organization processes related to structure-dynamical self-learning based on homeostasis and homophily, as well as the result of the competition between the network's layers for optimal topology. It was shown that in the mode of partial and cluster synchronization the network reaches scale-free topology of complex nature that is different from layer to layer. However, in the mode of global synchronization the homogeneous topologies on all layer of the network are observed. This phenomenon is tightly connected with the competitive processes that represent themselves as the natural mechanism of reaching the optimal topology of the links in variety of real-world systems.",
Social interaction and pain: An arctic expedition,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Jan 2018,2018,"Complex human behaviour can only be understood within its social environment. However, disentangling the causal links between individual outcomes and social network position is empirically challenging. We present a research design in a closed real-world setting with high-resolution temporal data to understand this interplay within a fundamental human experience physical pain. Study participants completed an isolated 3-week hiking expedition in the Arctic Circle during which they were subject to the same variation in environmental conditions and only interacted amongst themselves. Adolescents provided daily ratings of pain and social interaction partners. Using longitudinal network models, we analyze the interplay between social network position and the experience of pain. Specifically, we test whether experiencing pain is linked to decreasing popularity (increasing isolation), whether adolescents prefer to interact with others experiencing similar pain (homophily), and whether participants are increasingly likely to report similar pain as their interaction partners (contagion). We find that reporting pain is associated with decreasing popularity interestingly, this effect holds for males only. Further exploratory analyses suggest this is at least partly driven by males withdrawing from contact with females when in pain, enhancing our understanding of pain and masculinity. Contrary to recent experimental and clinical studies, we found no evidence of pain homophily or contagion in the expedition group.",
Silhouette for the Evaluation of Community Structures in Multiplex Networks,COMPLEX NETWORKS IX,2018,2018,"This paper focuses on the silhouette as validity criterion for community structures in networks, with emphasis on multiplex networks. We propose a versatile definition of the silhouette, by generalizing it to encompass different scenarios of proximity between entities in a network, where the distance notion can be geodesic-based or homophily-oriented. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose this twofold perspective on the silhouette and its extension to deal with multiplex networks. We also define an approximate variant of the multiplex silhouette to speed up its computation on large networks, based on the exploitation of central nodes to be regarded as community representatives. Experimental results performed on benchmark real-world network datasets have revealed that the proposed multiplex silhouette is positively correlated with its approximate version, while the latter proved to be much faster in terms of execution time.",
"Mapping an Entrepreneurial, Innovative and Sustainable Ecosystem Using Social Network Analysis: An Exploratory Approach of Publicly Funded Innovative Project Data","ENTREPRENEURIAL, INNOVATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEMS: BEST PRACTICES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR QUALITY OF LIFE",2018,2018,"The innovative dynamics of a region largely depends on existing actors and their connectivity, so the resilience of a particular innovation system can be analysed through the study innovation networks. Starting from the Algarve's case study, this analysis uses methods of social network structural analysis to map actors and centralities regarding cooperation and innovation in regional development. The chapter uses data collected through web content mining, starting from the list of organizations that have benefited from public support to innovation. The mapping of the innovation network in the Algarve is compared to theoretical models of resilient networks with the statistical indicators of hierarchy and homophily. The results facilitate the identification of gatekeepers, clusters of activities and constraints and potentialities to the enhancement of the regional entrepreneurial, innovative and sustainable (EIS) ecosystem. This approach has high potential for replication in other regions. The chapter concludes with policy implications for the EIS ecosystem's resilience and dynamics.",
Gender-Based Analysis of Intra-Institutional Research Productivity and Collaboration,FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE,2018,2018,"Current Research Information Systems (CRISs) offer great opportunities for assessments of institutional research outputs and extraction of useful and actionable knowledge based on various data-analysis techniques. However, many of these opportunities have not been explored in depth, especially in culture-sensitive areas such as gender-based analysis of research productivity and collaboration. In this paper we present GERBER, a network-based methodology and accompanying tool for gender-based analysis of publication data stored in institutional CRISs. GERBER relies on statistically robust techniques applied on weighted co-authorship networks whose nodes are enriched with different types of researcher evaluation metrics. The functionality of GERBER is demonstrated on publication data stored in the institutional CRIS of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia. The obtained results show that GERBER enables institutional research managers and policy makers to detect gender inequalities and homophily in research productivity and collaboration. Finally, we discuss different possibilities to integrate GERBER with CRISs in order to facilitate continuous gender-based evaluation of researchers.",
Poster Abstract: Homophily and Controversy: On the Role of Public Opinion in Online Viral Diffusion,IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOPS (INFOCOM WKSHPS),2018,2018,"It is critical in social network analysis to understand the underlying mechanisms of online information diffusion. Although there has been much progress on the influential factors that lead to online viral diffusion, little is known about the impact by public opinion. In this paper, we examine the relations between the public opinion among information propagators and the virality of online diffusion based on a large-scale real-world dataset. We propose a set of new metrics for public opinion in online diffusion to reveal their correlation with diffusion structural virality, and further apply our understanding to predict diffusion virality based on public opinion. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed analysis in the prediction of viral diffusion events.",
A User-centered Approach for Integrating Social Actors into Communities of Interest,2018 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH CHALLENGES IN INFORMATION SCIENCE (RCIS),2018,2018,"Detecting communities of interest is a complex problem that has been addressed from different perspectives. In this work, we propose a user-centered approach incorporating social user profiles in community detection for online Social Networks. In our approach, we first compute explicit knowledge acquisition. By exploring the egocentric networks of users, we can infer implicit similarities of interest. The similarity is estimated with reference to homophily and social influence. The latter is leveraged to enhance Sentiment Analysis within communities. Finally, we conduct experiments on datasets extracted from real-world Social Networks.",
Explaining the Emergence of Political Fragmentation on Social Media: The Role of Ideology and Extremism,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Jan 2018,2018,"This article is a systematic large-scale study of the reasons driving political fragmentation on social media. Making use of a comparative dataset of the Twitter discussion activities of 115 political groups in 26 countries, it shows that groups that are further apart in ideological terms interact less, and that groups that sit at the extremes of the ideological scale are particularly likely to have lower patterns of interaction. Indeed, exchanges between centrists who sit on different sides of the left-right divide are more likely than connections between centrists and extremists who are from the same ideological wing. In light of the results, theory about exposure to different ideological viewpoints online is enhanced.",
Analyzing Political Information Network of the US Partisan Public on Twitter,"TRANSFORMING DIGITAL WORLDS, ICONFERENCE 2018",2018,2018,"The growing significance of social media among potential voters has been recognized by politicians because social media provides a direct method for political actors to connect with their citizens and organize them into online clusters through their use of hashtags. However, with few exclusions, most of the former studies stressed on the identification of personal tweets or cumulative properties of a mass of tweets and political fondness of discrete users, not on partisan public in the U.S. Thus, there is a lack of complete understanding about online social network of politically conflicting public and the public discourse in the network. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate how people adopt political information on Twitter via hashtag as a networked public and how people facilitate political communication among users with similar or disparate political orientations. This study confirmed the theory of homophily in adopting political hashtags on Twitter network. The referred media and highly mentioned domains for each network also support the concept of homophily. The manually examined users with top betweenness centralities were identified as opinion leaders and their tweeting patterns provide evidences that they play key roles in disseminating information through eWOM by occupying an important relational spot in the network.",
Stance Evolution and Twitter Interactions in an Italian Political Debate,NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (NLDB 2018),2018,2018,"The number of communications and messages generated by users on social media platforms has progressively increased in the last years. Therefore, the issue of developing automated systems for a deep analysis of users' generated contents and interactions is becoming increasingly relevant. In particular, when we focus on the domain of online political debates, interest for the automatic classification of users' stance towards a given entity, like a controversial topic or a politician, within a polarized debate is significantly growing. In this paper we propose a new model for stance detection in Twitter, where authors' messages are not considered in isolation, but in a diachronic perspective for shedding light on users' opinion shift dynamics along the temporal axis. Moreover, different types of social network community, based on retweet, quote, and reply relations were analyzed, in order to extract network-based features to be included in our stance detection model. The model has been trained and evaluated on a corpus of Italian tweets where users were discussing on a highly polarized debate in Italy, i.e. the 2016 referendum on the reform of the Italian Constitution. The development of a new annotated corpus for stance is described. Analysis and classification experiments show that network-based features help in detecting stance and confirm the importance of modeling stance in a diachronic perspective.",
Facilitating affective experiences to stimulate women's entrepreneurship in rural India,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENDER AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP,2018,2018,"Purpose This paper aims to understand the nature of affective experiences that can help women to overcome perceived socio-cultural constraints and stimulate entrepreneurship. The paper focuses on rural poor women in India as they represent cultural contexts rich with impediments while also presenting an opportunity for socio-economic development.Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study with interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted with participants from women-owned and -managed crafts-based cooperative entrepreneurial ventures from the state of Bihar in India.Findings Cooperative form of entrepreneurship and sisterhood among its members provides an environment for repeated affective experiences that inspire women to change the status quo. Sisterhood facilitates interactions with role models, mentee-driven mentoring and vicarious incentives, each producing positive affect, whereas cooperatives provide a work environment that fosters equality and helps women find their unique voice, generating affect. Together, the affect allows women to overcome fears associated with deviating from age-old traditions while engaging in entrepreneurial behaviors and sustaining them.Research limitations/implications The paper advances knowledge on women entrepreneurship for non-Western cultural contexts, particularly the environments and experiences that stimulate entrepreneurship. The values of cooperative form of entrepreneurship and the homophily among sisters creates an environment which is relaxed and comfortable, where affective experiences can be naturally embedded in daily routines in contrast to those created through formal-structured training programmes. The paper findings are limited to cultural contexts of rural women in eastern states of India with high levels of poverty.Practical implications Policies for cooperative entrepreneurship and grassroots support to facilitate an environment to foster cooperatives' values, and sisterhood can lead to affective experiences necessary for change that endures.Originality/value Entrepreneurship for pervasive social change, such as alleviating rural women from poverty, needs theory development, particularly a better understanding of the influence of macro socio-cultural contexts on women's ability to be entrepreneurial. This paper provides an understanding of contextually relevant affective experiences conducive for rural women entrepreneurship.",
Teachers' intergenerational advice and information seeking: content matters!,JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL CAPITAL AND COMMUNITY,2018,2018,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of generation in teachers' advice and information-seeking interactions in Flemish secondary school teams, and moreover how the content of advice shapes these interactions. Four content-related advice and information-seeking networks are investigated in this study: subject-matter knowledge, classroom management, innovative teaching methods and ICT.Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 660 teachers in ten secondary education schools in Flanders (Belgium) by using an online socio-metric survey. Social network analysis was conducted, more specifically quadratic assignment procedure and multilevel P2 modeling.Findings - The findings underline the importance of investigating content-related advice networks. Generation affects the formation of interactions. First, the results revealed that older teachers are less likely to ask advice on subject-matter knowledge, classroom management and innovative teaching methods. Second, the data showed that older teachers are more likely to be asked for advice on subject-matter knowledge. Third, young teachers are more likely to be asked for advice on innovative teaching methods and ICT. Fourth, homophily effects occurred for the youngest teachers when advice is about subject-matter knowledge, and for the oldest teachers for advice about classroom management.Originality/value - This study is innovative due to its application of social network analysis to investigate intergenerational knowledge flows, and due to its clear focus on content-related advice-seeking interactions that go beyond the approach of general advice and information-seeking interactions.",
"Befriending the same differently: ethnic, socioeconomic status, and gender differences in same-ethnic friendship",JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,2018,2018,"This study examines same-ethnic friendship variation between students from different ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender groups. Hypotheses based on a theoretical framework of opportunities, preferences, and third-party influence are tested on data of 11,063 students in English, German, Dutch, and Swedish school classes. Using structural equation modelling, the results indicate that ethnic groups differ in absolute and relative same-ethnic friendship because of different meeting opportunities with same-ethnic peers in class and a different status in the ethnic hierarchy. Socioeconomic status groups differ in same-ethnic friendship because socioeconomic status sorts students into more or less diverse school classes but not consistently so across countries and groups. Little further evidence is found for a relation between socioeconomic status and same-ethnic friendship preferences. Lastly, boys and girls do not seem to differ much regarding same-ethnic friendship.",
A social-contextual investigation of smoking among rural women: multi-level factors associated with smoking status and considerations for cessation,RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH,2018,2018,"Introduction: The social-contextual model of tobacco control and the potential mechanisms of the maintenance or cessation of smoking behavior among disadvantaged women, including rural residents, have yet to be comprehensively studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between selected individual, interpersonal, workplace, and neighborhood characteristics and smoking status among women in Appalachia, a US region whose residents experience a disproportionate prevalence of tobacco-related health disparities. These findings may assist in efforts to design and test scientifically valid tobacco control interventions for this and other disadvantaged populations.Methods: Women, 18 years of age and older, residing in three rural Ohio Appalachian counties, were recruited using a two-phase address-based sampling methodology for a cross-sectional interview-administered survey between August 2012 and October 2013 (N=408). Multinomial logistic regression was employed to determine associations between select multilevel factors (independent variables) and smoking status (dependent variable). The sample included 82 (20.1%) current smokers, 92 (22.5%) former smokers, and 234 (57.4%) women reporting never smoking (mean age 51.7 years).Results: In the final multivariable multinomial logistic regression model, controlling for all other significant associations, constructs at multiple social-contextual levels were associated with current versus either former or never smoking. At the individual level, for every additional year in age, the odds of being a former or never smoker increased by 7% and 6% (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval(CI)): 1.07 (1.0-1.11) and 1.06 (1.02-1.09)), respectively, as compared to the odds of being a current smoker. With regard to depression, for each one unit increase in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score, the odds of being a former or never smoker were 5% and 7% lower (OR(95%CI): 0.95(0.91-0.999) and 0.93(0.88-0.98)), respectively. Five interpersonal factors were associated with smoking status. As the social influence injunctive norm score increased by one unit, indicating perception of smoking to be more acceptable, the odds of being a former or never smoker decreased by 23% and 30%, respectively. For every one unit increase in the social participation score, indicating past-year engagement in one additional activity type, the odds of being a former or never smoker increased by 17% and 36%, respectively. For every 10% increase in the percentage of social ties in the participant's advice network who smoked, the odds of being a former or never smoker were 24% and 28% less, respectively. For every 0.1 unit increase in the E/I index, indicating increasing homophily on smoking in one's social network, the odds of being a former or never smoker were 20% and 24% less, respectively, in the time network, and 18% and 20% less, respectively, in the advice network. At the neighborhood level, for every one unit increase in neighborhood cohesion score, indicating increasing cohesion, the odds of being a former smoker or never smoker were 12% and 14% less, respectively.Conclusions: These findings indicate that a social-contextual approach to tobacco control may be useful for narrowing a widening trajectory of smoking disparity for rural women. Interpersonal context, in particular, must be considered in the development of culturally targeted cessation interventions for Ohio Appalachian women.",
BEHAVIORAL STRATEGY: AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT OF SUPERIOR PROFITABILITY?,BEHAVIORAL STRATEGY IN PERSPECTIVE,2018,2018,"Behavioral strategy completes the analyses of superior profitability by highlighting how non-economic, behavioral barriers generate an alternative source of strategic opportunities. Existing internal and external analysis frameworks fail to explain why strategic factors can be systematically mis-priced and why large firms' structural and resource advantage are regularly disrupted by entrepreneurs. We argue that the systematic biases documented in the behavioral and organizational sciences in fact illuminate an alternative source of competitive advantage. Strategists could develop superior insights into the value of resources and recognize factors that are either under- or overvalued while competitors remain blind to such possibilities. Our argument is illustrated by how three ""underdogs"" disrupted the incumbents in their industries by exploiting rivals' predictable biases and blind spots. We conclude by discussing how our ideas can be generalized as an alternative, behavioral approach for strategy.",

"Health, Grades and Friendship: How Socially Constructed Characteristics Influence the Social Network Structure","ANALYSIS OF IMAGES, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND TEXTS, AIST 2017",2018,2018,"Homophily - tendency for people to form social connections with similar others - is one of the key topics in social network analysis. It indicates to what extent people tend to be similar to their friends and in what dimensions. For the long time homophily was just an index of the social similarity, but for the recent years the interest for the homophily formation, dynamics and multidimensionality increased. In this paper we investigate the homophily in such social constructed behavior as food consumption and academic achievements. The study of body mass index in social network context reveals the presence of homophily, which means that persons with similar constitution are more likely to be interconnected with each other. Interestingly, that healthy food consumption has no impact on social network formation, but there is homophily based on fast food consumption. Thus, 'bad habits' are stronger forces for the social ties formation. This results show that social constructed behavior is an important component on the process of social network formation.",
Does language homophily affect migrant consumers' service usage intentions?,JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING,2018,2018,"Purpose This paper investigates how language homophily between service providers and migrant consumers affects migrant consumers' intentions to engage with financial and medical service providers.Design/methodology/approach Three empirical studies were conducted with migrant consumers living in Chile, England and the USA. Participants were presented information on service providers, and language homophily was manipulated between subjects. In the high (low) language homophily condition, service providers were described as having (not having) the ability to speak the native language of the migrant consumer.Findings Language homophily was found to increase migrant consumers' expectation of control over a service encounter and, in turn, increase their intention to use a provider's services. Collectivism was identified as a boundary condition. Among high collectivist consumers, language homophily did not affect service usage intentions; however, language homophily did positively affect service usage intentions among low collectivist consumers.Originality/value This work extends prior research on service provider language by finding a positive effect of language homophily on service usage intentions and by identifying mediating (i.e. expected control over the outcome of the service encounter) and moderating (i.e. collectivism) mechanisms for this effect.",
The Landscape of Causal Inference: Perspective From Citation Network Analysis,AMERICAN STATISTICIAN,2018,2018,"Causal inference is a fast-growing multidisciplinary field that has drawn extensive interests from statistical sciences and health and social sciences. In this article, we gather comprehensive information on publications and citations in causal inference and provide a review of the field from the perspective of citation network analysis. We provide descriptive analyses by showing the most cited publications, the most prolific and the most cited authors, and structural properties of the citation network. Then, we examine the citation network through exponential random graph models (ERGMs). We show that both technical aspects of the publications (e.g., publication length, time and quality) and social processes such as homophily (the tendency to cite publications in the same field or with shared authors), cumulative advantage, and transitivity (the tendency to cite references' references), matter for citations. We also provide specific analysis of citations among the top authors in the field and present a ranking and clustering of the authors. Overall, our article reveals new insights into the landscape of the field of causal inference and may serve as a case study for analyzing citation networks in a multidisciplinary field and for fitting ERGMs on big networks. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",

Relationship of the Elementary Sixth Graders’ Multicultural Acceptance and their Peers Networks in Highly-concentrated Multicultural Neighborhoods in Gyeonggi Province - The Ratio of Multicultural Students in the Classroom,The Educational Research for Tomorrow,2018,2018,"The purpose of this study is to examine relationships between the elementary sixth graders’ multicultural acceptance and peer networks by the ratio of multicultural students in the classroom. For this, we used multilevel models with data from the sixth graders (N=264) among 12 classrooms in three elementary schools in highly-concentrated multicultural neighborhoods in Gyeonggi province. The results showed that first, in classes composed 40% multicultural students, the higher the openness and awareness, the more peer nomination as close friends. However, in the 40% and 30% classrooms, the lower the empathy, the more peer nomination as close friends. Second, in the 40% classrooms, the higher the empathy, the more self nomination by others as close friends. In addition, in the 20% classrooms, the higher the multicultural relationship, the more self nomination by others as close friends. Third, we found that the peer networks of multicultural students showed cultural homophily in the 10% classrooms, while all showed gender homophily.",
The Effect of Founding Teams on the Performance of Social Enterprises,,2018,2018,"Founding teams have a lasting impact on the structure and survival of the organization. This study analyzed the effects of the characteristics of the founding teams and their effects on performance of 210 social enterprises in Korea. People with the same gender constitute entrepreneurial teams, and people with close social relationships with founders attend the entrepreneurial team. A team composed of strong social relationships contributes to the stability the founding teams. While founding teams with strong ties have negative effects on performance, those with weak ties have positive effects. This study suggests the theoretical and practical implications of how team members should be structured in order to achieve organizational stability and organizational performance in the formation of a startup team.",
Analyze Users' Online Shopping Behavior Using Interconnected Online Interest-Product Network,2018 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC),2018,2018,"In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet, more and more users shop and socialize online, which produces a large amount of traffic data. Analyzing users' online shopping behavior is important for merchants to improve profit. Social networks are widely used in studying the relationship among users. In this paper, we apply the concept of social networks to online shopping behavior, and present a novel network perspective on the interconnected nature of online interest and product, allowing us to capture the attribute of online products reflecting users' sociability. Sociability in this paper is not a traditional social connection but common interests(defined by produce visiting behavior) among users. First, we build an interconnected online interest-product network which includes online shopping based social network (OSSN), online product network and intermediate layer, and we define popular online products and non-popular online products according to the number of distinct visitors of one product. Then, we analyze some indicators about OSSN, and find that OSSN has similar characteristics with traditional social networks, such as small world feature and homophily. Finally, we analyze how online products reflect users' sociability. With the number of online products users have visited increasing, the number of neighbors with similar interests first presents a positive correlation, and then disappears, which implies that the number of users' neighbors depends on the attribute of online products rather than the number of online products users have browsed. We define a formula to measure the attribute of online products reflecting users' sociability, and find that there is a distinct difference among different categories of online products, and non-popular online products often have high value of attribute to reflect users' sociability and the value is low in popular online products.",
Identification of Homophily and Preferential Recruitment in Respondent-Driven Sampling,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,Jan 1 2018,2018,"Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a link-tracing procedure used in epidemiologic research on hidden or hard-to-reach populations in which subjects recruit others via their social networks. Estimates from RDS studies may have poor statistical properties due to statistical dependence in sampled subjects' traits. Two distinct mechanisms account for dependence in an RDS study: homophily, the tendency for individuals to share social ties with others exhibiting similar characteristics, and preferential recruitment, in which recruiters do not recruit uniformly at random from their network alters. The different effects of network homophily and preferential recruitment in RDS studies have been a source of confusion and controversy in methodological and empirical research in epidemiology. In this work, we gave formal definitions of homophily and preferential recruitment and showed that neither is identified in typical RDS studies. We derived non-parametric identification regions for homophily and preferential recruitment and showed that these parameters were not identified unless the network took a degenerate form. The results indicated that claims of homophily or recruitment bias measured from empirical RDS studies may not be credible. We applied our identification results to a study involving both a network census and RDS on a population of injection drug users in Hartford, Connecticut (2012-2013).",
Three dimensions of the public sphere on Facebook,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,2018,2018,"The article provides an empirical analysis of the online public sphere in the three dimensions introduced by Dahlgren (2005): structural, representational and interactional. The main subject of analysis is the largest social networking site - Facebook - and Polish users' activity on the Facebook Pages of political parties and politicians. The researchers analysed data about all users active on those Pages during two 4-month periods in 2013 and 2015. The results of the study show that only a small fraction of Facebook users are active in public political discussions that take place on political Facebook Pages (structural dimension). However, the level of engagement depends on the current political events taking place within the public sphere offline, and users are more active during electoral campaigns. Moreover, Facebook does not provide an alternative public sphere for political actors that are less present in mainstream media. Parties and politicians that are visible in traditional media are also attracting active fans in social media (representational dimension). Nonetheless, non-parliamentary groups have more active fans than would result only from their popularity in mainstream media. Finally, the online public on Facebook is fragmented and clustered into homogenous political groups (interactional dimension), thus supporting the hypothesis on echo chambers' presented by Sunstein (2001). The divisions are smaller when there are significantly more users involved. However, most of these cross-cutting links are the result of the electoral campaign.",
Using Rhetorical/Relational Goal Theory to Examine College Students' Impressions of Their Instructors,COMMUNICATION RESEARCH REPORTS,2018,2018,"Guided by rhetorical/relational goal theory, the purpose of this study was to examine whether students' impressions of their instructors' credibility, attraction, and homophily are influenced by four specific rhetorical and relational communication behaviors that instructors use when communicating with their students in the classroom. Participants were 193 undergraduate students enrolled in a variety of introductory communication courses at a large mid-Atlantic university. Using a series of multiple regression analyses, it was found that (a) clarity emerged as the sole indicator of instructor competence, trustworthiness, and task attraction; (b) clarity and confirmation emerged as indicators of goodwill; and (c) humor and confirmation emerged as indicators of social attraction and attitude homophily.",
Towards Understanding Community Interests With Topic Modeling,IEEE ACCESS,2018,2018,"Community plays an important role in shaping a network. Quantitatively interpreting a community is necessary for graph generalization which is used for privacy preserving, summarization, and dimensionality reduction in social network mining. However, there are few works in community detection focusing on making sense of the identified communities. In this paper, we study communities in the social media context and investigate structure-based communities from the perspective of community topical homophily. We train Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model to capture the topics in the aggregated tweets of each user in a community and propose new distance metrics to quantify the topic similarity of individual users, cliques, and communities. By building a Twitter topic modeling system to interpret the communities identified by two community detection algorithms in a large scale Twitter topology, we discover evidence that Twitter users in a community show common interests in general. The major contributions of this paper lie in that it verifies the topical homophily in structure-based social media communities and proposes new metrics to quantitatively label the degree of the homophily and describe the theme of the communities.",
Social networks and social support among ball-attending African American men who have sex with men and transgender women are associated with HIV-related outcomes,GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH,2018,2018,"The House Ball Community (HBC) is an understudied network of African American men who have sex with men and transgender women, who join family-like houses that compete in elaborate balls in cities across the United States. From 2011 to 2012, we surveyed 274 recent attendees of balls in the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on social networks, social support, and HIV-related behaviours. Participants with a high percentage of alters who were supportive of HIV testing were significantly more likely to have tested in the past six months (p = .02), and less likely to have engaged in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past three months (p = .003). Multivariate regression analyses of social network characteristics, and social support, revealed that testing in the past six months was significantly associated with social support for safer sex, instrumental social support, and age. Similarly, UAI in the past three months was significantly associated with social support for safer sex, homophily based on sexual identity and HIV status. HIV-related social support provided through the HBC networks was correlated with recent HIV testing and reduced UAI. Approaches utilising networks within alternative kinship systems, may increase HIV-related social support and improve HIV-related outcomes.",
"A Study on the Relationship of Relational Antecedents, e-WOM and e-loyalty of SNS: Focus on Korean and Mongolian Users",Journal of Korea Research Association of International Commerce,2018,2018,"This study aims to investigate the relationship between relational antecedents of SNS, e-WOM (e-Word of Mouth) and e-loyalty of SNS users in Korea and Mongolia. In order to achieve this goal, this study has reviewed literature on e-WOM definition and previous research. This study posits that relational antecedents of SNS(tie strength, homophily, trust) are positively related to e-WOM (opinion seeking, giving, passing) and e-WOM has a positive relationship with e-loyalty. The survey questionnaire was prepared by reviewing existing literature and expert opinions. The data used in this study were collected from university and graduate students in Korea and Mongolia. The results are as follows. First, it shows that the relational antecedents of SNS is positively related to e-WOM in Korean SNS. Mongolian users are slightly different from the empirical research results in Korea. Only Thai strength and trust affect the e-WOM of Mongolian SNS users. Second, e-WOM has a positive effect on e-loyalty of SNS users in Korea and Mongolia.",
WOM source characteristics and message quality: the receiver perspective,MARKETING INTELLIGENCE & PLANNING,2018,2018,"Purpose Word-of-mouth (WOM) literature has identified the roles of source and message in WOM influence, but the relationship between them is yet to be investigated. The purpose of this paper is to explore this relationship by examining the mediation of message on the impact of perceived source characteristics from the perspective of the receiver. The paper also considered the mutual relationships between source characteristics and message quality.Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey of prospective students was conducted to empirically examine the proposed conceptual model. A sample of 509 respondents was analysed using structural equation modelling.Findings The findings suggest the significant impact of expertise, trustworthiness, homophily and opinion leadership of the WOM source on the judgement of message quality and the indirect effects on WOM influence mediated by the message quality. The results also indicate the moderating effects of receiver involvement and the valence of the message on the impact of message quality.Practical implications The findings of this paper can inform the strategic development of WOM marketing. A deeper understanding of source characteristics and the role of the message may enable marketing practitioners to better target appropriate influencers for seeding programmes that stimulate WOM communication about their brands or products.Originality/value This study examines how the receiver's evaluations of message content mediate the relationship between source characteristics and WOM influence. Source and message are two elements of communication which are processed when people receive information. However, nascent research examines their effects on each other. This research contributes to the understanding of this relationship through an empirical examination of the direct effects of primary source characteristics on perceived message quality.",
Examining the Connectedness of Connective Action: The Participant-Initiated Facebook Pages in Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,2018,2018,"Contemporary large-scale protest campaigns are often marked by the presence of a wide array of individual- and small-group-based actions initiated by the participants themselves. However, scholars have rarely examined whether and how the participant-initiated actions are connected with each other, whether and how they are connected to the movement leaders, and whether the interconnections among the participant-initiated actions relate to existing divisions within a protest. This study examines 138 participant-initiated Facebook pages established during the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong in 2014. The analysis shows limited connections among the pages on social media, and limited connections between these pages and the leading groups. Nonetheless, pages sharing the same thematic concern were more likely to be connected with each other through page liking and content sharing. Pages sharing the same ideological predilections were more likely to be connected through page liking, yet less likely to be connected through content sharing. Implications of the findings are discussed.",
The impact of biomedical students' ethnicity and gender,EQUALITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION,2018,2018,"Purpose There has been a great deal of research published on the lower success rates of women and underrepresented (UR) students in Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-related (STEM) occupations. For biomedical scientists in particular, many of the obstacles to success occur during graduate training and may be related, at least in part, to certain demographic characteristics (i.e. gender or ethnicity). In particular, women and UR students may be positioned disproportionately into labs with fewer resources and less productive faculty advisors. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach The present study examines the distribution of biomedical science graduate students into research laboratories, based on the gender and ethnicity of both students and faculty advisors. This is archival data that were collected via publicly available information on the internet.Findings Results indicate that female (vs male) students and UR (vs white and Asian) students are paired with advisors who are less successful (i.e. fewer publications, lower h-indices). Additionally, the data show patterns of homophily in that female (vs male) and white and Asian (vs UR) students are more likely to be paired with female and white and Asian advisors, respectively.Originality/value This research uses real-world, archival data to demonstrate that phenomena suggested in previous literature (e.g. less favorable pairings for female and UR students, homophilic pairings) occurs with this specific population.",
Social network analysis and the hunt for homophily: diversity and equality within festival communities,JOURNAL OF POLICY RESEARCH IN TOURISM LEISURE AND EVENTS,2018,2018,"Diversity and equality at a Scottish volunteer-run arts festival are explored in this paper, through a survey-based social network analysis and follow-up interviews. Together they provide an overview of the festival's network structure, and rich evidence of the experiences of individuals in different parts of the network. UCINET software is used to analyse relationships between volunteers, and attribute data based on their demographics, engagement with the festival and responses to Likert-type statements on the study's main themes. Interviewees were sampled as a function of their network centrality, aggregated across a range of measures. A core-periphery network structure was revealed, focused on seven central individuals with established commitments to the organisation. This configuration outweighed alternative arrangements, including the functional departments that interviewees cited as being important to their relationships to the festival. Homophily, the propensity to associate with others with whom we are similar, is explored against status' definitions (such as age and gender) and value' (including beliefs and attitudes). Peripheral interviewees were shown to have less detailed knowledge of the festival's relationships with its neighbourhood, but a clearer sense of how the festival had benefited them personally. Members of the core group were representative of the broader network on a number of attributes apart from the country of birth, with evidence that better communication from core to periphery could benefit the overall organisation in its mission to represent a diverse mix of influences. RESUMENEn este trabajo se exploran la diversidad y la igualdad en un festival de arte voluntario escoces a traves de un estudio basado en el analisis de la red social y entrevistas de seguimiento. Juntos proporcionan una vision de conjunto de la estructura de red del festival, una rica evidencia de las experiencias de los individuos en diferentes partes de la red. Se utiliza el software UCINET para analizar las relaciones entre los voluntarios y atribuir datos basados en sus demograficos, compromiso con el festival y respuestas a afirmaciones tipo Likert sobre los puntos principales del estudio. Los entrevistados fueron muestreados como una funcion de su centralidad en la red, agregado a traves de un conjunto de medidas. Se revelo una estructura de red centro-periferica centrada en siete individuos con compromisos establecidos con la organizacion. Esta configuracion eclipsaba disposciones alternativas incluyendo los departamentos funcionales que los entrevistados citaban como importantes en su relacion con el festival. Se explora la homofilia, la propension a asociarse con otros similares a nosotros, frente a definiciones de estatus' (tales como edad y genero) y valor' (incluyendo creencias y actitudes). Los entrevistados perifericos mostraban tener un conocimiento menos detallado de las relaciones del festival con su vecindario pero un claro sentido de como el festival los beneficiaba a ellos personalmente. Los miembros del grupo principal eran representativos de la red mas amplia en un conjunto de atributos mas alla del pais de nacimiento, con evidencia de que una mejor comunicacion desde el nucleo a la periferia podria beneficiar a la organizacion general en su mision de representar una diversa mezcla de influencias.PALABRAS CLAVESfestival; homofilia; analisis de red social; SNA; diversidad; igualdad; UCINET RESUME travers une analyse de reseaux sociaux basee sur des enquetes et des interviews de suivi, cet article explore la diversite et l'egalite lors d'un festival artistique ecossais de benevolat.

"Understanding Scientific Collaboration: Homophily, Transitivity, and Preferential Attachment",JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Jan 2018,2018,"Scientific collaboration is essential in solving problems and breeding innovation. Coauthor network analysis has been utilized to study scholars' collaborations for a long time, but these studies have not simultaneously taken different collaboration features into consideration. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to analyze the differences in possibilities that two authors will cooperate as seen from the effects of homophily, transitivity, and preferential attachment. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are applied in this research. We find that different types of publications one author has written play diverse roles in his/her collaborations. An author's tendency to form new collaborations with her/his coauthors' collaborators is strong, where the more coauthors one author had before, the more new collaborators he/she will attract. We demonstrate that considering the authors' attributes and homophily effects as well as the transitivity and preferential attachment effects of the coauthorship network in which they are embedded helps us gain a comprehensive understanding of scientific collaboration.",
Untangling the drivers of community cohesion in small-scale fisheries,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS,2018,2018,"Sustainable fisheries require strong management and effective governance. However, small-scale fisheries (SSF) often lack formal institutions, leaving management in the hands of local users in the form of various governance approaches (e.g. local, traditional, or co-management). The effectiveness of these approaches inherently relies upon some level of cohesion among resource users to facilitate agreement on common policies and practices regarding common pool fishery resources. Understanding the factors driving the formation and maintenance of community cohesion in SSF is therefore critical if we are to devise more effective participatory governance approaches and encourage and empower decentralized, localized, and community-based resource management approaches. Here, we adopt a social relational network perspective to propose a suite of hypothesized drivers that lead to the establishment of social ties among fishers that build the foundation for community cohesion. We then draw on detailed data from Jamaica's small-scale fishery to empirically test these drivers by employing a set of nested exponential random graph models (ERGMs) based on specific structural building blocks (i.e. network configurations) theorized to influence the establishment of social ties. Our results demonstrate that multiple drivers are at play, but that collectively, gear-based homophily, geographic proximity, and leadership play particularly important roles. We discuss the extent to which these drivers help explain previous experiences, as well as their implications for future and sustained collective action in SSF in Jamaica and elsewhere.",
Determinants of users' information dissemination behavior on social networking sites: An elaboration likelihood model perspective,INTERNET RESEARCH,2018,2018,"Purpose As a new communication paradigm, social networking sites (SNS) have boosted information diffusion and viral marketing. Prior researchers have identified various factors affecting information dissemination on SNS. However, they often focus on limited factors and there is a lack of an integrated theoretical framework that explains aspects of relevant factors. Besides, the research on the impacts of relationships on individual retweeting behavior is still controversial. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework to systematically investigate the determinants of individual dissemination behavior on SNS based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). Moreover, the authors also examine the relative importance of those relevant factors.Design/methodology/approach The authors randomly selected 1,250 members of Twitter and crawled posts published by each member since he/she created the Twitter account using Twitter API. The authors processed the data to create panel data and tested hypotheses with the panel logit model.Findings Factors both on the central route and on the peripheral route of ELM have positive impacts on individual dissemination behavior. Among them, information receiver-related factor and relationships-related factors are the most influential. Contrastingly, source-related factors are the least influential. Furthermore, the authors find that social tie strength mediates almost 50 percent of the effect of value homophily on individual dissemination behavior.Originality/value The authors are the first to directly apply ELM to examine individual dissemination behavior on SNS. By integrating factors into the two information processing routes, They incorporate relevant factors into the model and systematically analyze their impacts on individual retweeting behavior on SNS. The research offers at least one explanation for the contradictory findings about the effect of homophily on individual sharing behavior in previous research. The authors propose new variables that gauge topical relevance and interpersonal value homophily on SNS.",
Modeling and Simulating the Empathetic Decision-Making Behavior in Social Networks with Homophily,JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY,2018,2018,"People tend to associate with other people whose qualities are similar to their own. This phenomenon is the so-called ""like attracting like"", or the ""homophily"", in social networks. This paper presents a model that simulates how individuals in social networks with homophily make decisions as a result of the empathic effect, which refers to influence by the decisions of friends or the populations of social networks of which they are a member. In this study, experiments were conducted using Monte Carlo simulation to test a particular decision-making preference (such as asking a question in a Facebook group) and Chi-square tests were conducted to see whether the distribution of people's final choices is the same as that of people's intrinsic choices. Experimental results show that under each the following conditions, individuals are less likely to experience the empathic effect, meaning that they are less likely to change their intrinsic choices: (1) the social network exhibits a more homophily; (2) decision-makers have more options from which to choose, and (3) individuals have fewer friends.",
The Influence of Homophilous Interactions on Diversity Effects in Group Problem-Solving,NONLINEAR DYNAMICS PSYCHOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCES,Jan 2018,2018,"Increasingly diversity researchers call for further studies of group micro-processes and dynamics to understand the paradoxical effects of diversity on group performance. In this study, based on analyses of in-group, networked, homophilous interactions, we aim to explain further the effects of diversity on group performance in a parallel problem-solving task, both experimentally and computationally. We developed a ""whodunit"" problem-solving experiment with 116 participants assigned to different-sized groups. Experimental results show that low diversity and high homophily levels are associated with lower performance while the effects of group size are not significant. To investigate this further, we developed an agent-based computational model (ABM), through which we inspected (a) the effect of different homophily and diversity strengths on performance, and (b) the robustness of such effects across group size variations. Overall, modeling results were consistent with our experimental findings, and revealed that the strength of homophily can drive diversity towards a positive or negative impact on performance. We also observed that increasing group size has a very marginal effect. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the implications of diversity in-group problem-solving by providing an integration of both experimental and computational perspectives in the analysis of group processes.",
Models of Opinion Dynamics and Mill-Style Arguments for Opinion Diversity,HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG,2018,2018,"John Stuart Mill advocated for increased interactions between individuals of dissenting opinions for the reason that it would improve society. Whether Mill and similar arguments that advocate for opinion diversity are valid depends on background assumptions about the psychology and sociality of individuals. The field of opinion dynamics is a burgeoning testing ground for how different combinations of sociological and psychological facts contribute to phenomena that affect opinion diversity, such as polarization. This paper applies some recent results from the opinion dynamics literature to assess the impacts of the Millian suggestion. The goal is to understand how the scope of the validity of Mill-style arguments depends on plausible assumptions that can be formalized using agent-based models, a common modeling approach in opinion dynamics. The most salient insight is that homophily (increased interactions between like-minded individuals) does not sufficiently explain decreased opinion diversity. Hence, decreasing homophily by increasing interactions between individuals of dissenting opinions is not the simple solution that a Millian-style argument may advocate.",
DETERMINANTS OF INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL NETWORK FORMATION IN THE CULTURAL SECTOR,RAE-REVISTA DE ADMINISTRACAO DE EMPRESAS,JAN-FEB 2018,2018,"In recent years, the number of studies applying Social Network Analysis to the formation of inter-organizational networks has increased. This paper analyzed a socio-centric network composed of 32 cultural organizations in Andalusia increase. Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure (MR-QAP) at the dyadic level, showed that perceptions of affinity (i.e., homophily) and the possibility of establishing contacts in the future, can exert influence on the establishment of informal contacts. At the internal level, an organization's brokerage position in collaboration project networks is related to the volume of business and the old in the sector. Finally, this article discusses applications for the management of inter-organizational networks in order to strengthen the implementation of public policies,",
"Mirror on the Field: Gender, Authorship, and Research Methods in Higher Education's Leading Journals",JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2018,2018,"Framed conceptually by gender equity, gender homophily, the contest regime of blind peer-review publishing, and the gendered nature of the quantitative-qualitative debate, this study investigated the intersection of authorship, gender, and methodological characteristics of 408 articles published from 2006 to 2010 in 3 major higher education journals. Nonbinary coding of author gender based on pronouns identified via Web searches virtually eliminated missing data and likely reduced error. Results suggest movement toward gender parity over time; however, women's representation among authors does not appear commensurate with representation in the field. Findings revealed gendered use of research methods, with qualitative articles more likely to be first-authored by women and quantitative articles more likely to be first-authored by men. Nevertheless, articles first-authored by both women and men were more likely to use quantitative than qualitative methods. Quantitative research, more so than qualitative research, appears to be a site of cogender collaboration, which has increased over time. This portrait of the intersection of authorship, gender, and research methods provides an empirical foundation for discussion and inquiry about gender and scholarship in the field, and the results of our study are generative for future research.",
Exploring Co-offending Networks by Considering Geographic Background: An Investigation of Electric Bicycle Thefts in Beijing,PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER,2018,2018,"Co-offending refers to illegal activities that are committed by multiple parties together. Little attention has been paid to co-offenders' geographic background when examining co-offender groups. To investigate the impact of geographic homophilous relation on co-offending networks, we analyzed the offender data of electric bicycle thefts in Beijing between 2010 and 2012. Geographic information system and social network analysis methods were used. Three major findings are reported in this article. Most electric bicycle thieves in Beijing are immigrants to the city, and most of them are from a number of clustered places in Central China. Most co-offender groups are formed through inward offending ties, meaning that the co-offenders are from the same town or city; however, for the cross-area co-offenders, the co-offending networks tend to be complex. For the co-offending networks formed by cross-area co-offenders, a few key areas play important roles in the formation of co-offending networks as they supply more and dynamic co-offenders. The findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding and managing co-offending networks for Beijing's electric bicycle thefts.",
Diverse friendship networks and heterogeneous peer effects on adolescent misbehaviors,EDUCATION ECONOMICS,2018,2018,"This study estimates peer effects in diverse friendship networks by friend types. Evidence from friendship networks for 57,351 U.S. high school adolescents demonstrates that adolescents are more likely to make friends with someone of the same immigrant status or ethnicity ('similar friends') than those with different backgrounds ('dissimilar friends') and they interact more with their similar friends. Both types of friends influence adolescents' misbehaviors of smoking and drinking; yet similar friends have greater influences. Various potential mechanisms are contested, and the results suggest that higher interactions with similar friends can explain the heterogeneous peer effects.",
A Micro-Foundation of Social Capital in Evolving Social Networks,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,JAN-MAR 2018,2018,"A social network confers benefits and advantages on individuals (and on groups); the literature refers to these benefits and advantages as social capital. An individual's social capital depends on its position in the network and on the shape of the network-but positions in the network and the shape of the network are determined endogenously and change as the network forms and evolves. This paper presents a micro-founded mathematical model of the evolution of a social network and of the social capital of individuals within the network. The evolution of the network and of social capital are driven by exogenous and endogenous processes-entry, meeting, linking-that have both random and deterministic components. These processes are influenced by the extent to which individuals are homophilic (prefer others of their own type), structurally opportunistic (prefer neighbors of neighbors to strangers), socially gregarious (desire more or fewer connections) and by the distribution of types in the society. In the analysis, we identify different kinds of social capital: bonding capital refers to links to others; popularity capital refers to links from others; bridging capital refers to connections between others. We show that each form of capital plays a different role and is affected differently by the characteris tics of the society. Bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections; homophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connections more homogeneous. Popularity capital leads to preferential attachment: individuals who become popular tend to become more and more popular because others are more likely to link to them. Homophily creates inequality in the popularity capital attained by different social categories; more gregarious types of agents are more likely to become popular. However, in homophilic societies, individuals who belong to less gregarious, less opportunistic, or major types are likely to be more central in the network and thus acquire a bridging capital. And, while extreme homophily maximizes an individual's bonding capital, it also creates structural holes in the network, which hinder the exchange of ideas and information across social categories. Such structural holes represent a potential source of bridging capital: non-homophilic (tolerant or open-minded) individuals can fill these holes and broker interactions at the interface between different social categories.",
Recommender’s Personal Influence in the Context of Curation Service: Focusing on the interaction effect between regulatory focus and recommender’s homophily cue,The Korean Journal of Consumer and Advertising Psychology,2018,2018,"There have been two different theories which result in conflicting predictions regarding the influence of homogeneous and heterogeneous recommenders. While homophily principle emphasizes the importance of a homogeneous recommender, diffusion model argues vice versa. The present study tried to integrate these two theories especially in the context of social curation service. Regulatory focus is suggested as a moderator variable which moderates the effect of recommenders’ homophily cue on information seeking intention in the short and long terms, and their personal influence. An experiment was conducted in order to test the hypotheses. The result generally supported homophily principle. However, there was a significant interaction effect between recommenders’ homophily cue and participants’ regulatory focus. As hypotheses expected, the promotion focused group sought heterogeneous recommenders more often compared to the prevention focused group did. Moreover, promotion focused participants preferred recommendations given by heterogeneous recommenders over homogeneous recommenders. They also reported higher intention to accept heterogeneous recommenders’ recommendations. The prevention focused group, on the other hand, reported preference and higher intention to accept homogeneous recommenders’ recommendations over that of heterogeneous recommenders. Theoretical and practical implications were further discussed.",
Gender Identification via Reposting Behaviors in Social Media,IEEE ACCESS,2018,2018,"Social media has drawn scientists' attention due to their potential values for health and marketing, among other activities. To effectively exploit such huge online resources by using incomplete user profiles, which are very common on social media sites and can be caused by user privacy settings, it is meaningful to explore user profile identification methods. In this paper, we focus on gender identification using reposting behaviors on social networks. Whereas most existing works rely on pure statistical methods, we propose a scheme that is underpinned by homophily and four intuitive methods based on it by combining knowledge of statistics and sociology. For our data set, which was obtained from Sina Weibo and contained 1039 test samples and 528k user profiles, our methods perform with 86.7% accuracy. We explore the sensitivity of our methods on the scale of the data set and find surprisingly competitive results surpassing the binary classification baseline. Finally, we further suggest possible extensions to our methods.",
Investigating the online social network development through the Five Cs Model of Similarity The Facebook case,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE,2018,2018,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of five dimensions of similarity (i.e. condition similarity, context similarity, catalyst similarity, consequence similarity and connection similarity) on Facebook social networks development.Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based survey was conducted with 245 Romanian college students. SmartPLS 3 statistical software for partial least squares structural equation modeling was chosen as the most adequate technique for the assessment of models with both composites and reflective constructs.Findings - More than 52 percent of the variance in social network development was explained by the advanced similarity model. Each dimension had a positive effect on Facebook social networks development, the highest influences being exerted by condition similarity, context similarity and consequence similarity.Research limitations/implications - The current approach is substantively based on the homophily paradigm in explaining social network development. Future research would benefit from comparing and contrasting complementary theories (e.g. the rational self-interest paradigm, the social exchange or dependency theories) with the current findings. Also, the research is tributary to a convenience-based sample of Romanian college students which limits the generalization of the results to other cultural contexts and, thus, invites further research initiatives to test the model in different settings.Social implications - Similarity attributes and mechanisms consistently determine the dynamics of online social networks, a fact which should be investigated in depth in terms of the impact of new technologies among young people.Originality/value - This study is among the first research initiatives to approach similarity structures and processes within an integrative framework and to conduct the empirical analysis beyond US-centric samples.",
"Rural Social Networks along Amazonian Rivers: Seeds, Labor and Soccer among Communities on the Napo River, Peru",GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW,Jan 2018,2018,"Research on Amazonian communities has focussed more often on rural-urban linkages than on links among rural communities. This is unsurprising, given the low density of population, limited intercommunity commerce, and importance of direct city-market relations. Social relations among rural communities are also important in shaping rural livelihoods and lifeways. We report on the findings of a large-scale census of communities in the Napo River basin in northeastern Peru (n=174). Data were gathered on intervillage crop seed acquisition and cooperative labor sharing as two key inputs in agriculture, and on intervillage soccer matches, which are integral to rural social life. We analyze the socio-spatial networks of each practice, paying attention to settlement patterns, community ethnicity, and differential access to the uplands. We find that seeds and labor flow along soccer network lines. Rural social networks appear to be structured strongly by ethnicity (homophily) and reflect important complementarities between upland and lowland communities (weak ties).",
Who Persuades Who? An Analysis of Persuasion Choices Related to Antibiotic-Free Food,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2018,2018,"Personal communication, in which one person persuades another to engage in a particular behavior, is one means through which behaviors spread. To better understand how personal communication spreads behavior, we investigated adults' (N=228) likelihood of persuading others in a fictitious social network to buy antibiotic-free food, and who they attempted to persuade, based on behavioral determinants, homophily, and superdiffuser traits. For potential consumers, the findings showed that behavioral determinants, behavioral intentions, and mavenism predicted intentions to persuade others. Homophily, mavenism, and connectivity predicted patterns of interpersonal persuasion. For vegetarians (without homophily in action), behavioral determinants and mavenism predicted persuasion intentions. Persuasiveness was associated with targeting more network members; mavenism was associated with selecting structurally central members.",
Political conversations on Facebook. Exploring the role of homophily in argumentation and communicative interaction,REVISTA LATINA DE COMUNICACION SOCIAL,2018,2018,"Research on online political talk has been overwhelmingly influenced by deliberative theory, as a result of the big hopes originally placed on the Internet capacity to revolutionize politics. However, two decades of empirical research point out that these informal communicative interactions hardly resemble deliberative ideals. In this study, we explore if Facebook contributors who share ideological stances are more likely to a) justify their points of view and b) interact with each other. We apply content analysis to a sample of 2,800 comments published on the Facebook walls of the four mayor Spanish political parties during General Election campaign 2015. Findings show that homophily is negatively related to both argumentation and interaction. It is the outsiders who are much more likely to reason their opinions, while it is those who hold neutral views who are more inclined towards interaction [1].",
"Empirical analysis of structural properties, macroscopic and microscopic evolution of various Facebook activity networks",QUALITY & QUANTITY,Jan 2018,2018,"Recently, some works have been done in studying activity network as a more realistic representation of users' behavior in online social networks. However, there is a major deficiency of a suitable definition of activity network based on a comprehensive study of various activity networks separately and combined. The main purpose of our research is to understand the differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities, so as to claim that these networks should not be blindly composed; neither should the result of analyzing each of them individually be generalized to others. For this purpose, degree distribution, small-world phenomenon, degree correlation, reciprocity, and homophily by different attributes of various activity networks are studied. Then, we study densification and shrinking diameter properties and some structural characteristics of activity networks over time. We also examine microscopic evolution of different activity networks. Ultimately, we conclude that there are some differences between users' behavior by various Facebook activities but all evolve almost similarly at macroscopic and microscopic levels. However, post network evolves considerably different from other activity networks. Accordingly, a comprehensive definition for activity network is suggested so that the results of analyzing the modeled activity network fit realistic data.",
No place like home: Opinion formation with homophily and implications for policy decisions,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY,2018,2018,"We set up an opinion diffusion model with a local opinion leader, and using simulations we show the possibility of driving a significant wedge between the opinions of two groups that exhibit homophily although individuals are highly conformist. There exists an opinion gap between the group to which the opinion leader belongs and the other group. This opinion gap increases according to the relative size of the residence community. We show empirical traits related to our simulation: Employing Swiss national referenda data from 2008 to 2012, we show that members of parliament match referenda outcomes in their residence communities closer than they do in neighboring communities and that this wedge interacts significantly with the relative size of the residence community.",
Paths of Recruitment: Rational Social Prospecting in Petition Canvassing,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,Jan 2018,2018,"Petition canvassers are political recruiters. Building upon the rational prospector model, we theorize that rational recruiting strategies are dynamic (Bayesian and time-conscious), spatial (constrained by geography), and social (conditioned on relations between canvasser and prospect). Our theory predicts that canvassers will exhibit homophily in their canvassing preferences and will alternate between ""door-to-door"" and ""attractor"" (working in a central location) strategies based upon systematic geographical variation. They will adjust their strategies midstream (mid-petition) based upon experience. Introducing methods to analyze canvassing data, we test these hypotheses on geocoded signatory lists from two petition drivesa 2005-6 anti-Iraq War initiative in Wisconsin and an 1839 antislavery campaign in New York City. Canvassers in these campaigns exhibited homophily to the point of following geographically and politically ""inefficient"" paths. In the aggregate, these patterns may exacerbate political inequality, limiting political involvement of the poorer and less educated.",
Efficacy of MBA: on the role of network effects in influencing the selection of elective courses,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT,2018,2018,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to outline the importance of social network effects in influencing the elective (courses) selection among masters of business administration (MBA) students and its role in influencing the efficacy of MBA. As such, given the enormous time and investment required for students to pursue an MBA and the role of electives in forming the student's knowledge base, it is important to consider the decision process of students while selecting elective courses as they pursue their degree.Design/methodology/approach - This study explores the relevance of network characteristics in the elective selection phenomena through questionnaires administered personally to 50 MBA students from a premier b-school in India. Thereby, it seeks to link the implications with MBA efficacy.Findings - In the sample, the authors found that social network connections in terms of homophily and heterophily (similar and dissimilar others) had the strongest association with elective course decisions. Further, the role of tie strength (the level of intensity of the social relationship between two individuals) in governing the phenomena was not confirmed.Practical implications - The authors discuss the linkage of elective selection phenomena with the efficacy of MBA. Specifically, the authors focus on a possible risk where network influences may prompt a student to select electives by surpassing his or her academic interests and thereby may hamper the efficacy. The authors also outline implications from the perspective of students, professors, and administrators.Originality/value - The study is among the initial studies to present preliminary evidence on the efficacy of MBA from the perspective of elective selection phenomena and the role of social network effects.",
Human capital of entrepreneurial teams in nascent high-tech sectors: a comparison between Cleantech and Internet,TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT,2018,2018,"We use an inductive approach to understand what types of founders' human capital, at individual and team levels, are necessary to recognise and exploit entrepreneurial opportunities. A sample of 195 founders who teamed up in the nascent phases of Cleantech and Interned-based sectors is analysed. The results suggest a twofold moderating effect of the sectoral context. First, a more hard science-based and complex sector like Cleantech demands technically more skilled entrepreneurs, but at the same time, it still requires fairly commercially experienced and economically competent individuals. Furthermore, the business context also appears to exert an important influence on team formation dynamics: individuals are more prone to team-up with cofounders possessing complementary know-how when they are starting a new business venture in the Cleantech rather than in the Internet-based sector. Overall, these results stress the role of the specific high-tech business context at stake when analysing entrepreneurial team composition patterns.",
Americans are more exposed to difference than we think: Capturing hidden exposure to political and racial difference,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2018,2018,Use of name generators (NG) in assessing exposure to political difference has led to the conclusion that disagreement is uncommon. Data from two representative surveys tested a NG modification to probe for exposure to difference. Over half for whom NG results suggest no exposure to difference were able to name an alter who supported an alternative candidate. Over a quarter whose NG results indicate no exposure to a racial difference were able to name someone of the opposite race with whom they'd talked politics. These findings demonstrate that mixed or diverse networks are more common than prior NG research suggests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,
A new look at clustering coefficients with generalization to weighted and multi-faction networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2018,2018,"In this paper we propose a new method for studying local and global clustering in networks employing random walk pairs. The method is intuitive and directly generalizes standard local and global clustering coefficients to weighted networks and networks containing nodes of multiple types. In the case of two mode networks the values obtained for commonly considered social networks are in sharp contrast to those obtained, for instance, by the method of Opsahl (2013), and provide a different viewpoint for clustering. The approach is also applicable in questions related to the general study of segregation and homophily. Applications to existent data sets are considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"Network Environments and Well-Being: An Examination of Personal Network Structure, Social Capital, and Perceived Social Support",HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2018,2018,"Previous studies have demonstrated the role of social networks, social capital, and social support in individuals' well-being. However, the ways in which these related constructs simultaneously influence one's well-being outcomes and relate to one another have not been closely examined. This study pays particular attention to the structural characteristics of personal networks, distinction between offline and online social capital, and different indicators of well-being outcomes. Based on survey data collected from 574 college students, the study found that two dimensions of personal networksdensity and gender homophilyand social capital in the form of offline bonding capital explained perceived social support. Further, perceived social support consistently predicted well-being outcomes and played a mediating role between personal network density and well-being, as well as between offline bonding capital and well-being. The results offer implications for a more nuanced understanding of the role of individuals' interpersonal and social environments in well-being outcomes.",

Dating across and hooking 'up': Status and relationship formation at an elite liberal arts university,DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH,Dec 14 2017,2017,"BACKGROUNDDemographic research on assortative mating underplays the role of social status in shaping partnering behavior, yet qualitative research suggests social status is critical in shaping partner desirability and structuring opportunities for partners to meet.OBJECTIVEThis study investigates how social status of sororities and fraternities shapes relationship formation between women and men on a college campus.METHODSWe draw on data from an online survey of sorority women at an elite liberal arts university about their romantic and sexual lives.RESULTSWhile status homophily is the dominant pattern in romantic relationships (dating 'across'), sorority women up and down the status hierarchy are more likely to hook 'up' with high-status fraternity men. Concern about status is also associated with dating and hooking 'up' the status hierarchy.CONCLUSIONSSocial status shapes the desirability of potential romantic and hookup partners and opportunities for potential partners to meet. Results also highlight gender differences in the operation of social status in cross-sex relationship formation.",

Racial Inequities in HIV Prevalence and Composition of Risk Networks Among People Who Inject Drugs in HIV Prevention Trial Network 037,JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES,Dec 1 2017,2017,"Background: HIV prevention interventions in the United States have failed to eliminate racial inequities. Here, we evaluate factors associated with racial inequities in HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs using HIV Prevention Trial Network 037 data.Methods: We measured racial homophily (ie, all members share the same race), being in an HIV+ network (network with >= 1 HIV+ member), and drug and sex risk behaviors. A 2-level logistic regression with a random intercept evaluated the association between being in an HIV+ network and race adjusting for individual-level and network-level factors.Results: Data from 232 index participants and 464 network members were included in the analysis. Racial homophily was high among blacks (79%) and whites (70%); 27% of all-black, 14% of all-white, and 23% of racially mixed networks included HIV+ members. Sex risk was similar across networks, but needle sharing was significantly lower in all-black (23%) compared with all-white (48%) and racially mixed (46%) networks. All-black [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4 to 9.5] and racially mixed (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1 to 3.7) networks were more likely to include HIV+ network members; other factors associated with being in HIV+ network included homelessness (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.2), recent incarceration (AOR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.7), and cocaine injection (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7). Risk behaviors were not associated with being in an HIV+ network.Conclusion: Despite having lower drug risk behavior, all-black networks disproportionately included HIV+ members. HIV prevention interventions for people who inject drugs need to go beyond individual risk and consider the composition of risk networks.",
Rationalization and identification of binary games with correlated types,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,Dec 2017,2017,"This paper studies the rationalization and identification of binary games where players have correlated private types. Allowing for type correlation is crucial in global games and in models with social interactions as it represents correlated private information and homophily, respectively. Our approach Is fully nonparametric in the joint distribution of types and the strategic effects in the payoffs. First, under monotone pure Bayesian Nash Equilibrium strategy, we characterize all the restrictions if any on the distribution of players' choices imposed by the game-theoretic model as well as restrictions associated with two assumptions frequently made in the empirical analysis of discrete games. Namely, we consider exogeneity of payoff shifters relative to private information, and mutual independence of private information given payoff shifters. Second, we study the nonparametric identification of the payoff functions and types distribution. We show that the model with exogenous payoff shifters is fully identified up to a single location-scale normalization under some exclusion restrictions and rank conditions. Third, we discuss partial identification under weaker conditions and multiple equilibria. Lastly, we briefly point out the implications of our results for model testing and estimation.

Clustering by Well-Being in Workplace Social Networks: Homophily and Social Contagion,EMOTION,Dec 2017,2017,"Social interaction among employees is crucial at both an organizational and individual level. Demonstrating the value of recent methodological advances, 2 studies conducted in 2 workplaces and 2 countries sought to answer the following questions: (a) Do coworkers interact more with coworkers who have similar well-being? and, if yes, (b) what are the processes by which such affiliation occurs? Affiliation was assessed via 2 methodologies: a commonly used self-report measure (i.e., mutual nominations by coworkers) complemented by a behavioral measure (i.e., sociometric badges that track physical proximity and social interaction). We found that individuals who share similar levels of well-being (e.g., positive affect, life satisfaction, need satisfaction, and job satisfaction) were more likely to socialize with one another. Furthermore, time-lagged analyses suggested that clustering in need satisfaction arises from mutual attraction (homophily), whereas clustering in job satisfaction and organizational prosocial behavior results from emotional contagion. These results suggest ways in which organizations can physically and socially improve their workplace.",
IN THE BEGINNING: IDENTITY PROCESSES AND ORGANIZING IN MULTI-FOUNDER NASCENT VENTURES,ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Dec 1 2017,2017,"We conducted a longitudinal field study of nine nascent ventures attempting to revitalize local municipalities to understand how and why identity processes shape organizing in multi-founder nascent ventures. We develop grounded theory and a process model showing how the patterning of founders' social and role identities shapes early structuring processes, how this in turn influences the construction of a collective identity prototype and its attempted enforcement by an in-group, and how the overall process influences whether or not founders remain engaged in their joint organizing efforts. In some cases, founders' identities adjust as they experience periods of pragmatic deference, contestation, and domination by an in-group that moves increasingly toward identity homophily. Our contributions extend the growing entrepreneurship literature on founder identity from an individual focus toward understanding how founding teams work through organizing issues, and from a focus on established organizations to exploring why and whether teams move forward in nascent ventures. We open up a series of important questions for future research about how founders become ""who we are.""",
Self-Organizing Into Winning Teams: Understanding the Mechanisms That Drive Successful Collaborations,SMALL GROUP RESEARCH,Dec 2017,2017,"Contemporary teams are self-assembling with increasing frequency, meaning the component members are choosing to join forces with some degree of agency rather than being assigned to work with one another. However, the majority of the teams literature up until this point has focused on randomly assigned or staffed teams. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to investigate how people do form into teams and how people should form into teams. Specifically, we utilized a sample of digital traces from a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (N = 1,568) to evaluate the bases for and performance implications of team self-assembly. The results indicated that self-assembled teams form via three mechanisms: homophily, familiarity, and proximity. Moreover, results of the trace data analyses indicated that successful and unsuccessful teams were homogeneous in terms of different characteristics, and successful teams formed based on friendship more often than unsuccessful teams did.",
Social streaming? Navigating music as personal and social,CONVERGENCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH INTO NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES,Dec 2017,2017,"Music-streaming services embed social features that enable users to connect to one another and use music as social objects. This article examines how these features are experienced within negotiations of music as personal and social through the acts of sharing music and of following others. The analysis relies on 23 focus-group interviews with 124 Spotify and/or Tidal users and a mixed-method study including music-diary self-reports, online observation and interviews with 12 heavy users. Our findings suggest that users incorporate social awareness in non-sharing, selective-sharing and all-sharing approaches with strong, weak and absent ties. These ties are characterized by different configurations of social and music homophily. Negotiations of music as personal and social shape how music-streaming services are experienced.",
Making and Keeping Friends: The Importance of Being Similar,CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES,Dec 2017,2017,"Similarity is central to friendship. The origins of homophily (love of the same) between friends are varied, but they all serve the same purpose: fostering compatibility and maintaining the rewards of affiliation. Interpersonal attraction is grounded on similarity. Similar individuals have much in common and find it easy to get along. Friends are selected on the basis of resemblances and friends influence one another to become more similar over time. Friends also resist changes that promote dissimilarity because differences increase the risk that the friendship will dissolve. Similarity is an essential feature of friendship at all stages of life, but it assumes special significance during adolescence when changes in autonomy coincide with changes in the social world to raise the profile of friends.",
Do individuals with maladaptive personality traits find these same traits desirable in potential romantic partners?,PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES,Dec 1 2017,2017,"Individuals are generally attracted to other people with similar personality traits, but it is unclear whether these patterns replicate for maladaptive personality traits. Accordingly, we examined the association between individuals' own maladaptive personality traits and how desirable they found those traits in a potential romantic partner (N = 334). As hypothesized, individuals with higher levels of maladaptive personality traits rated those traits as being more desirable in a romantic partner. However, the mean desirability ratings of individuals with higher levels of maladaptive traits indicated that they rated these traits as less undesirable than the average participant but not actually desirable. These results suggest that the positive overall associations may reflect these individuals being more willing to settle for these less desirable partners rather than actively seeking them out. Further research examining the mechanisms underlying these patterns and how these choices play out in real world contexts would be valuable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Modelling socially-influenced conditional preferences over feature values in recommender systems based on factorised collaborative filtering,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Nov 30 2017,2017,"Recommender systems have gained much attention due to their great commercial benefits in electronic markets. The quality of the recommendations depends on the quality of the preference model extracted by the recommender system. Recently, latent factor models based on probabilistic matrix factorisation have gained much attention, owing to their superior accuracy over traditional recommender systems and their great efficiency. Although latent factor models are very efficient, they mostly ignore the user preferences over different item feature values. For example, they assume that lower prices are preferred by all users. However, there may be users who believe that a high price comes with better quality or more prestige. Furthermore, according to homophily and social influence in social sciences, similar users in a social network tend to acquire similar tastes through social interactions. Therefore, all components of human preferences including feature value discrepancies are subject to social influence. Moreover, most of the latent factor models ignore the possible dependencies that naturally exist between item features. To tackle these problems, in this paper we propose two novel latent factor models incorporating socially influenced feature value discrepancies, and socially-influenced conditional feature value discrepancies. We test the accuracy of the proposed methods on three well-known benchmark datasets. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher accuracies than all state of the art traditional, latent factor, and social recommendation models.

"Class attendance, peer similarity, and academic performance in a large field study",PLOS ONE,Nov 8 2017,2017,"Identifying the factors that determine academic performance is an essential part of educational research. Existing research indicates that class attendance is a useful predictor of subsequent course achievements. The majority of the literature is, however, based on surveys and self-reports, methods which have well-known systematic biases that lead to limitations on conclusions and generalizability as well as being costly to implement. Here we propose a novel method for measuring class attendance that overcomes these limitations by using location and bluetooth data collected from smartphone sensors. Based on measured attendance data of nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, we demonstrate that early and consistent class attendance strongly correlates with academic performance. In addition, our novel dataset allows us to determine that attendance among social peers was substantially correlated (>0.5), suggesting either an important peer effect or homophily with respect to attendance.",
"Happy Tourists, Unhappy Locals",SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH,Nov 2017,2017,"The most recent of literature focuses more often on the happiness of tourists, rather than the happiness of residents affected by tourism. However, this study aims at filling this gap with a new and refreshing perspective. This is carried out by using the European Social Survey (2010-2012) merged with Eurostat tourism data at the province (NUTS2) level. Staying consistent with homophily or ingroup preference theories, we find that domestic tourists contribute more to the happiness of locals than foreign tourists. Also by staying consistent with Irridex theory, we find that tourism at low levels of development contributes more to happiness than tourism at a high level of development.",
"Beyond ""birds of a feather"": A social inference approach to attachment-dependent grouping",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2017,2017,"Homophily-social grouping on the basis of similar traits-is a well-established intergroup dynamic. However, some evidence suggests that homophily emerges as a byproduct of people's inferences about desirable qualities (e.g. trustworthiness, openness to experience) in others. We apply this social inference approach to studying how people form groups on the basis of their attachment styles. In a behavioral tracking study involving large samples of strangers interacting in a sports stadium, we found that people affiliate with others who share their degree of attachment avoidance, but who do not share their degree of attachment anxiety. These findings are consistent with evidence that avoidantly attached individuals but-not anxiously attached individuals-display qualities they find desirable in others. It also suggests that accounts of intergroup behavior and social identity that treat similarity as an interpersonal goal might not capture the psychological processes behind group formation, and that a more nuanced social inference approach is needed to explain large-scale patterns of social grouping.",
Gender and racial peer effects with endogenous network formation,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,Nov 2017,2017,"We apply a high order spatial autoregressive (SAR) model to simultaneously capture'heterogeneous peer effects from multiple gender and racial groups, as well as endogenous network formation. In students' GPA and smoking behaviors, we find that within-gender endogenous effects are stronger than cross-gender effects. Females and whites are more sensitive to peer influences and more influential than other students. Intra-race spillover effects are stronger than inter-race effects for whites, but not for non-whites. Homophily on observed and unobserved characteristics are important for friendship formation. However, the formation of friendship is not necessary motivated by common interest in outcomes such as smoking. Our findings suggest that coeducational or desegregated schooling may help increase academic achievement, but not reduce smoking frequency.",
Information Connections among Multiple Investors: Evolutionary Local Patterns Revealed by Motifs,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Oct 25 2017,2017,"The concept of motifs provides a fresh perspective for studying local patterns, which is useful for understanding the essence of a network structure. However, few previous studies have focused on the evolutionary characteristics of weighted motifs while further considering participants' differences. We study how information connections differ among multiple investors. The evolutionary 10-year trend of weighted 3-motifs in China's energy stock markets is explored for the networks of co-holding behaviors among shareholders, who are classified as companies, funds and individuals. Our works allow us to detect the preferential local patterns distributed among different agents as their fluctuate involvement in networks. We find that the diversity of shareholders contributes to the statistical significance of local patterns, while homophily always exist among individuals. Modules of information connections are stable among reserved investors, which is especially apparent among companies. Individuals prefer to keep their connections with companies and funds. Unsteady modules happen owing to strengthen links among funds during the time that they are main participants in stock markets. More details about multiple investors informationally connected in evolutionary local patterns can be detected by our work.",
Examining the Social Context of Injection Drug Use: Social Proximity to Persons Who Inject Drugs Versus Geographic Proximity to Persons Who Inject Drugs,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,Oct 15 2017,2017,"In this analysis, we used social network and spatial data to examine associations between people's drug injection status and their social and/or spatial proximity to others who injected drugs. We recruited 503 rural Kentucky residents who used drugs to participate in the Social Networks among Appalachian People (SNAP) Study (2008-2010). Interviewer-administered surveys collected information on recent (past 6 months) sex, drug-use, and social-support network members (n = 897 ties). Using network simulations, we determined a threshold for the association between social proximity to others who injected drugs and recent injection status (""socially proximal"" was defined by a shortest path = 2). We defined ""geographically proximal"" as the median road-network distance between pairs of individuals who both injected drugs (<= 7 miles (<= 11.2 km)). Logistic regression was used to determine the independent and joint associations between the number of socially and/or geographically proximal injecting peers and a person's injection status. After adjustment, the odds of recent injection increased by 0.4% for each injecting peer who was geographically proximal but not socially proximal, 12% for each geographically and socially proximal injecting peer, and 22% for each injecting peer who was socially proximal but not geographically proximal. When implementing networkbased interventions which promote cessation of injection drug use, investigators should consider collecting sociometric network data to examine whether the intervention diffuses through the network and whether there are additive or threshold effects.",
Building trust networks in the absence of trust relations,FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING,Oct 2017,2017,"User-specified trust relations are often very sparse and dynamic, making them difficult to accurately predict from online social media. In addition, trust relations are usually unavailable for most social media platforms. These issues pose a great challenge for predicting trust relations and further building trust networks. In this study, we investigate whether we can predict trust relations via a sparse learning model, and propose to build a trust network without trust relations using only pervasively available interaction data and homophily effect in an online world. In particular, we analyze the reliability of predicting trust relations by interaction behaviors, and provide a principled way to mathematically incorporate interaction behaviors and homophily effect in a novel framework, bTrust. Results of experiments on real-world datasets from Epinions and Ciao demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments were conducted to understand the importance of interaction behaviors and homophily effect in building trust networks.",
"My friend far, far away: a random field approach to exponential random graph models",ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL,Oct 2017,2017,"We explore the asymptotic properties of strategic models of network formation in very large populations. Specifically, we focus on (undirected) exponential random graph models. We want to recover a set of parameters from the individuals' utility functions using the observation of a single, but large, social network. We show that, under some conditions, a simple logit-based estimator is coherent, consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under a weak version of homophily. The approach is compelling as the computing time is minimal and the estimator can be easily implemented using pre-programmed estimators available in most statistical packages. We provide an application of our method using the Add Health database.",
Social and spatial effects on genetic variation between foraging flocks in a wild bird population,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Oct 2017,2017,"Social interactions are rarely random. In some instances, animals exhibit homophily or heterophily, the tendency to interact with similar or dissimilar conspecifics, respectively. Genetic homophily and heterophily influence the evolutionary dynamics of populations, because they potentially affect sexual and social selection. Here, we investigate the link between social interactions and allele frequencies in foraging flocks of great tits (Parus major) over three consecutive years. We constructed co-occurrence networks which explicitly described the splitting and merging of 85,602 flocks through time (fission-fusion dynamics), at 60 feeding sites. Of the 1,711 birds in those flocks, we genotyped 962 individuals at 4,701 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). By combining genomewide genotyping with repeated field observations of the same individuals, we were able to investigate links between social structure and allele frequencies at a much finer scale than was previously possible. We explicitly accounted for potential spatial effects underlying genetic structure at the population level. We modelled social structure and spatial configuration of great tit fission-fusion dynamics with eigenvector maps. Variance partitioning revealed that allele frequencies were strongly affected by group fidelity (explaining 27%-45% of variance) as individuals tended to maintain associations with the same conspecifics. These conspecifics were genetically more dissimilar than expected, shown by genomewide heterophily for pure social (i.e., space-independent) grouping preferences. Genomewide homophily was linked to spatial configuration, indicating spatial segregation of genotypes. We did not find evidence for homophily or heterophily for putative socially relevant candidate genes or any other SNP markers. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing social and spatial processes in determining population structure.",
To Whom Do Prior Offenders Pose a Risk? Victim-Offender Similarity in Police-Reported Violent Crime,CRIME & DELINQUENCY,Oct 2017,2017,"This study assessed whether the higher risk of victimization among criminally active and socially disadvantaged individuals is related to violent incidents including offenders with criminal backgrounds. The analysis is based on a Finnish general population sample (N = 69,635) using a 7-year-follow-up of police-reported violent incidents that enabled the measurement of criminal background of the ""outside-sample"" opposite parties involved in the incidents. The association between socioeconomic/criminal background and victimization grew stronger by the intensity of the criminal background of the offender. The results indicate that the risk posed by prior offenders is disproportionally targeted toward criminally active and disadvantaged individuals.",
From triadic closure to conference closure: the role of academic conferences in promoting scientific collaborations,SCIENTOMETRICS,Oct 2017,2017,"An academic conference is not only a venue for publishing papers but also a nursery room for new scientific encounters. While previous research has investigated scientific collaboration mechanisms based on the triadic closure and focal closure, in this paper, we propose a new collaboration mechanism named conference closure. Conference closure means that scholars involved in a common conference may collaborate with each other in the future. We analyze the extent to which scholars will meet new collaborators from both the individual and community levels by using 22 conferences in the field of data mining extracted from DBLP digital library. Our results demonstrate the existence of conference closure and this phenomenon is more remarkable in conferences with high field rating and large scale attendees. Scholars involved in multiple conferences will encounter more collaborators from the conferences. Another interesting finding is that although most conference attendees are junior scholars with few publications, senior scholars with fruitful publications may gain more collaborations during the conference. Meanwhile, the conference closure still holds if we control the productivity homophily. Our study will shed light on evaluating the impact of a conference from the social function perspective based on the index of conference closure.",
Is the housing market blind to religion? A perceived substitutability approach to homophily and social integration,URBAN STUDIES,Oct 2017,2017,"Housing markets are unlikely to be impervious to the preferences and prejudices associated with urban segregation. For example, two neighbourhoods with very different religious attributes are unlikely to be perceived as close substitutes by homebuyers that have a strong preference for neighbours of a particular religion. This paper offers a new framework for the conception and measurement of social integration, defined in terms of perceived homophily. Homophily is the tendency for links to form between similar nodes in a network and we can think of perceived homophily as the tendency for any pair of neighbourhoods to be considered by the housing market to be close substitutes. Textbook economic theory suggests that we should expect the degree of perceived substitutability to affect cross-price elasticities. These can be measured empirically to reveal discontinuities in the network of perceived substitutability of different housing locations. Applying homophily coefficients to substitutability measures allows us to estimate perceived religious homophily between neighbourhoods. The approach can be applied to any city or region that has geocoded house transactions and socio-demographic data. We illustrate the method using data on Glasgow and find strong evidence of religious homophily. This suggests an underlying lack of social integration/cohesion and implies that the Glaswegian housing market is by no means blind to religion.",
Neighborhood isolation in Chicago: Violent crime effects on structural isolation and homophily in inter-neighborhood commuting networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2017,2017,"Urban sociologists and, criminologists have long been interested in the link between neighborhood isolation and crime. Yet studies have focused predominantly on the internal dimension of social isolation (i.e., increased social disorganization and insufficient jobs and opportunities). This study highlights the need to assess the external dimension of neighborhood isolation, the disconnectedness from other neighbor-hoods in the city. Analyses of Chicago's neighborhood commuting network over twelve years (2002-2013) showed that violence predicted network isolation. Moreover, pairwise similarity in neighborhood violence predicted commuting ties, supporting homophily expectations. Violence homophily affected tie formation most, while neighborhood violence was important in dissolving ties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
At the intersection of criminal justice involvement and sexual orientation: Dynamic networks and health among a population-based sample of young Black men who have sex with men,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2017,2017,"Mass incarceration of young Black men has a significant impact on their network composition and stability that, in turn, may have major implications for health and well-being. A sub-group of young Black men with criminal justice involvement (CJI) identify as gay, bisexual or are non-identified men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM). This paper focuses on the potential effects of CJI on the composition of Black MSM social and sexual networks, their stability over time, and concomitant health and social outcomes. We use data from the UConnect study, a population-based cohort of young Black MSM 16-29 years of age (n = 618) selected using respondent -driven sampling in Chicago from 2013 to 2016. Both confidant and sexual network name generators and interpreters were administered at 9-month intervals over three waves of data collection. Ego and dyadic-level data were collected on behaviors prevalent among MSM and including factors associated with network CJI, network stability, and health outcomes. Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEM) were utilized to determine the relationship between CJI network composition, network stability and behaviors prevalent among young Black MSM and their networks. In the UConnect cohort, 46% had at least once been detained, arrested or spent time in jail or prison. In addition, 20% of participants reported incident CJI over the study period. Respondents with a history of CJI were significantly more likely to have CJI homophily in their confidant and sexual networks. Multivariate analyses demonstrate that the association between one's history of CJI, housing instability and drug use is partially explained by one's network CJI. In addition, a higher prevalence of network CJI is associated with increased turnover in the confidant network, and this network instability is also related to important health and social outcomes. This analysis describes the networks of criminal justice involved men among a representative sample of young Black MSM and demonstrates the relationship between CJI network homophily, network stability and their impact on several key health and social outcomes relevant to this population.

DANCer: dynamic attributed networks with community structure generation,KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Oct 2017,2017,"Most networks, such as those generated from social media, tend to evolve gradually with frequent changes in the activity and the interactions of their participants. Furthermore, the communities inside the network can grow, shrink, merge, or split, and the entities can move from one community to another. The aim of community detection methods is precisely to detect the evolution of these communities. However, evaluating these algorithms requires tests on real or artificial networks with verifiable ground truth. Dynamic networks generators have been recently proposed for this task, but most of them consider only the structure of the network, disregarding the characteristics of the nodes. In this paper, we propose a new generator for dynamic attributed networks with community structure that follow the properties of real-world networks. The evolution of the network is performed using two kinds of operations: Micro-operations are applied on the edges and vertices, while macro-operations on the communities. Moreover, the properties of real-world networks such as preferential attachment or homophily are preserved during the evolution of the network, as confirmed by our experiments.",
Emotional Community Detection in Social Network,IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS,Oct 2017,2017,"Community detection is a pivotal task in data mining, and users' emotional behaviors have an important impact on today's society. So it is very significant for society management or marketing strategies to detect emotional communities in social networks. Based on the emotional homophily of users in social networks, it could confirm that users would like to gather together to form communities according to emotional similarity. This paper exploits multivariate emotional behaviors of users to measure users' emotional similarity, then takes advantage of users' emotional similarity as edge weight to remodel an emotional network and detect communities. The detailed process of detecting emotional communities is as follows: 1) an emotional network is constructed and emotional homophily in experimental dataset is verified; 2) both CNM and BGLL algorithms are employed to detect emotional communities in emotional network, and emotional characters of each community are analyzed; 3) in order to verify the superiority of emotional network for detecting emotional communities, 1 unweighted network and 3 other weighted and undirected networks are constructed as comparison. Comparison experiments indicate that the emotional network is more suitable for detecting emotional communities, the users' emotional behaviors are more similar and denser in identical communities of emotional network than the contrastive networks' communities.",
"Streaming, Tracking and Reading Achievement: A Multilevel Analysis of Students in 40 Countries",JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY,Oct 2017,2017,"Grouping similar students together within schools (streaming) or classrooms (tracking) based on past literacy skills (reported by parents), family socioeconomic status (SES) or reading attitudes might affect their reading achievement. Our multilevel analysis of the reading tests of 208,057 fourth-grade students across 40 countries, and their parents', teachers', principals', and their survey responses yielded the following results. Streaming was linked to higher reading achievement (consistent with customized instruction), but tracking was linked to lower reading achievement (consistent with more help opportunities). Students had higher reading achievement when classmates had stronger past literacy skills (suggesting sharing ideas) or extremely poor ones (help opportunities). Also, when classmates have higher family SES, students had higher reading achievement (suggesting sharing resources), with diminishing marginal returns. When classmates' family SES differed more (more diversity), students with greater past literacy skills had higher reading achievement (Matthew effect). Lastly, when classmates had better reading attitudes, students with lower past literacy skills showed higher reading achievement (modeling, norms). When classmates' reading attitudes differed more, students had higher reading achievement (contrasting cases), although extreme differences weakened this link (less homophily). These results suggest that streaming across schools and mixing of students within classrooms (by past achievement, family SES and reading attitudes) are linked to overall reading achievement.",
The network dynamics of co-offending careers,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2017,2017,"Despite the long-standing acknowledgement that crime is a group phenomenon, little research treats co-offending as a dynamic network process. This study analyses the individual and network processes responsible for long-lasting criminal relationships using co-offendingdyads from eight years of arrest records in Chicago. Results from proportional hazard models suggest that homophily with respect to age, race, gender, geographic proximity, and gang identity lead to sustained partnerships. Victimization increases the probability of continued co-offending, while the victimization of one's associates dissuade continued collaboration. Supra-dyadic processes (centrality, transitivity) influence the likelihood of continued co-offending. Results are discussed regarding opportunities and turning points. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Friends in locked places: An investigation of prison inmate network structure,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2017,2017,"The current study investigates informal social structure among prison inmates. Data come from the Prison Inmate Network Study (PINS), a project focused on a unit of a Pennsylvania medium security men's prison. We focus on 205 inmates and their ""get along with"" network - an approximation of friendship in other settings. We find a weak subgroup structure dominated by two groups of ""old heads"" and characterized by moderate (non gang-based) race/ethnic clustering. Structurally, the network resembles adolescents in schools, suggesting that prison inmates are capable, of successfully building peer associations. We conclude that under the right conditions self-organizing inmate society can foster social integration reminiscent of other social settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Evidence of complex contagion of information in social media: An experiment using Twitter bots,PLOS ONE,Sep 22 2017,2017,"It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using 'social bots' deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques.",
Vaccination and public trust: A model for the dissemination of vaccination behaviour with external intervention,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Sep 15 2017,2017,"Vaccination is widely recognized as the most effective way of immunization against many infectious diseases. However, unfounded claims about supposed side effects of some vaccines have contributed to spread concern and fear among people, thus inducing vaccination refusal. MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccine coverage has undergone an important decrease in a large part of Europe and US as a consequence of erroneously alleged side effects, leading to recent measles outbreaks. There is evidence that clusterization of unvaccinated individuals may lead to epidemics way larger that the ones that might appear in the case that unvaccinated agents are distributed at random in the population. In this work we explore the emergence of those clusters as a consequence of the social interaction driven mainly by homophily, where vaccination behaviour is part of a process of cultural dissemination in the spirit of Axelrod's model. The ingredients of this calculation encompass: (i) interacting agents which are to decide if they vaccinate or not their children, (ii) their interaction with a small subset of stubborn agents who believe that the MMR vaccine is not safe and (iii) government sponsored propaganda trying to convince people of the benefits of vaccination. We find that these clusters, which emerge as a dynamical outcome of the model, are the responsible of the increasing probability of the occurrence of measles outbreaks, even in scenarios where the WHO (World Health Organization) recommendation of 95% vaccine coverage is fulfilled. However, we also illustrate that the mitigating effect of a public health campaign, could effectively reduce the impact and size of outbreaks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Reputation offsets trust judgments based on social biases among Airbnb users,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Sep 12 2017,2017,"To provide social exchange on a global level, sharing-economy companies leverage interpersonal trust between their members on a scale unimaginable even a few years ago. A challenge to this mission is the presence of social biases among a large heterogeneous and independent population of users, a factor that hinders the growth of these services. We investigate whether and to what extent a sharing-economy platform can design artificially engineered features, such as reputation systems, to override people's natural tendency to base judgments of trustworthiness on social biases. We focus on the common tendency to trust others who are similar (i.e., homophily) as a source of bias. We test this argument through an online experiment with 8,906 users of Airbnb, a leading hospitality company in the sharing economy. The experiment is based on an interpersonal investment game, in which we vary the characteristics of recipients to study trust through the interplay between homophily and reputation. Our findings show that reputation systems can significantly increase the trust between dissimilar users and that risk aversion has an inverse relationship with trust given high reputation. We also present evidence that our experimental findings are confirmed by analyses of 1 million actual hospitality interactions among users of Airbnb.",
Homophily in Human Resource Management Publishing,EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW,FAL 2017,2017,"Existing theory suggests that social networks form a major factor in individual and team performance, including in academic collaborative research. However, there is currently a lack of a theoretical framework to explain the social network related factors that influence publication processes and decisions. We address this gap by adopting a theory-building perspective, analysing a large data set on the impact of social networks. Using a case of one leading journal (Human Resource Management), we collected data on 10years of publication, exploring 327 papers, written by 667 authors, which represent 839 ties. Examining individual demographic and institutional characteristics, we developed and tested a set of hypotheses, providing a framework for shaping and guiding future academic research collaborations. Our findings suggest that as albeit the intention, diverse collaboration is still at a low level. This contribution adds to the literature on understanding the factors influencing the type of collaborations that lead to publications in leading journals.",
Public deliberation on government-managed social media: A study on Weibo users in China,GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY,Sep 2017,2017,"Governments' increasing presence on social media enables a wide range of new modes of interaction that go beyond government information and service provision to include the key social media capability of user-to-user interactions. These interactions can either contribute to deliberative practices - characterised by exposure to different opinions, mutual understanding, and reasonableness - or hinder them, resulting in increased homophily and polarisation. Using the theoretical lens of public deliberation, this study investigates attitudinal and cognitive aspects of user conversations on government-managed social media accounts. Drawing on a survey of 417 users of the Chinese social media platform Weibo, our findings show that interactions on social media are mostly non-dialogical and non-creative in nature, and characterised by homophily and polarisation, even though users perceive their interactions as deliberative. Moreover, interactions on government-managed social media are less deliberative than on other platforms. Our findings contribute to research on government social media from the user side, and to practice of government social media management aimed at citizen engagement.",
Mapping the growing discipline of dissemination and implementation science in health,SCIENTOMETRICS,Sep 2017,2017,"The field of dissemination and implementation (D&I) research in health has grown considerably in the past decade. Despite the potential for advancing the science, limited research has focused on mapping the field. We administered an online survey to individuals in the D&I field to assess participants' demographics and expertise, as well as engagement with journals and conferences, publications, and grants. A combined roster-nomination method was used to collect data on participants' advice networks and collaboration networks; participants' motivations for choosing collaborators was also assessed. Frequency and descriptive statistics were used to characterize the overall sample; network metrics were used to characterize both networks. Among a sub-sample of respondents who were researchers, regression analyses identified predictors of two metrics of academic performance (i.e., publications and funded grants). A total of 421 individuals completed the survey, representing a 30.75% response rate of eligible individuals. Most participants were White (n = 343), female (n = 284, 67.4%), and identified as a researcher (n = 340, 81%). Both the advice and the collaboration networks displayed characteristics of a small world network. The most important motivations for selecting collaborators were aligned with advancing the science (i.e., prior collaborators, strong reputation, and good collaborators) rather than relying on human proclivities for homophily, proximity, and friendship. Among a sub-sample of 295 researchers, expertise (individual predictor), status (advice network), and connectedness (collaboration network) were significant predictors of both metrics of academic performance. Network-based interventions can enhance collaboration and productivity; future research is needed to leverage these data to advance the field.",
Advances in the attraction model for inter-group relations,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,Sep 2017,2017,"The present paper discusses a model of attraction towards similar others as a theoretical account of the problem of homophily in social relations. The focus of the paper is on investigating the properties of the model. More specifically, upon presentation of the logic behind the model, the discussion goes on to investigate the effects of social structural conditions (i.e., margins of an association matrix) on the model parameters especially those referring to the strength of the homophily bias. This investigation leads to a reformulation of the problem of salience of a characteristic for association, defined, after Blau (1977) and Skvoretz (1983), in terms of the difference between the actual frequency of intra-group ties and the frequency expected under randomness. The attraction model is then compared with the log-linear model of quasi-independence. The objective of this comparisons is a precise specification of the attraction model's explanatory scope. The paper ends with an illustrative application of the model to GSS data on confiding relations along ethnicity and religious affiliation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Increasing ethnic diversity moderates longitudinal effects of individual differences on friendship homophily,JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,SEP-OCT 2017,2017,"This study examined direct and interactive effects of social-emotional adjustment, national and ethnic identification, and school ethnic composition on friendship homophily among 214 ethnic minority and 183 ethnic majority English children, aged between 5 and 11 years. The data came from a longitudinal study, which included 3 time points, spanning a 12-month period. Results of multilevel latent growth curve models showed that among ethnic minority English children (teacher-rated), peer problems and ethnic identity were associated with more friendship homophily, whereas a bicultural identity was not related to more friendship homophily. Among ethnic majority English children, the effects of peer problems and English identity were moderated by school ethnic composition, such that these factors were not associated with more friendship homophily in more ethnically diverse schools. The findings are discussed on the basis of theories of intergroup contact and intergroup threat.",
"How ""Doing Gender"" Leads to Gender Imbalances in the Higher Ranks in Colleges of Business [And How To ""Undo Gender""]",ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT LEARNING & EDUCATION,Sep 1 2017,2017,"Faculty gatekeepers who control promotions to senior academic positions in business schools are tenured associate and full professors, and their numbers are overwhelmingly male. This gender disparity in the higher ranks of academe can lead to masculinized organizational practices that frame tenure-and-promotion cases in business schools, leading to biased decision making that can undervalue female faculty members' scholarly contributions that do not conform to the taken-for-granted patterns established by successful males. We examine the evidence to determine the extent of the gender balance problem in senior positions in colleges of business in the US. In addition, we provide several conceptual frameworks; namely, homophily and hegemonic masculinities, and expectations state theory, social role theory, and shifting standards theory, which provide theoretical insights into how gender bias can unintentionally enter the promotion process in business schools. We provide a framework that business schools can implement to make decision making on promotion and advancement more equitable and engender a more welcoming environment for female faculty, ultimately caulking the ""leaky pipeline"" and allowing more female faculty to advance to the highest ranks of academe. Last, we offer new directions for research on attaining better gender balance in colleges of business.",
"Paternalism, homophily and cultural transmission in random networks",GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR,Sep 2017,2017,"We study cultural diffusion in a random network where the transition probabilities are determined by a cultural transmission technology with endogenous vertical transmission rates (a la Bisin and Verdier, 2001). We present a two-way epidemic model in which both the infection and the recovery rates are endogenous and depend on the topology of the network. We characterize two balancing conditions satisfied by the network degree distribution and the vertical transmission rate distribution to ensure the sustainability of long run cultural heterogeneity. We discuss the effedts of cultural homophily and paternalistic motivations for cultural transmission on the persistence of steady state cultural diversity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Privacy-constrained network formation,GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR,Sep 2017,2017,"We study the effects of privacy concerns on social network formation. Each individual decides which others to form links with. Links bring direct benefits from friendship but also lead to the sharing of information via a percolation process. Privacy concerns are modeled as a disutility that the individual suffers as a result of her private information being acquired by others. We specify conditions under which pure-strategy equilibria exist and characterize both pure-strategy and mixed-strategy equilibria. The resulting equilibrium networks feature clustered connections and homophily. Clustering emerges because if player a is friend with b and b is friend with c, then a's information is likely to be shared indirectly with c anyway, making it less costly for a to befriend c. Homophily emerges because small additional benefits of friendship within a group make linkages and thus information sharing within that group more likely, further increasing the likelihood within-group links.

The effect of online reviews on hotel booking intention: The role of reader-reviewer similarity,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT,Sep 2017,2017,"Due to the experiential nature of travel-related products, online reviews have become an increasingly popular information source in travel planning and have a profound effect on consumers' buying decisions, particularly in hotel booking. On the basis of homophily and similarity-attraction theory, we posit that review valence is positively related to consumers' hotel booking intentions, and expect this relationship to be moderated by surface- (demographic) and deep-level (preference) similarities. The findings from two experiments conducted in Germany and Macau indicate that review valence significantly affects hotel booking intention, and that reader-reviewer demographic similarity moderates this effect. This three-way interaction reveals a substituting moderation effect between demographic similarity and preference similarity. One practical implication is that travel websites should find methods of exposing users to reviews written by those with either similar demographic characteristics or preferences, which facilitate travelers' decision-making processes.

Homophily in higher education: Historicizing the AERA member-to-fellow pipeline using theories of social reproduction and social networks,POLICY FUTURES IN EDUCATION,Sep 2017,2017,"This study examines select demographics of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) Fellows (n=644), and whether or not the cohorts of AERA Fellows are becoming more diverse in racial and gender terms in relation to the inaugural year of Fellows in 2008. This study tests the mission statement of this exclusive program to ...recognize excellence in research and be inclusive of the scholarship that constitutes and enriches education research as an interdisciplinary field'. Our findings suggest that homophily - a sociological phenomenon that describes the ways in which individuals and institutions prefer sameness - is a real problem in higher education, and programs such as the AERA Fellowship are not accomplishing their mission to recognize the research of faculty of color, women faculty, and faculty in interdisciplinary fields. In contrast to the AERA Fellows mission statement, we find that the Fellowship program relies on homophilous social networks in selecting AERA Fellows and, in turn, reinforces social reproduction in higher education.",
Bad Company: Understanding negative peer effects in college achievement,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,Sep 2017,2017,"Existing peer effects studies produce contradictory findings, including positive, negative, large, and small effects, despite similar contexts. We explore these results using U.S. Naval Academy data covering a 17-year history of the random assignment of students to peer groups. Coupled with students' limited discretion over freshman-year courses, our setting affords an opportunity to better understand peer effects in different social contexts. We find negative effects at the broader ""company"" level - students' social and residential group - and positive effects at the narrower course-company level within small peer groups. We suggest that peer spillovers change direction because of differences in the underlying mechanism of peer influence. Published by Elsevier B.V.",
The Role of Mere Closeness: How Geographic Proximity Affects Social Influence,JOURNAL OF MARKETING,Sep 2017,2017,"Geographic proximity has become increasingly relevant due to the growing number of marketing services that use consumers' geographic locations, thus increasing the importance of gaining insights from this information. In five studies (both field and experimental), the authors analyze the effect of geographic proximity on social influence and demonstrate that not only social proximity but also perceived homophily can trigger social influence. They find that this effect holds under alternative representations of geographic distance and is confirmed for a range of different services and even for physical goods. Furthermore, the authors show that geographic proximity has a relative effect because the social influence of a closer sender is stronger than that of a more distant sender, regardless of the absolute distances. They present managerially relevant conditions under which the influence of geographic proximity not only is comparable to other types of information such as age or gender but also provides sufficient informational value for customers to offset differences among alternatives (e.g., due to higher prices) in trade-off decisions.",
"DO BIRDS OF A FEATHER REALLY FLOCK TOGETHER? FRIENDSHIPS, SELF-CONTROL SIMILARITY AND DEVIANT BEHAVIOUR",BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY,Sep 2017,2017,"In addition to research consistently linking self-control to crime, a person's level of self-control is hypothesized to be the root cause of why friendships form. Namely, people with low self-control should 'flock together' in highly deviant friendships, and, inversely, persons with high self-control should 'flock together' in non-deviant friendships. Using dyadic friendship data, this study examines the extent to which self-control similarity, termed self-control 'homophily', exists and what implications it carries for deviance. Using hierarchical linear modelling, results demonstrate that friends' levels of self-control are dissimilar and fail to interact in relation to crime. Instead, differences in friends' levels of self-control may be more strongly related to crime, failing to support Gottfredson and Hirschi's hypothesis.",
The Network Dynamics of Status: Assimilation and Selection,SOCIAL FORCES,Sep 2017,2017,"Using longitudinal data that we have collected on friendship and advice relations in a cohort of MBA students, we examine how status affects the dynamics of network ties among peers. Estimates of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs) suggest that status is a consequence of network ties because over time the level of status attributed to individual students by other students tends to the average level of status attributed to their network partners-a phenomenon we call status assimilation. Status is also an antecedent to network ties because it affects partner selection decisions, giving rise to distinct forms of social attachment. We find that both network-based processes of status assimilation, as well as status-based processes of social selection, are present, but they vary subtly yet significantly across network domains. Students tend to the average level of status of their friends, but not to that of their advisors. High-status students are more active in the friendship network, but more popular in the advice network. We find evidence of performance homophily rather than status homophily: students with similar grades are more likely to exchange friendship and advice ties. High-status students tend to be more central in the advice network, but status attributions spill over through friendship, rather than advice relations. The study documents how the relation between social status and social networks varies both over time, as well as across network domains. The study also demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiplexity-the tendency of a network to operate through another.",
The co-evolution of emotional well-being with weak and strong friendship ties,NETWORK SCIENCE,Sep 2017,2017,"Social ties are strongly related to well-being. But what characterizes this relationship? This study investigates social mechanisms explaining how social ties affect well-being through social integration and social influence, and how well-being affects social ties through social selection. We hypothesize that highly integrated individuals-those with more extensive and dense friendship networks-report higher emotional well-being than others. Moreover, emotional well-being should be influenced by the well-being of close friends. Finally, wellbeing should affect friendship selection when individuals prefer others with higher levels of well-being, and others whose well-being is similar to theirs. We test our hypotheses using longitudinal social network and well-being data of 117 individuals living in a graduate housing community. The application of a novel extension of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for ordered networks (ordered SAOMs) allows us to detail and test our hypotheses for weak-and strong-tied friendship networks simultaneously. Results do not support our social integration and social influence hypotheses but provide evidence for selection: individuals with higher emotional well-being tend to have more strong-tied friends, and there are homophily processes regarding emotional well-being in strong-tied networks. Our study highlights the two-directional relationship between social ties and well-being, and demonstrates the importance of considering different tie strengths for various social processes.",
A 'Different Class'? Homophily and Heterophily in the Social Class Networks of Britpop,CULTURAL SOCIOLOGY,Sep 2017,2017,"Social network analysis is increasingly recognised as a useful way to explore music scenes. In this article we examine the individuals who were the cultural workforce that comprised the Britpop' music scene of the 1990s. The focus of our analysis is homophily and heterophily to determine whether the clusters of friendships and working relationships of those who were best connected' in the scene were patterned by original social class position. We find that Britpop's whole network' is heterophilic but that its sub-networks' are more likely to be social class homophilic. The sub-networks that remain heterophilic are likely to be united by other common experiences that brought individuals in the network to the same social spaces. We suggest that our findings on Britpop might be generalised to the composition of other music scenes, cultural workforces and aggregations of young people. Our study differs from research on, first, British indie music' and social class which focuses upon the construction, representation and performance of social location rather than the relationships it might shape and second, the pioneering social network analyses of music scenes which currently lack explicit emphasis on social class.",
Status discrepancy as a driver of residential mobility: Evidence from Oslo,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A,Sep 2017,2017,"Planners have long advocated for ""social mix"" in neighborhoods without clear evidence that such mixing is stable over time. Indeed, if some groups perceive an intolerable discrepancy between their own economic status and that of their neighbors they may leave the neighborhood, thereby frustrating planners' goals. We conduct a longitudinal analysis of Oslo household intrametropolitan residential mobility employing a panel model with fixed effects for both households and neighborhoods and interactions for status groups, which provides estimates of plausible causal effects. We theoretically and empirically identify two dimensions of intraneighborhood status discrepancy that prove important predictors of leaving a neighborhood, though impacts differ strongly depending on household income status as defined by Oslo-wide standards. More extreme relative standing above the neighborhood median income promotes exit (especially for low- and middle-status households), suggesting a status signaling motive. For high-status households, being below the median neighborhood income proves influential for out-mobility, suggesting a relative deprivation motive. The overall status composition of the neighborhood is a powerful mobility influence for both low- and high-status households, suggesting a strong preference for homophily. Results imply that policy-generated introduction of low-status households will encourage the exit of high- and, to a lesser degree, middle-status neighbors.",
"Integrating Ego, Homophily, and Structural Factors to Measure User Influence in Online Community",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION,Sep 2017,2017,"Research problem: In the current information age, people are increasingly accustomed to sharing their special interests online and are influenced by the relationships developed from that sharing. The purpose of this study was to better measure peer influence in these online communities. Research questions: 1. How can peer influence in online communities be measured in a way that comprehensively incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network? 2. Is the method proposed in this study superior to other existing methods? Literature review: Previous literature on measuring online user influence can be classified into two streams: 1. Those that focus on the intrinsic characteristics of social media players to measure peer influence; 2. Those that address social network structure. Relevant computing algorithms include Topic-Based PageRank, Quality-Structure index, and so on. Although the first stream considers a focal peer's intrinsic characteristics, it overlooks the interpeer attraction in terms of similarity and discrepant knowledge among peers. The second stream mostly stresses the structures of social networks to measure network-wide peer influence but underestimates the effect of interpeer attraction that may leverage every diffusion step of peer influence through the network. To fill this research gap, this study proposes a new method of measuring network user influence that incorporates peers' intrinsic factors, interpeer influence factors as homophily effect, and network structure. Homophily refers to the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar with respect to certain attributes. Methodology: From the communication sender-receiver perspective, we developed a computable method that incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network to measure the social network user influence. Two empirical studies were subsequently conducted in a social network service-based online community and an online professional logistics community to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and conclusions: The empirical results show that our proposed method provides higher prediction accuracy of user influence rank in an online community than the other existing methods. These findings lay a foundation for future theoretical exploration and provide a useful tool for targeting influential users in online communities such as blogs, bulletin board systems, and forums.",
Formation of homophily in academic performance: Students change their friends rather than performance,PLOS ONE,Aug 30 2017,2017,"Homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with others who share similar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in the formation and evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is the result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their performance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and networks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical educational settings could have important implications for the understanding of the observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in societies.",
Explaining opinion polarisation with opinion copulas,PLOS ONE,Aug 22 2017,2017,"An empirically founded and widely established driving force in opinion dynamics is homophily i.e. the tendency of ""birds of a feather"" to ""flock together"". The closer our opinions are the more likely it is that we will interact and converge. Models using these assumptions are called bounded confidence models (BCM) as they assume a tolerance threshold after which interaction is unlikely. They are known to produce one or more clusters, depending on the size of the bound, with more than one cluster being possible only in the deterministic case. Introducing noise, as is likely to happen in a stochastic world, causes BCM to produce consensus which leaves us with the open problem of explaining the emergence and sustainance of opinion clusters and polarisation. We investigate the role of heterogeneous priors in opinion formation, introduce the concept of opinion copulas, argue that it is well supported by findings in Social Psychology and use it to show that the stochastic BCM does indeed produce opinion clustering without the need for extra assumptions.",
Homophilic replicator equations,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY,Aug 2017,2017,"Tags are conspicuous attributes of organisms that affect the behaviour of other organisms toward the holder, and have previously been used to explore group formation and altruism. Homophilic imitation, a form of tag-based selection, occurs when organisms imitate those with similar tags. Here we further explore the use of tag-based selection by developing homophilic replicator equations to model homophilic imitation dynamics. We assume that replicators have both tags (sometimes called traits) and strategies. Fitnesses are determined by the strategy profile of the population, and imitation is based upon the strategy profile, fitness differences, and similarity in tag space. We show the characteristics of resulting fixed manifolds and conditions for stability. We discuss the phenomenon of coat-tailing (where tags associated with successful strategies increase in abundance, even though the tags are not inherently beneficial) and its implications for population diversity. We extend our model to incorporate recurrent mutations and invasions to explore their implications upon tag and strategy diversity. We find that homophilic imitation based upon tags significantly affects the diversity of the population, although not the ESS. We classify two different types of invasion scenarios by the strategy and tag compositions of the invaders and invaded. In one scenario, we find that novel tags introduced by invaders become more readily established with homophilic imitation than without it. In the other, diversity decreases. Lastly, we find a negative correlation between homophily and the rate of convergence.",
The rise and fall of R&D networks,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,Aug 2017,2017,"Drawing on a large database of publicly announced R&D alliances, we empirically investigate the evolution of R&D networks and the process of alliance formation in several manufacturing sectors over a 24-year period (1986-2009). Our goal is to empirically evaluate the temporal and sectoral robustness of a large set of network indicators, thus providing a more complete description of R&D networks with respect to the existing literature. We find that most network properties are not only invariant across sectors, but also independent of the scale of aggregation at which they are observed, and we highlight the presence of core-periphery architectures in explaining some properties emphasized in previous empirical studies (e.g. asymmetric degree distributions and small worlds). In addition, we show that many properties of R&D networks are characterized by a rise-and-fall dynamics with a peak in the mid-nineties. We find that such dynamics is driven by mechanisms of accumulative advantage, structural homophily, and multiconnectivity. In particular, the change from the ""rise"" to the ""fall"" phase is associated to a structural break in the importance of multiconnectivity.",
Is there a gender-based fragmentation of communication science? An investigation of the reasons for the apparent gender homophily in citations,SCIENTOMETRICS,Aug 2017,2017,"Multiple studies report that male scholars cite publications of male authors more often than their female colleagues do-and vice versa. This gender homophily in citations points to a fragmentation of science along gender boundaries. However, it is not yet clear whether it is actually (perceived) gender characteristics or structural conditions related to gender that are causing the heightened citation frequency of same-sex authors. A bibliometric study on the two leading German communication science journals Publizistik and Medien & Kommunikationswissenschaft was employed to further analyze the causes of the phenomenon. As scholars tend to primarily cite sources from their own area of research, differences among male and female scholars regarding their engagement in certain research fields become relevant. It was thus hypothesized that the research subject might mediate the relationship between the citing and cited authors' genders. A first analysis based on n = 917 papers published in the period from 1970 to 2009 confirmed the expected gender-differences regarding research-activity in certain fields. Subsequently, structural equation modeling was employed to test the suggested mediation model. Results show the expected mediation to be a complementary one indicating that gender homophily in citations is partly due to topical boundaries. While there are alternative explanations for the remaining direct effect, it may suggest that a fragmentation of science along gender boundaries is indeed an issue that communication science must face.",
Social media and relationship development: The effect of valence and intimacy of posts,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Aug 2017,2017,"Social media is becoming an increasingly common part of everyday life. Many social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Linkedln) support new interpersonal interaction methods, some of which are neither directed nor reciprocated. For example, social media users can read online 'posts' (self-disclosures) of their friends without interacting with those friends. This is vastly different to traditional face-to-face communication. Our study investigated how reading online 'posts' affects relationship development. Using a longitudinal design sampling 243 participants, we focused on the effect of the posts' valence and intimacy. We found that high intimacy posts or negative posts decreased the social attractiveness of the self-discloser. The perception of the posts and the receiver's feelings of homophily to the self-discloser mediated this relationship. Studies of offline interpersonal interaction have found similar results. In offline communication, self-disclosure perception and homophily also mediate relationship outcomes. This suggests that reading posts on social media and interacting in real life trigger similar or identical relationship formation pathways. These results support the argument that passive consumption is a new method of interaction that does not fundamentally change human psychology. While novel, passive consumption is still based on the same principles as offline communication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
On the centennial anniversary of Gini's theory of statistical relations,METRON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STATISTICS,Aug 2017,2017,"The formulation of a unitary methodology for the analysis of relationships between statistical characters stands as a landmark in the Gini contribution to theoretical statistics. On the occasion of the centennial anniversary of the appearance of his most original and important contributions to the subject, this paper aims at highlighting Gini's proposals, by reformulating them in a language which suits the modern treatments of mathematical statistics. An effort is made to stress the precursory value of those proposals, and to mention in a precise way some of their most significant developments, in particular as far as metrics for spaces of probability distributions and studies about monotone dependence are concerned.",
Acculturational homophily,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,Aug 2017,2017,"Economists have long recognized the influence of friends on various outcomes among immigrants, and also observed the benefit of acculturation. This paper lies at the intersection of the above two topics: by focusing on a typical behavior of acculturation, namely English-name usage, I examine the extent of acculturational homophily among Chinese students. Specifically, I investigate the relationship between self English-name usage and English-name usage of close friends using online social networking data on students who receive undergraduate education in China and graduate education in the U.S. The empirical analysis relies on an instrumental variable strategy: I use the indicator of the difficulty of pronouncing the Chinese name in English to instrument for English-name usage. Results suggest the presence of acculturational homophily: students with English-name usage have more close friends who are also English-name users, and the relationship is not based on the number of close friends overall.

Understanding Social Causalities Behind Human Action Sequences,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS,Aug 2017,2017,"Social causality study on human action sequences is useful and important to improve our understandings to human behaviors on online social networks. The redundant indirect causalities and unobserved confounding factors, such as homophily and simultaneity phenomena, contribute to the huge challenges on accurate causal discovery on such human actions. A causal relationship exists between two persons, if the actions of one person are significantly affected by the actions of the other person, while fairly independent of her/his own prior actions. In this paper, we design a systematic approach based on conditional independence testing to detect such asymmetric relations, even when there are latent confounders underneath the observational action sequences. Technically, a group of asymmetric independence tests are conducted to infer the loose causal directions between action sequence pairs, followed by another group of tests to distinguish different types of relationships, e.g., homophily and simultaneity. Finally, a causal structure learning method is employed to output pairwise causalities with redundant indirect causalities eliminated. Empirical evaluations on simulated data verify the effectiveness and scalability of our proposals. We also present four interesting patterns of causal relations found by our algorithm, on real Sina Weibo feeds, including two new patterns never reported in previous studies.",
Connected to Create: A Social Network Analysis of Friendship Ties and Creativity,PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS,Aug 2017,2017,"The purpose of this article was to examine the relationship between friendship ties and creativity. Based on the homophily hypothesis, we predicted friendship ties would more likely occur between people similar to each other on creativity-related attributes. We also predicted students would be more likely to report friendship ties with peers who have higher creativity scores in general. Across a pilot and primary study, we examined the relationship between friendship strength among high school students in a pilot study (Study 1) and friendship nominations among elementary school students in a primary study (Study 2) with creativity. In Study 2, but not Study 1, we found that friendship nominations were more likely to occur when scores on a creativity task were similar. In both studies, we found that popularity was positively related to originality (Study 1) and creativity (Study 2). The results indicate that elementary school students nominated peers as friends who are similar to them when it comes to creativity and that there is a positive relationship between popularity and creativity.",
Political rumoring on Twitter during the 2012 US presidential election: Rumor diffusion and correction,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Aug 2017,2017,"Social media can be a double-edged sword for political misinformation, either a conduit propagating false rumors through a large population or an effective tool to challenge misinformation. To understand this phenomenon, we tracked a comprehensive collection of political rumors on Twitter during the 2012 US presidential election campaign, analyzing a large set of rumor tweets (n=330,538). We found that Twitter helped rumor spreaders circulate false information within homophilous follower networks, but seldom functioned as a self-correcting marketplace of ideas. Rumor spreaders formed strong partisan structures in which core groups of users selectively transmitted negative rumors about opposing candidates. Yet, rumor rejecters neither formed a sizable community nor exhibited a partisan structure. While in general rumors resisted debunking by professional fact-checking sites (e.g. Snopes), this was less true of rumors originating with satirical sources.",
Does Educational Similarity Drive Parental Support?,JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY,Aug 2017,2017,"This article tests competing mechanisms explaining linkages between parent-child educational similarity and parental advice and interest to adult children, asking whether mechanisms differ for mothers and fathers. Educational similarities might provide common ground whereas educational dissimilarity affects parents' authority to dispense advice. Using ordered logistic regression with data from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (N = 2,444) parental advice and interest are modeled separately for mothers and fathers. Seemingly unrelated estimation is used to test for gender differences across models, revealing that mechanisms driving parental support differ by parents' gender. Fathers show more interest in adult children when they are educationally similar (consistent with the homophily hypothesis), but only among the highly educated, whereas mothers show more interest to highly educated children, regardless of their own level of educational attainment. Fathers' advice is conditioned on their own educational attainment whereas mothers give advice unconditionally (consistent with the gender hypothesis).",
An analysis of respondent-driven sampling with injecting drug users in a high HIV prevalent state of India,HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL,Jul 3 2017,2017,"Background: Personal networks are significant social spaces to spread of HIV or other blood-borne infections among hard-to-reach population, viz., injecting drug users, female sex workers, etc. Sharing of infected needles or syringes among drug users is one of the major routes of HIV transmission in Manipur, a high HIV prevalence state in India. This study was carried out to describe the network characteristics and recruitment patterns of injecting drug users and to assess the association of personal network with injecting risky behaviors in Manipur.Methods: A total of 821 injecting drug users were recruited into the study using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) from Bishnupur and Churachandpur districts of Manipur; data on demographic characteristics, HIV risk behaviors, and network size were collected from them. Transition probability matrices and homophily indices were used to describe the network characteristics, and recruitment patterns of injecting drug users. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models were performed to analyze the association between the personal networks and sharing of needles or syringes.Results: The average network size was similar in both the districts. Recruitment analysis indicates injecting drug users were mostly engaged in mixed age group setting for injecting practice. Ever married and new injectors showed lack of in-group ties. Younger injecting drug users had mainly recruited older injecting drug users from their personal network. In logistic regression analysis, higher personal network was found to be significantly associated with increased likelihood of injecting risky behaviors.Conclusion: Because of mixed personal network of new injectors and higher network density associated with HIV exposure, older injecting drug users may act as a link for HIV transmission or other blood-borne infections to new injectors and also to their sexual partners. The information from this study may be useful to understanding the network pattern of injecting drug users for enriching the HIV prevention in this region.",
Factors Affecting Individual Level ERP Assimilation in a Social Network Perspective: A Multi-Case Stuty,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,JUL-SEP 2017,2017,"Prior research on ERP assimilation has primarily focused on influential factors at the organizational level. In this study, the authors attempt to extend their understanding of individual level ERP assimilation from the perspective of social network theory. They designed a multi-case study to explore the relations between ERP users' social networks and their levels of ERP assimilation based on the three dimensions of the social networks. The authors gathered data through interviews with 26 ERP users at different levels in five companies. Qualitative analysis was used to understand the effects of social networks and interactive learning. They found that users' social networks play a significant role in individual level ERP assimilation through interactive learning among users. They also found five key factors that facilitate users' assimilation of ERP knowledge: homophily (age, position and rank), tie content (instrumental and expressive ties), tie strength, external ties, and centrality.",
AN ECONOMETRIC MODEL OF NETWORK FORMATION WITH DEGREE HETEROGENEITY,ECONOMETRICA,Jul 2017,2017,"I introduce a model of undirected dyadic link formation which allows for assortative matching on observed agent characteristics (homophily) as well as unrestricted agent-level heterogeneity in link surplus (degree heterogeneity). Like in fixed effects panel data analyses, the joint distribution of observed and unobserved agent-level characteristics is left unrestricted. Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter, beta(0), are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic sequence involving a single network growing large. The first, tetrad logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree heterogeneity. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity {A(i0)}(i=1)(N) as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated. The TL estimate is consistent under both sparse and dense graph sequences, whereas consistency of the JML estimate is shown only under dense graph sequences.",
Using register data to deduce patterns of social exchange,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Jul 2017,2017,"This paper presents a novel method for deducting propensities for social exchange between individuals based on the choices they make, and based on factors such as country of origin, sex, school grades and socioeconomic background. The objective here is to disentangle the effect of social ties from the other factors, in order to find patterns of social exchange. This is done through a control-treatment design on analysing available data, where the treatment' is similarity of choices between socially connected individuals, and the control is similarity of choices between non-connected individuals. Structural dependencies are controlled for and effects from different classes are pooled through a mix of methods from network and meta-analysis. The method is demonstrated and tested on Swedish register data on students at upper secondary school. The results show that having similar grades is a predictor of social exchange. Also, previous results from Norwegian data are replicated, showing that students cluster based on country of origin.",
Scientific collaboration patterns vary with scholars' academic ages,SCIENTOMETRICS,Jul 2017,2017,"Scientists may encounter many collaborators of different academic ages throughout their careers. Thus, they are required to make essential decisions to commence or end a creative partnership. This process can be influenced by strategic motivations because young scholars are pursuers while senior scholars are normally attractors during new collaborative opportunities. While previous works have mainly focused on cross-sectional collaboration patterns, this work investigates scientific collaboration networks from scholars' local perspectives based on their academic ages. We aim to harness the power of big scholarly data to investigate scholars' academic-age-aware collaboration patterns. From more than 621,493 scholars and 2,646,941 collaboration records in Physics and Computer Science, we discover several interesting academic-age-aware behaviors. First, in a given time period, the academic age distribution follows the long-tail distribution, where more than 80% scholars are of young age. Second, with the increasing of academic age, the degree centrality of scholars goes up accordingly, which means that senior scholars tend to have more collaborators. Third, based on the collaboration frequency and distribution between scholars of different academic ages, we observe an obvious homophily phenomenon in scientific collaborations. Fourth, the scientific collaboration triads are mostly consisted with beginning scholars. Furthermore, the differences in collaboration patterns between these two fields in terms of academic age are discussed.",
Integrating sentiment and social structure to determine preference alignments: the Irish Marriage Referendum,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,Jul 2017,2017,"We examine the relationship between social structure and sentiment through the analysis of a large collection of tweets about the Irish Marriage Referendum of 2015. We obtain the sentiment of every tweet with the hashtags # marref and # marriageref that was posted in the days leading to the referendum, and construct networks to aggregate sentiment and use it to study the interactions among users. Our analysis shows that the sentiment of outgoing mention tweets is correlated with the sentiment of incoming mentions, and there are significantly more connections between users with similar sentiment scores than among users with opposite scores in the mention and follower networks. We combine the community structure of the follower and mention networks with the activity level of the users and sentiment scores to find groups that support voting 'yes' or 'no' in the referendum. There were numerous conversations between users on opposing sides of the debate in the absence of follower connections, which suggests that there were efforts by some users to establish dialogue and debate across ideological divisions. Our analysis shows that social structure can be integrated successfully with sentiment to analyse and understand the disposition of social media users around controversial or polarizing issues. These results have potential applications in the integration of data and metadata to study opinion dynamics, public opinion modelling and polling.",
Toward a Geographic Understanding of the Sharing Economy: Systemic Biases in UberX and TaskRabbit,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION,Jul 2017,2017,"Despite the geographically situated nature of most sharing economy tasks, little attention has been paid to the role that geography plays in the sharing economy. In this article, we help to address this gap in the literature by examining how four key principles from human geography-distance decay, structured variation in population density, mental maps, and ""the Big Sort"" (spatial homophily)-manifest in sharing economy platforms. We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms.",
Approval network: a novel approach for sentiment analysis in social networks,WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Jul 2017,2017,"The data-centric impetus and the development of online social networks has led to a significant amount of research that is nowadays more flexible in demonstrating several sociological hypotheses, such as the sentiment influence and transfer among users. Most of the works regarding sentiment classification usually consider text as unique source of information, do not taking into account that social networks are actually networked environments. To overcome this limitation, two main sociological theories should be accounted for addressing any sentiment analysis tasks: homophily and constructuralism. In this paper, we propose Approval Network as a novel graph representation to jointly model homophily and constructuralism, which is intended to better represent the contagion on social networks. To show the potentiality of the proposed representation, two novel sentiment analysis models have been proposed. The first one, related to user-level polarity classification, is approached by presenting a semi-supervised framework grounded on a Markov-based probabilistic model. The second task, aimed at simultaneously extracting aspects and sentiment at message level, is addressed by proposing a novel fully unsupervised generative model. The experimental results show that the proposes sentiment analysis models grounded on Approval Networks are able to outperform not only the traditional models where the relationships are disregarded, but also those computational approaches based on traditional friendship connections.",
"Uses and gratifications of social networking sites for bridging and bonding social capital: A comparison of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jul 2017,2017,"Applying uses and gratifications theory (UGT) and social capital theory, our study examined users of four social networking sites (SNSs) (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat), and their influence on online bridging and bonding social capital. Results (N = 297) found that Twitter users had the highest bridging social capital, followed by Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, while Snapchat users had the highest bonding social capital, followed by Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. SNS intensity, trust, tie strength, homophily, privacy concerns, introversion, and attention to social comparison were also found to moderate the relationship between SNS use and online bridging and bonding social capital.

"Media audience homophily: Partisan websites, audience identity and polarization processes",NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Jul 2017,2017,"The study suggests that media consumers favor certain websites not only due to their content but also due to their audience. A new concept is introduced: audience homophily, which describes one's preference for partisan media websites catering to a homogeneous, likeminded consumership. This attraction is explained in terms of the need for self-consistency, and I suggest that over time such behavior will polarize political identity through a spiral of reinforcement. Based on both a survey-experiment (N=300) and a panel study combined with web-tracking technology that recorded online-exposure behavior (N=397), it was found that individuals with more extreme ideology present higher levels of audience homophily and that, longitudinally, audience homophily is somewhat associated with ideological polarization, intolerance, and accessibility of political self-definition.",
Segregation in Friendship Networks,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,Jul 2017,2017,"We analyze a network-formation model where agents belong to different communities. Both individual benefits and costs depend on direct as well as indirect connections. Benefits of an indirect connection decrease with distance in the network, while the cost of a link depends on the type of agents involved. Two agents from the same community always face a low linking cost, while the cost of forming a relationship between two agents from different communities diminishes with the rate of exposure of each of them to the other community. We find that socialization among the same type of agent can be weak even if the cost of maintaining links within one's own type is very low. Our model also suggests that policies aimed at reducing segregation are socially desirable only if they reduce the within-community cost differential by a sufficiently large amount.",
Beyond interviewer effects in the standardized measurement of ego-centric networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2017,2017,"The effects which interviewers exert on the collection of ego-centric networks have recently come into the focus of methodological considerations. Studies consistently show that the size of networks varies depending on the interviewer. We would like to expand on this research strand by pointing to different aspects which have so far gone unremarked in the discussion. First, size is mainly analysed as a network measure which is influenced during data collection, while other common measures such as network density or composition have not received sufficient consideration. Second, large-scale surveys using face-to-face interviews usually allocate interviewers to a single sampling point. Differences between sampling points (locality effects) are attributed to interviewer effects. Hence, we disentangle the effects of the locality and interviewer. Third, the discussion on interviewer effects often follows an ""actor-oriented"" consideration of how data collection situations are structured by interviewers. Expanding this approach from a relational perspective, we consider the relationship between the interviewers and respondents and whether this relationship influences the collection of network data. To test our hypotheses about the influence of interviewers, the locality and the interviewer-respondent relationship on different network measures, we use data from the 2010 German General Social Survey (n = 2827 respondents, n = 220 interviewers). The multilevel analyses show that the relationship between the interviewer and the respondent is not very relevant. Furthermore, the analyses show that interviewers have an influence on the network size but not on measures of their composition. However, evidence on the prevalence of locality or interviewer effects is mixed. Finally, homophilous interviewer-respondent relationships have very little effect on network characteristics. We find evidence of training and fatigue effects on network size. However, much of the variation in network size caused by the interviewer still remains unexplained. We draw conclusions on how to organize interview situations in surveys. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
"A Model of Potential Encounters in the Workplace: The Relationships of Homophily, Spatial Distance, Organizational Structure, and Perceived Networks",ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR,Jul 2017,2017,"Potential face-to-face encounters are foundational to most workplace social interactions. There is little resolution on the question of what factors are antecedent to these encounters. This study examines the association of potential encounters with homophily, spatial distance, organizational structure, and perceived networks. Real-time, fine-grained data were collected using ultrawide-band location-tracking technology deployed at a knowledge-intensive subunit of a global manufacturing firm. The organization comprised scientists and engineers responsible for environmental policy, and emissions reporting and trading at the parent company. Potential encounters were constructed from the location data and modeled on the factors above using dyadic network regression models. The results show that spatial distance, organizational structure, and perceived network ties are all significantly related to potential encounters. Surprisingly, the homophily variables were nonsignificant. The contributions of this research regarding the relationship between potential face-to-face encounters and homophily, spatial distance, organizational structure, and perceived networks are discussed.",
Responsiveness of Mining Community Acceptance Model to Key Parameter Changes,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Jun 30 2017,2017,"The mining industry has difficulties predicting changes in the level of community acceptance of its projects over time. These changes are due to changes in the society and individual perceptions around these mines as a result of the mines' environmental and social impacts. Agent-based modeling can be used to facilitate better understanding of how community acceptance changes with changing mine environmental impacts. This work investigates the sensitivity of an agent-based model (ABM) for predicting changes in community acceptance of a mining project due to information diffusion to key input parameters. Specifically, this study investigates the responsiveness of the ABM to average degree (total number of friends) of the social network, close neighbour ratio (a measure of homophily in the social network) and number of early adopters (""innovators""). A two-level full factorial experiment was used to investigate the sensitivity of the model to these parameters. The primary (main), secondary and tertiary effects of each parameter were estimated to assess the model's sensitivity. The results show that the model is more responsive to close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters than average degree. Consequently, uncertainty surrounding the inferences drawn from simulation experiments using the agent-based model will be minimized by obtaining more reliable estimates of close neighbour ratio and number of early adopters. While it is possible to reliably estimate the level of early adopters from the literature, the degree of homophily (close neighbour ratio) has to be estimated from surveys that can be expensive and unreliable. Further, work is required to find economic ways to document relevant degrees of homophily in social networks in mining communities.",
The Role of Homophily in the Emergence of Opinion Controversies,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Jun 30 2017,2017,"Understanding the emergence of strong controversial issues in modern societies is a key issue in opinion studies. A commonly diffused idea is the fact that the increasing of homophily in social networks, due to the modern ICT, can be a driving force for opinion polarization. In this paper we address the problem with a modelling approach following three basic steps. We first introduce a network morphogenesis model to reconstruct network structures where homophily can be tuned with a parameter. We show that as homophily increases the emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks raises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent networks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps consensus formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure and we show that, actually, the combination of homophily and media makes the media effect less effective and leads to strongly polarized opinion clusters.",
"Social networks dynamics revealed by temporal analysis: An example in a non-human primate (Macaca sylvanus) in ""La Foret des Singes""",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,Jun 2017,2017,"This study applied a temporal social network analysis model to describe three affiliative social networks (allogrooming, sleep in contact, and triadic interaction) in a non-human primate species, Macaca sylvanus. Three main social mechanisms were examined to determine interactional patterns among group members, namely preferential attachment (i.e., highly connected individuals are more likely to form new connections), triadic closure (new connections occur via previous close connections), and homophily (individuals interact preferably with others with similar attributes). Preferential attachment was only observed for triadic interaction network. Triadic closure was significant in allogrooming and triadic interaction networks. Finally, gender homophily was seasonal for allogrooming and sleep in contact networks, and observed in each period for triadic interaction network. These individual-based behaviors are based on individual reactions, and their analysis can shed light on the formation of the affiliative networks determining ultimate coalition networks, and how these networks may evolve over time. A focus on individual behaviors is necessary for a global interactional approach to understanding social behavior rules and strategies. When combined, these social processes could make animal social networks more resilient, thus enabling them to face drastic environmental changes. This is the first study to pinpoint some of the processes underlying the formation of a social structure in a non-human primate species, and identify common mechanisms with humans. The approach used in this study provides an ideal tool for further research seeking to answer long-standing questions about social network dynamics.",
Inferring and analysis of social networks using RFID check-in data in China,PLOS ONE,Jun 1 2017,2017,"Social networks play an important role in our daily lives. However, social ties are rather elusive to quantify, especially for large groups of subjects over prolonged periods of time. In this work, we first propose a methodology for extracting social ties from long spatio-temporal data streams, where the subjects are 17,795 undergraduates from a university of China and the data streams are the 9,147,106 time-stamped RFID check-in records left behind by them during one academic year. By several metrics mentioned below, we then analyze the structure of the social network. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the network, and we confirm the small-world phenomenon on a global scale. Second, we find that the network shows clear community structure. And we observe that younger students at lower levels tend to form large communities, while students at higher levels mostly form smaller communities. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity on a global scale. Furthermore, we find a strong effect of grade and school on tie formation preference, but we do not find any strong region homophily. Our research may help us to elucidate the structural characteristics and the preference of the formation of social ties in college students' social network.",
Tracking Infection Diffusion in Social Networks: Filtering Algorithms and Threshold Bounds,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING OVER NETWORKS,Jun 2017,2017,"This paper deals with the statistical signal processing over graphs for tracking infection diffusion in social networks. Infection (or Information) diffusion is modeled using the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. Mean field approximation is employed to approximate the discrete valued infection dynamics by a deterministic difference equation, thereby yielding a generative model for the infection diffusion. The infection is shown to follow polynomial dynamics and is estimated using an exact nonlinear Bayesian filter. We compute posterior Cramer-Rao bounds to obtain the fundamental limits of the filter that depend on the structure of the network. The SIS model is extended to include homophily, and filtering on these networks is illustrated. Considering the randomly evolving nature of realworld networks, a filtering algorithm for estimating the underlying degree distribution is also investigated using generative models for the time evolution of the network. We validate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms with synthetic data and Twitter datasets. We find that the SIS model is a satisfactory fit for the information diffusion, and the nonlinear filter effectively tracks the information diffusion.",
"Household labour supply and the marriage market in the UK, 1991-2008",LABOUR ECONOMICS,Jun 2017,2017,"We document changes in labour supply, wage and education by gender and marital status using the British Household Panel Survey, 1991-2008, and seek to disentangle the main channels behind these changes. To this end, we use a version of Gousse et al. (2016)'s search-matching model of the marriage market with labour supply, which does not use information on home production time inputs. We derive conditions under which the model is identified. We estimate different parameters for each year. This allows us to quantify how much of the changes in labour supply, wage and education by gender and marital status depends on changes in the preferences for leisure of men and women and how much depends on changes in homophily.",
Spatial Homophily of Commercial Areas: The Case of Seoul,SUSTAINABILITY,Jun 2017,2017,"This paper attempts to answer the question of whether or not ""segregation"", or at least ""differentiation"", takes place in commercial areas in terms of ""spatial homophily"". Based on the 2010 Household Travel Survey data in the Seoul metropolitan area, we first identify Seoul's top 20 destinations for weekend shopping and leisure trips. Then, using traveler information regarding gender, age, and income, we calculate the percentage of female visitors, as well as the average and the coefficient of variation of age and income, for each destination. These statistics are employed to identify which groups and which shopping and leisure activity centers are characterized distinctively by spatial homophily. As a result, it is proved that ""differentiation"" takes place in commercial areas in terms of ""spatial homophily"". Moreover, paying attention to the ""Old Age, Low Income"" cluster in the old downtown area, we can raise the possibility of ""segregation"" in commercial areas.",
Homophily in an Anonymous Online Community: Sociodemographic Versus Personality Traits,CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING,Jun 2017,2017,"In what traits do people interact with others who are similar to them in completely anonymous online communication? Can those traits contribute to greater exchange of opinion and information across the socio-demographic boundaries that often limit interaction between social strata? To answer this question concerning online homophily, we combined survey data on 7,287 users (aged 18 and above) of a Korean online dating advice platform with their behavioral data from June 2015 to August 2015 and explored whether advice exchange occurred between users with similar sociodemographic and personality traits. On this platform, two types of interactions occurred as follows: (1) responses to a randomly distributed problem submitted by an advice seeker and (2) the seeker's indication of approval of any of the responses given. The study found that (1) a receiver was more likely to respond to problems submitted by seekers of a comparable age and that (2) seekers were more likely to approve of a response if the seeker and receiver had similar educational backgrounds. By contrast, homophily based on personality traits was not observed even though some personality traits significantly affected the likelihood of both response and approval. Our findings suggest that online communication may breed sociodemographic homophily, whether based on age or education, more than expected or intended while not easily fostering alternative forms of homophily, such as personality homophily, which can potentially cut across borders dividing sociodemographic groups.",
Using Network Sampling and Recruitment Data to Understand Social Structures Related to Community Health in a Population of People Who Inject Drugs in Rural Puerto Rico,PUERTO RICO HEALTH SCIENCES JOURNAL,Jun 2017,2017,"Objective: This research examined the social network and recruitment patterns of a sample of people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in rural Puerto Rico, in an attempt to uncover systematic clustering and between-group social boundaries that potentially influence disease spread.Methods: Respondent driven sampling was utilized to obtain a sample of PWID in rural Puerto Rico. Through eight initial ""seeds"", 317 injection drug users were recruited. Using recruitment patterns of this sample, estimates of homophily and affiliation were calculated using RDSAT.Results: Analyses showed clustering within the social network of PWID in rural Puerto Rico. In particular, females showed a very high tendency to recruit male PWID, which suggests low social cohesion among female PWID. Results for (believed) HCV status at the time of interview indicate that HCV+ individuals were less likely to interact with HCV- individuals or those who were unaware of their status, and may be acting as ""gatekeepers"" to prevent disease spread. Individuals who participated in a substance use program were more likely to affiliate with one another. The use of speedballs was related to clustering within the network, in which individuals who injected this mixture were more likely to affiliate with other speedball users.Conclusion: Social clustering based on several characteristics and behaviors were found within the IDU population in rural Puerto Rico. RDS was effective in not only garnering a sample of PWID in rural Puerto Rico, but also in uncovering social clustering that can potentially influence disease spread among this population.",
The Social-psychological Aspects of Team Formation: New Avenues for Research,SOCIOLOGY COMPASS,Jun 2017,2017,"The ubiquity of teams in the modern workplace cannot be denied, as Curseu, Kenis, and Raab (2009, p. 30) note, ""team formation is a challenge in modern organizations as most of them use teams to perform a variety of organizational tasks."" How teams form is, therefore, a question of much practical interest. Research illustrates that stratified social systems influence the choice and decision-making behaviors that shape group and team formation (Hechter, 1978). From a structural social psychological perspective (Sell & Kuipers, 2009; Lawler, Ridgeway, and Markovsky, 1993), teams are like microcosmic societies. They represent a process of social cohesion through interaction. Additionally, they can be organic, mechanical, homogeneous, and heterogeneous. In other words, teams are structural and cultural artifacts of societies. Members of society through interaction create these "" social artifacts,"" which may consist of hierarchically organizing sets of individuals into a group, or multiple groups, relative to power and status dimensions. In this paper, we aim to show how contributions from social psychology have informed research on team formation. Thus, two research questions guide this paper: What are the mechanisms of team formation via partner selection for self-organizing teams? In what ways, can these studies advance scholarship focusing on the social psychology of inequality? To establish a foundation for understanding the various studies on team formation, we begin with a general overview on how team and team formation has been conceptualized. Next, we examine the social psychological research on team formation via partner selection. In doing so, we note the importance given to the 4 major mechanisms of team formation emerging from the literature: competence, homophily, familiarity, and affect. Lastly, we conclude the paper with a discussion addressing the research questions guiding this paper and suggest opportunities for social psychologists to consider for future team formation studies.",
The influence of cultural blogs on their readers' cultural product choices,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,Jun 2017,2017,"While some conceptual studies have highlighted the impact that Web 2.0 technology and social media have on cultural industries, empirical evidence is still missing. Specifically, no study has considered the role of cultural bloggers, who mediate the information flows from cultural organizations to consumers. To fill this gap, this paper suggests and tests a model that explains blog readers' intentions to consume cultural products suggested by the blog. The findings from a sample of 215 cultural blog readers show that the impact of the blog on reader intention to consume the products suggested by the blog is strongly influenced by reader engagement with the blog. In addition, the results highlight the effects of content quality, enjoyment, and homophily. The implications of these findings for bloggers and for organizations communicating through bloggers are discussed in detail. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Sources of Segregation in Social Networks: A Novel Approach Using Facebook,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Jun 2017,2017,"Most research on segregation in social networks considers small circles of strong ties, and little is known about segregation among the much larger number of weaker ties. This article proposes a novel approach to the study of these more extended networks, through the use of data on personal ties in an online social network. We illustrate this method's potential by describing and explaining the degree of ethnic and gender segregation on Facebook among a representative survey of adolescents in the Netherlands (N = 2,810; similar to 1.1 million Facebook friends). The results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated by ethnicity than by gender. Drawing on the same survey data, we find that core networks are more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender than are extended networks. However, an exception to this pattern is personal networks of ethnic majority members, whose core networks are as segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. Further analysis suggests this exception is due to their larger population size and the ethnic segregation of their social settings. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of structural opportunities, homophily, and balance.",
Disadvantaged Minorities' Use of the Internet to Expand Their Social Networks,COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,Jun 2017,2017,"An essential argument of the social diversification hypothesis is that disadvantaged groups use the Internet rather than face-to-face communication to broaden social networks, whereas advantaged groups use the Internet to reinforce existing network ties. Previous research in this area has not accounted for both online and off-line communication, has only been examined with cross-sectional data, and has primarily been studied in Israel. To address these gaps with a U.S. data set, 2,669 conversations were analyzed over 6-day periods using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Indeed, unlike participants from racially or educationally advantaged groups, participants who were from a racially marginalized group or lacked college training were more likely to broaden social networks online rather than face-to-face with interracial and weak tie exchanges. This proof of concept of social diversification theory across cultures is the first to use real-time, within-person measures of both race and tie strength.",
Catholic Versus Communist: An Ongoing Issue-The Role of Organizational Affiliation in Accessing the Policy Arena,VOLUNTAS,Jun 2017,2017,"This article analyses the role of organizations' ideological affiliation in shaping information networks within civil society and in granting access to the political sphere. It investigates whether the Catholic and Leftist affiliation of organizations impacts in the city of Turin (Italy) and Kielce (Poland). Applying different social network analysis techniques, the article finds that in both cities there is a tendency towards preferring similar partners. However, while the influence of affiliation is relevant to predict the access to policy making in Turin, in Kielce, this influence is mediated by the actor's centrality in the social sphere. In both cities, networks are characterized by the higher centrality of Catholic organizations, which also translate in a greater involvement in the political sphere. Twenty-five years after the end of the cold war, past-affiliation is still a strong predictor of political involvement and impacts on the shape of local governance structure.",
The Social Structure of Political Echo Chambers: Variation in Ideological Homophily in Online Networks,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,Jun 2017,2017,"We predict that people with different political orientations will exhibit systematically different levels of political homophily, the tendency to associate with others similar to oneself in political ideology. Research on personality differences across the political spectrum finds that both more conservative and more politically extreme individuals tend to exhibit greater orientations towards cognitive stability, clarity, and familiarity. We reason that such a preference for certainty may make these individuals more inclined to seek out the company of those who reaffirm, rather than challenge, their views. Since survey studies of political homophily face well-documented methodological challenges, we instead test this proposition on a large sample of politically engaged users of the social-networking platform Twitter, whose ideologies we infer from the politicians and policy nonprofits they follow. As predicted, we find that both more extreme and more conservative individuals tend to be more homophilous than more liberal and more moderate ones.",
Activist Choice Homophily and the Crowdfunding of Female Founders,ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY,Jun 2017,2017,"In this paper, we examine when members of underrepresented groups choose to support each other, using the context of the funding of female founders via donation-based crowdfunding. Building on theories of choice homophily, we develop the concept of activist choice homophily, in which the basis of attraction between two individuals is not merely similarity between them, but rather perceptions of shared structural barriers stemming from a common social identity based on group membership. We differentiate activist choice homophily from homophily based on the similarity between individuals (""interpersonal choice homophily''), as well as from ""induced homophily,'' which reflects the likelihood that those in a particular social category will affiliate and form networks. Using lab experiments and field data, we show that activist choice homophily provides an explanation for why women are more likely to succeed at crowdfunding than men and why women are most successful in industries in which they are least represented.",
Social media as amplification station: factors that influence the speed of online public response to health emergencies,ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,Jun 2017,2017,"Online public response to health emergencies is a major and complex public health issue. This study employs hierarchical linear modeling to investigate the speed of online users' response to health emergency information on Chinese microblogging sites. The distribution of response speed for all posts is highly skewed. Only a minimal number of posts are forwarded in less than one minute. We further examine the effects of the characteristics of original messages as well as the effects of the factors of reposted messages and information transmitters, to determine the response time of messages on health emergencies. Original messages with different emotional orientations have different response times. The homophily of geographical location among dyadic information transmitters, the addressivity of reposted messages, and the degree of activity and popularity of information transmitters shorten the response time. This study expands the social amplification of risk model to an online context and contributes to the literature on information diffusion by identifying the effects of dyadic relationships among information transmitters. Practical implications are briefly discussed.",
Community partnerships in healthy eating and lifestyle promotion: A network analysis.,Preventive medicine reports,2017-Jun,2017,"Promoting healthy eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources is a complex undertaking that often requires strong partnerships between various agencies. In local communities, these agencies are typically located in different areas, serve diverse subgroups, and operate distinct programs, limiting their communication and interactions with each other. This study assessed the network of agencies in local communities that promote healthy eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources. Network surveys were administered in 2016 among 89 agencies located in 4 rural counties in Michigan that served limited-resource audiences. The agencies were categorized into 8 types: K-12 schools, early childhood centers, emergency food providers, health-related agencies, social resource centers, low-income/subsidized housing complexes, continuing education organizations, and others. Network analysis was conducted to examine 4 network structures-communication, funding, cooperation, and collaboration networks between agencies within each county. Agencies had a moderate level of cooperation, but were only loosely connected in the other 3 networks, indicated by low network density. Agencies in a network were decentralized rather than centralized around a few influential agencies, indicated by low centralization. There was evidence regarding homophily in a network, indicated by some significant correlations within agencies of the same type. Agencies connected in any one network were considerably more likely to be connected in all the other networks as well. In conclusion, promoting healthy eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources warrants strong partnership between agencies in communities. Network analysis serves as a useful tool to evaluate community partnerships and facilitate coalition building.",

Social groups and social network formation,GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR,May 2017,2017,"We present a dynamic model of social network formation in which a fixed number of agents interact in overlapping social groups. We derive several results on the formation of links in such networks, including results on the degree distribution, on comparative statics relating degree and group size, and on the dynamics of homophily. In particular, we derive comparative statics showing that degree is typically positively related to social group size but negatively related to the size of the overlap across multiple social groups. This is supported by evidence from a Facebook dataset. We also show that homophily over an agent's lifespan in the network can be non-monotonic, reaching a global maximum in some period before eventually decreasing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Agent-Based Modeling: A Guide for Social Psychologists,SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE,May 2017,2017,"Agent-based modeling is a long-standing but underused method that allows researchers to simulate artificial worlds for hypothesis testing and theory building. Agent-based models (ABMs) offer unprecedented control and statistical power by allowing researchers to precisely specify the behavior of any number of agents and observe their interactions over time. ABMs are especially useful when investigating group behavior or evolutionary processes and can uniquely reveal nonlinear dynamics and emergence-the process whereby local interactions aggregate into often-surprising collective phenomena such as spatial segregation and relational homophily. We review several illustrative ABMs, describe the strengths and limitations of this method, and address two misconceptions about ABMs: reductionism and ""you get out what you put in."" We also offer maxims for good and bad ABMs, give practical tips for beginner modelers, and include a list of resources and other models. We conclude with a seven-step guide to creating your own model.",
Homophilous Friendship Assortment Based on Personality Traits and Cognitive Ability in Middle Childhood: The Moderating Effect of Peer Network Size,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY,MAY-JUN 2017,2017,"Even though homophily (love of the same) is often thought of as a standard feature of friendships, the empirical evidence for attraction based on personality trait similarity is mixed at best. One reason for the inconsistent findings across studies could be variation in the large-scale social environment in which the studies have been conducted. We investigated whether diversity in the everyday social ecologies of 7- to 8-year-old children (N=549) moderates whether friendships are formed on the basis of similar personality traits and similar levels of Cognitive ability. Moderated polynomial regression and response surface analyses showed that classroom size moderated homophily based on Openness to Experience: children similar in Openness were more likely to form friendship ties, but only in larger classrooms. Moreover, we found homophily for Cognitive ability, especially among girls. The results for Openness and Cognitive ability were independent of each other. We discuss the social relevance of trait Openness and the notion that capacity to reciprocate underlies homophily based on Cognitive ability.

"Co-worker networks, labour mobility and productivity growth in regions",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,May 2017,2017,"The mobility of workers is an important source of regional dynamics, but the effect of mobility on regional productivity growth is not straightforward, as some firms tend to win while others lose from mobility. In the present paper, we argue that the co-worker networks across plants that are established by labour moves are important for both local learning opportunities and job matching quality and should hence facilitate regional growth. We therefore propose a new homophily-biased perspective on co-worker network creation and show that it suits geographical analyses better than random networks do. Moreover, panel vector autoregression models provide systematic evidence that an increase in co-worker network density is positively related to regional productivity growth. This is found to be important even when only ties across plants that are not directly linked by labour mobility are included.",
Do consumers consider Word of Mouth for crucial life decisions?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONPROFIT AND VOLUNTARY SECTOR MARKETING,May 2017,2017,"This study reexamines the Theory of Reasoned Action in a culture with higher uncertainty avoidance and power distance and analyzes how homophily and the ability (expertise) of word of mouth (WOM) sources impacts on the consumer attitudes and purchase decisions with respect to such high-risk credence products as college selection. By using an interpretivist approach to model building, the study comprises 41 interviews, finding that WOM made a significant impact on attitudes but not on purchase behaviors. Homophily with friends was regarded as an important factor at the search stage, but strong ties were more important in the purchasing of the product. Expertise and the credibility of the WOM played a significant role in generating trust in WOM, resulting in attitude change, although with a minimal impact on purchase behavior. The article concludes with implications for practice.",
"Region of Origin: Settlement Decisions of Turkish and Iranian Immigrants in Sweden, 1968-2001",POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE,May 2017,2017,"This paper focuses on the residential resettlement decisions of a sample of immigrants from Iran and Turkey living in Sweden between 1968 and 2001. Using the Swedish Longitudinal Immigrant database, we are able to link unique pre- and post-migration data to understand whether region of origin is a better predictor of internal migration decisions than is country of origin, the more often used measure in existing research. More specifically, we test whether living in municipalities with a high number of individuals from the same country of origin is a similar phenomenon as a high number of individuals from the same region of origin. This is relevant, as large immigrant groups come from ethnically, religiously, and linguistically heterogeneous countries of origin where regional characteristics differ according to aforementioned aspects from that of the mainstream population. We indeed find that individuals are less likely to relocate from municipalities in which there is a large presence of other immigrants from the same region of origin. Instead, individuals residing in areas with a large number of individuals from their country of origin are observed with an elevated probability of resettlement.

Reach and speed of judgment propagation in the laboratory,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Apr 18 2017,2017,"In recent years, a large body of research has demonstrated that judgments and behaviors can propagate from person to person. Phenomena as diverse as political mobilization, health practices, altruism, and emotional states exhibit similar dynamics of social contagion. The precise mechanisms of judgment propagation are not well understood, however, because it is difficult to control for confounding factors such as homophily or dynamic network structures. We introduce an experimental design that renders possible the stringent study of judgment propagation. In this design, experimental chains of individuals can revise their initial judgment in a visual perception task after observing a predecessor's judgment. The positioning of a very good performer at the top of a chain created a performance gap, which triggered waves of judgment propagation down the chain. We evaluated the dynamics of judgment propagation experimentally. Despite strong social influence within pairs of individuals, the reach of judgment propagation across a chain rarely exceeded a social distance of three to four degrees of separation. Furthermore, computer simulations showed that the speed of judgment propagation decayed exponentially with the social distance from the source. We show that information distortion and the overweighting of other people's errors are two individual-level mechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain. Our results contribute to the understanding of social-contagion processes, and our experimental method offers numerous new opportunities to study judgment propagation in the laboratory.",
Sustainable use of renewable resources in a stylized social-ecological network model under heterogeneous resource distribution,EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS,Apr 11 2017,2017,"Human societies depend on the resources ecosystems provide. Particularly since the last century, human activities have transformed the relationship between nature and society at a global scale. We study this coevolutionary relationship by utilizing a stylized model of private resource use and social learning on an adaptive network. The latter process is based on two social key dynamics beyond economic paradigms: boundedly rational imitation of resource use strategies and homophily in the formation of social network ties. The private and logistically growing resources are harvested with either a sustainable (small) or non-sustainable (large) effort. We show that these social processes can have a profound influence on the environmental state, such as determining whether the private renewable resources collapse from overuse or not. Additionally, we demonstrate that heterogeneously distributed regional resource capacities shift the critical social parameters where this resource extraction system collapses. We make these points to argue that, in more advanced coevolutionary models of the planetary social-ecological system, such socio-cultural phenomena as well as regional resource heterogeneities should receive attention in addition to the processes represented in established Earth system and integrated assessment models.",
The Indian exception: the densification of the network of corporate interlocks and the specificities of the Indian business system (2000-2012),SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,Apr 2017,2017,"This article attempts to explain the peculiar evolution of the topology of the Indian interlocking directorates network during the periods of liberalization and corporate governance reforms. A study of interlocks among the top 50, 100 and 250 National Stock Exchange of Bombay companies in 2000 and 2012 shows that the Indian network does not follow the global trend of other 'fracturing' and 'disintegrating' corporate networks. Our results in fact show a resistance to homogenizing forces: the density of the network increases over the years, and banks and financial institutions do not play a major role in creating ties between boards. On the contrary, regional, business group, caste and family ties remain prevalent and shape a strongly embedded 'inner circle'. In particular, the growing density of the network seems to be accounted for, to a large extent, by the driving role of family-led business groups and of independent big linkers.",
Multilayer dynamics of complex spatial networks: The case of global maritime flows (1977-2008),JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,Apr 2017,2017,"This article investigates the degree of overlap among the different layers of circulation composing global maritime flows in recent decades. Mobilizing several methods originating from complex networks allows us to shed new light on specialization and diversification dynamics affecting the evolution of ports and shipping. The principal confirm the strong and path-dependent influence of multiplexity on traffic volume, range of interaction and centrality from various perspectives, such as matrices correlations, homophily, assortativity, and single linkage analysis. While the network grows and concentrates around large hubs over time, traffic distribution is also place-dependent due to the reinforced position of already established nodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Allocative Failures: Networks and Institutions in International Grantmaking Relationships,VOLUNTAS,Apr 2017,2017,"Using neo-institutional theory to guide my inquiry, I ask how foundations award international development grants in an institutionally complex environment, and if and how that process contributes to homophily in grantmaking. Employing a qualitative multiple case study method, I show that grants are awarded via interpersonal networks, a meso-level finding that suggests a second, macro-level research question: how are interpersonal networks institutionalized in this context? In my analysis, I contribute to a theoretical understanding of the recursive relationship between networks and institutions: I show how macro-level institutional practices and forms emerge from networks, and how the micro-level character of the network participants themselves ultimately shapes institutional forms. Combined, my results provide a mechanistic, multi-level understanding of the relationship between networks and institutions, as well as of how homophily operates in grantmaking. Because of the potential for social stratification and exclusion based on the structure of the network itself, I argue that such networks should be understood as ""allocative failures.''",
Are Immigrants Really Lacking Social Networking Skills? The Crucial Role of Reciprocity in Building Ethnically Diverse Networks,SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION,Apr 2017,2017,"Increasing ethnic and social diversity in cities does not translate into diverse networks of urbanites. Particularly for white middle-classes in gentrified neighbourhoods, there is evidence on boundary drawing to ` unwanted groups' such as ethnic minorities and lower-classes. Rarely have these studies focused on the networks of ethnic minorities, the actual diversity-bringers. I will contribute to the understanding of why and under what circumstances diversity in neighbourhoods gets translated into people's daily practices, hence also networks, by analysing those of middle-class TurkishGermans in Berlin. Based on interviews and network analysis, I will show that a neighbourhood's ethnic diversity, fellow residents' attitudes towards diversity and the built environment play an important role in building category-crossing ties. Owing to a lack of reciprocity in establishing ties, Turkish-Germans in neighbourhoods with a high share of native-Germans actually have more ties to Turks than those in a more diverse neighbourhood.",
Research: Gender bias in scholarly peer review,ELIFE,Mar 21 2017,2017,"Peer review is the cornerstone of scholarly publishing and it is essential that peer reviewers are appointed on the basis of their expertise alone. However, it is difficult to check for any bias in the peer-review process because the identity of peer reviewers generally remains confidential. Here, using public information about the identities of 9000 editors and 43000 reviewers from the Frontiers series of journals, we show that women are underrepresented in the peer-review process, that editors of both genders operate with substantial same-gender preference (homophily), and that the mechanisms of this homophily are gender-dependent. We also show that homophily will persist even if numerical parity between genders is reached, highlighting the need for increased efforts to combat subtler forms of gender bias in scholarly publishing.",
Two-phase network generation towards within-network classifiers evaluation,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,Mar 15 2017,2017,"Within-network classifiers have been widely used to predict unknown data in networks. In order to evaluate the performance of existing classifiers, it is essential to generate synthetic networks with various properties. However, conventional network generation methods become ineffective under this scenario, since they are unable to produce node labels, exert topological constraints, or provide stable generation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel network generation method for evaluating within-network classifiers, which consists of two generation phases. In the first phase of topology generation, network topology can be obtained by incorporating any existing topology generation models. In the second phase of label generation, we model the problem as a multi-objective optimization. Specifically, we prove that generating node labels over an existing topology conforming homophily constraint is NP-hard, and devise a genetic algorithm based strategy for node label generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce synthetic networks with stable properties, and ensure that the network topology is fixed and label parameters take effect independently, thus making it sufficient for evaluating the sensitivity of classifiers against different parameters.

Assessing the Network of Agencies in Local Communities that Promote Healthy Eating and Lifestyles among Populations with Limited Resources,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR,Mar 2017,2017,"Objectives: We assessed the network of agencies in local communities that promote healthy eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources. Methods: Network surveys were administered among 159 Illinois agencies identified as serving limited-resource audiences categorized into 8 types: K-12 schools, early childhood centers, emergency food providers, health-related agencies, social resource centers, low-income/subsidized housing complexes, continuing education organizations, and others. Network analysis was conducted to examine 4 network structures - communications, funding, cooperation, and collaboration networks between agencies within each county/county cluster. Results: Agencies in a network were found to be loosely connected, indicated by low network density. Reporting accuracy might be of concern, indicated by low reciprocity. Agencies in a network are decentralized rather than centralized around a few influential agencies, indicated by low betweenness centrality. There is suggestive evidence regarding homophily in a network, indicated by some significant correlations within agencies of the same type. Agencies connected in one network are significantly more likely to be connected in all the other networks as well. Conclusions: Promoting healthy eating and lifestyles among populations with limited resources warrants strong partnership across agencies in communities. Network analysis serves as a useful tool to evaluate community partnerships and facilitate coalition building..",
From Acquaintances to Friends: Homophily and Learning in Networks,IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS,Mar 2017,2017,"This paper considers the evolution of a network in a discrete time, stochastic setting in which agents learn about each other through repeated interactions and maintain/break links on the basis of what they learn. Agents exhibit homophily, the preference to link with others who are similar to themselves, and they have a limited capacity for links. They thus maintain links with others learned to be similar to themselves and cut links to those learned to be dissimilar to themselves. We introduce a new equilibrium concept we term ""matching pairwise stable equilibrium"", and we prove that such equilibrium is unique in our model. We show that higher levels of homophily decrease the (average) number of links that agents form. However, the effect of homophily is anomalous: mutually beneficial links may be dropped before learning is completed, thereby resulting in sparser networks and less clustering than under complete information. Homophily also exhibits an interesting interaction with the presence of incomplete information: initially, greater levels of homophily increase the difference between the complete and incomplete information networks, but sufficiently high levels of homophily eventually decrease the difference. Complete and incomplete information networks differ most when the degree of homophily is intermediate.",
Advocacy Coalitions in Ontario Land Use Policy Development,REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH,Mar 2017,2017,"In 2005, the Ontario government passed the Places to Grow Act and the Greenbelt Act, both major changes in land use policy designed to preserve greenspaces and combat urban sprawl in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Canada's largest conurbation. This article examines the actors, actor beliefs, and inter-actor alliances in the southern Ontario land use policy subsystem from the perspective of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF). Specifically, this paper undertakes an empirical examination of the ACF's Belief Homophily Hypothesis, which holds that inter-actor alliances form on the basis of shared policy-relevant beliefs, creating advocacy coalitions. The analysis finds strong evidence of three advocacy coalitions in the policy subsysteman agricultural coalition, an environmentalist coalition, and a developers' coalitionas predicted by the hypothesis. However, it also finds equally strong evidence of a cross-coalition coordination network of peak organizations, something not predicted by the Belief Homophily Hypothesis, and in need of explanation within the ACF.",
The Origins of Religious Homophily in a Medium and Large School,REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH,Mar 2017,2017,"How religion influences social interactions, and how social interactions influence religion, are fundamental questions to the sociology of religion. We address these processes and build on Cheadle and Schwadel's (Soc Sci Res 41: 1198-1212, 2012) analysis of selection and influence in religion-based social tie homogeneity (i.e. network-religion autocorrelation) in small schools by analyzing networks from larger schools, by focusing on differences across schools, and by testing different operationalizations of social influence. Using two waves of full network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and dynamic longitudinal network SIENA models, we find (1) that both selection and influence impact network-religion autocorrelation; (2) that the factors influencing network-religion autocorrelation vary across school contexts; and (3) that religious influence is proportional to the number of friends in an adolescent's network, which means influence reflects both the size of an individual's network and the consistency of religion among members of the network. We conclude by addressing potential reasons for differences across school contexts and by discussing the theoretical logic behind the total similarity effect that best operationalized religious influence.",
"Ten Million Readers Can't be Wrong!, or Can They? On the Role of Information About Adoption Stock in New Product Trial",MARKETING SCIENCE,MAR-APR 2017,2017,"Most new-product frameworks in marketing and economics, as well as lay beliefs and practices, hold that the larger the stock of adoption of a new product, the greater the likelihood of additional adoption. Less is known about the underlying mechanisms as well as the conditions under which this central assumption holds. We use a series of field and consequential choice experiments to demonstrate the existence of nonpositive and even negative effects of large adoption stock information on the likelihood of subsequent adoption. The results highlight the degree of homophily with the adopting stock as well as the level of customer uncertainty as key characteristics determining the nature of the effect of stock information. In particular, information about a large existing adoption stock generates a positive effect on adoption only under moderate customer uncertainty combined with sufficient homophily; in other levels of uncertainty and/or homophily we find effects ranging from null to negative. This is the first direct test and demonstration of the intricate role of information about a large stock of adoption in the new product diffusion process, and it carries direct implications for marketers.",
"The interplay of spatial diffusion and marital assimilation of Mexicans in the United States, 1980-2011",JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,Mar 2017,2017,"Recent trends suggest a decline in the rate of intermarriage between Mexicans and non-Hispanic whites. In this paper, we argue that interpretations of this trend as a decline in preferences for intermarriage are misleading because of the lack of adequate data that captures both spatial and temporal variation in the level of intergroup contact. Using data from the Decennial Census (1980-2000) and the American Community Survey (2008-2011), we employ a novel methodological approach to disentangle the impact of spatial diffusion, ethnic replenishment, and shifts in preferences for homophily on Mexican ethnic intermarriage patterns across 543 Consistent Public Use Microdata Areas (c-PUMA). Once changes in the demographic composition of c-PUMAs are accounted for, multilevel models for repeated cross-sectional data provide no evidence of a change in the marital preferences of Mexicans over time. Trends in intermarriage rates are predominantly explained by compositional and structural changes.",
Effect of homophily on network formation,COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION,Mar 2017,2017,"Although there is much research on network formation based on the preferential attachment rule, the research did not come up with a formula that, on the one hand, can reproduce shapes of cumulative degree distributions of empirical complex networks and, on the other hand, can represent intuitively theories on individual behavior. In this paper, we propose a formula that closes this gap by integrating into the formula for the preferential attachment rule (i.e., a node with higher degree is more likely to gain a new link) a representation of the theory of individual behavior with respect to nodes preferring to connect to other nodes with similar attributes (i.e., homophily). Based on this formula, we simulate the shapes of cumulative degree distributions for different levels of homophily and five different seed networks. Our simulation results suggest that homophily and the preferential attachment rule interact for all five types of seed networks. Surprisingly, the resulting cumulative degree distribution in log-log scale always shifts from a concave shape to a convex shape, as the level of homophily gets larger. Therefore, our formula can explain intuitively why some of the empirical complex networks show a linear cumulative degree distribution in log-log scale while others show either a concave or convex shape. Furthermore, another major finding indicates that homophily makes people of a group richer than people outside this group, which is a surprising and significant finding. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Social Differentiation in Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that Engage in Human-Related Foraging Behaviors,PLOS ONE,Feb 1 2017,2017,"Both natural and human-related foraging strategies by the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) have resulted in social segregation in several areas of the world. Bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia beg at an unprecedented rate and also forage behind commercial shrimp trawlers, providing an opportunity to study the social ramifications of two human-related foraging behaviors within the same group of animals. Dolphins were photo-identified via surveys conducted throughout estuarine waterways around Savannah in the summers of 2009-2011. Mean half-weight indices (HWI) were calculated for each foraging class, and community division by modularity was used to cluster animals based on association indices. Pairs of trawler dolphins had a higher mean HWI (0.20 +/- 0.07) than pairs of non-trawler dolphins (0.04 +/- 0.02) or mixed pairs (0.02 +/- 0.02). In contrast, pairs of beggars, non-beggars, and mixed pairs all had similar means, with HWI between 0.05 +/- 0.07. Community division by modularity produced a useful division (0.307) with 6 clusters. Clusters were predominately divided according to trawler status; however, beggars and non-beggars were mixed throughout clusters. Both the mean HWI and social clusters revealed that the social structure of common bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia was differentiated based on trawler status but not beg status. This finding may indicate that foraging in association with trawlers is a socially learned behavior, while the mechanisms for the propagation of begging are less clear. This study highlights the importance of taking into account the social parameters of a foraging behavior, such as how group size or competition for resources may affect how the behavior spreads. The positive or negative ramifications of homophily may influence whether the behaviors are exhibited by individuals within the same social clusters and should be considered in future studies examining social relationships and foraging behaviors.",
Ruling out static latent homophily in citation networks,SCIENTOMETRICS,Feb 2017,2017,"Citation and coauthor networks offer an insight into the dynamics of scientific progress. We can also view them as representations of a causal structure, a logical process captured in a graph. From a causal perspective, we can ask questions such as whether authors form groups primarily due to their prior shared interest, or if their favourite topics are 'contagious' and spread through co-authorship. Such networks have been widely studied by the artificial intelligence community, and recently a connection has been made to nonlocal correlations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics-the impact of latent hidden variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric methodology that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a causal graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a manifestation of prior shared interest only, leading to the observed patternedness. By introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we add a new tool to existing methods for the analysis of content-related social influences.",
Stochastic actor-oriented modeling for studying homophily and social influence in OSS projects,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,Feb 2017,2017,"Open Source Software projects are communities in which people ""learn the ropes"" from each other. The social and technical activities of developers evolve together, and as they link to each other they get organized in a network of changing socio-technical connections. Traces of those activities, or behaviors, are typically visible to all, in project repositories and through communication between them. Thus, in principle it may be possible to study those traces to tell which of the observable socio-technical behaviors of developers in these projects are responsible for the forming of persistent links between them. It may also be possible to tell the extent to which links participate in the spread of potential behavioral influences. Since OSS projects change in both social and technical activity over time, static approaches, that either ignore time or simplify it to a few slices, are frequently inadequate to study these networks. On the other hand, ad-hoc dynamic approaches are often only loosely supported by theory and can yield misleading findings. Here we adapt the stochastic actor-oriented models from social network analysis. These models enable the study of the interplay between behavior, influence and network architecture, for dynamic networks, in a statistically sound way. We apply the stochastic actor-oriented models in case studies of two Apache Software Foundation projects, and study code ownership and developer productivity as behaviors. For those, we find evidence of significant social selection effects (homophily) in both projects, but in different directions. However, we find no evidence for the spread (social influence) of either code ownership or developer productivity behaviors through the networks.",
"Intra- and Inter-group Friendship Choices of Christian, Muslim, and Non-religious Youth in Germany",EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Feb 2017,2017,"In contemporary Western Europe, both scholars and the public discuss the consequences of a rising share of a comparatively religious Muslim population for societal coexistence. Yet we know surprisingly little about how religion and religiosity shape social relationships. Focusing on adolescents' friendship networks, we examine how religion and religiosity affect intra-and inter-group friendship choices. While youth should generally prefer to befriend peers of the same religion, this religious homophily should be more pronounced for highly than for less religious youth. Against the background of rising anti-Muslim attitudes in Europe, Christian and non-religious youth further may be particularly hesitant to befriend Muslim peers, and especially highly religious ones. We analysed three waves of German longitudinal friendship network data from ethnically diverse schools. Regarding intra-group friendships, while Muslim youth indeed preferred to befriend Muslim peers, Christian youth displayed no evidence of religious homophily. For Muslims, higher levels of religiosity further increased this preference. Regarding inter-group friendships, irrespective of their individual religiosity, Muslim youth were socially divided from their non-Muslim peers, as both Christian and nonreligious youth were reluctant to befriend Muslim peers. In sum, in the German context, religion itself rather than religiosity seems to matter most for adolescents' friendship choices.",
Predicting international Facebook ties through cultural homophily and other factors,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Feb 2017,2017,"This study describes the structure of the international Facebook friendship network and its determinants using various predictors, including physical proximity, cultural homophily, and communication. Network analysis resulted in one group of nations, with countries that bridge geographic and linguistic clusters (France, Spain, United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates) being the most central. Countries with international Facebook friendship ties tended to share borders, language, civilization, and migration. Physical distance, shared hyperlinks, use of common websites, telephone traffic, cultural similarity, and international student exchange were either weakly or not significantly related to international Facebook friendships.",
Will They Come and Will They Stay? Online Social Networks and News Consumption on External Websites,JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MARKETING,Feb 2017,2017,"This study explores the role of online engagement, homophily and social influence in explaining traffic and news consumption by social network users at an external news website. The authors jointly model visits and page views for a panel of users who registered with the news site using their Facebook accounts. In their model, the authors account for homophily using a latent space approach, and account for endogeneity, heterogeneity, and unobservable correlates. The results show that measures of an individual's activity on Facebook are positively associated with that individual's actions at the news site. In addition, knowing what a user's Facebook friends do at the content website provides insights into a focal user's behavior at that website, as visitors with friends who visit external news sites are more likely to visit the news website studied. In addition, news consumption (not just visits) also depends on friend's actions but such an impact varies with the individual's underlying browsing mode. We highlight the importance of social influence in news consumption and further show that homophily bias in news consumption is similar to prior research in other categories. Our study also highlights that visitors' past browsing patterns are important predictors of future content consumption, although social network information significantly improves prediction beyond the effect of such more traditional behavioral metrics. Finally we find that Managers can use readily available data for both prediction and targeting. (C) 2017 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc., dba Marketing EDGE. All rights reserved.",
Understanding interactions in virtual HIV communities: a social network analysis approach,AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV,Feb 2017,2017,"This study investigated the driving mechanism of building interaction ties among the people living with HIV/AIDS in one of the largest virtual HIV communities in China using social network analysis. Specifically, we explained the probability of forming interaction ties with homophily and popularity characteristics. The exponential random graph modeling results showed that members in this community tend to form homophilous ties in terms of shared location and interests. Moreover, we found a tendency away from popularity effect. This suggests that in this community, resources and information were not disproportionally received by a few of members, which could be beneficial to the overall community.",
Dynamics of self-control in egocentric social networks,PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES,Feb 1 2017,2017,"People with high self-control have frequent short-term and long-term goal success. These successes stem from both reactive and proactive self-regulatory processes, including maneuvering their social relationships to interact more frequently with other people who are also high in self-control. One implication of this idea is that higher levels of self-control should mark the social networks of people with high self-control. The present study tested and found support for this hypothesis. Furthermore, within networks (a) friends with high self-control were more likely to be connected to each other (i.e., homophily) and (b) friends with relatively high (vs. low) self-control were more valued by participants, and particularly by participants with high self-control. The results provide external validity for the idea that individuals with high self-control are more likely to find themselves in and prefer social situations that are characterized by high self-control. These effects may be a result of network contagion or they may reflect strategic development of social networks that support self-control and goal outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Gratifications of using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat to follow brands: The moderating effect of social comparison, trust, tie strength, and network homophily on brand identification, brand engagement, brand commitment, and membership intention",TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS,Feb 2017,2017,"Applying uses and gratifications theory (UGT), this study examined consumers' use of one of four social networking sites (SNSs): Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat, for following brands, and their influence on brand community-related outcomes. Results (N=297) indicated Snapchat users scored highest for passing time, sharing problems, and improving social knowledge, while Instagram users scored highest for showing affection, following fashion, and demonstrating sociability. Twitter users had highest brand community identification and membership intention, while Instagram users had highest brand community engagement and commitment. Attention to social comparison, SNS trust, tie strength, and homophily also significantly moderated the relationship between frequent use of each SNS to follow brands, and brand community-related outcomes. Implications for future research on SNS users' goal-directed consumption behaviors are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Excellence R Us: university research and the fetishisation of excellence,PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS,Jan 19 2017,2017,"The rhetoric of ""excellence"" is pervasive across the academy. It is used to refer to research outputs as well as researchers, theory and education, individuals and organizations, from art history to zoology. But does ""excellence"" actually mean anything? Does this pervasive narrative of ""excellence"" do any good? Drawing on a range of sources we interrogate ""excellence"" as a concept and find that it has no intrinsic meaning in academia. Rather it functions as a linguistic interchange mechanism. To investigate whether this linguistic function is useful we examine how the rhetoric of excellence combines with narratives of scarcity and competition to show that the hyper-competition that arises from the performance of ""excellence"" is completely at odds with the qualities of good research. We trace the roots of issues in reproducibility, fraud, and homophily to this rhetoric. But we also show that this rhetoric is an internal, and not primarily an external, imposition. We conclude by proposing an alternative rhetoric based on soundness and capacity-building. In the final analysis, it turns out that that ""excellence"" is not excellent. Used in its current unqualified form it is a pernicious and dangerous rhetoric that undermines the very foundations of good research and scholarship. This article is published as part of a collection on the future of research assessment.",
Information exchange networks of health care providers and evidence-based cardiovascular risk management: an observational study,IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE,Jan 13 2017,2017,"Background: Although a wide range of preventive and clinical interventions has targeted cardiovascular risk management (CVRM), outcomes remain suboptimal. Therefore, the question is what additional determinants of CVRM and outcomes can be identified and addressed to optimize CVRM. In this study, we aimed to identify new perspectives for improving healthcare delivery and explored associations between information exchange networks of health care providers and evidence-based CVRM.Methods: This observational study was performed parallel to a randomized clinical trial which aimed to improve professional performance of practice nurses in the Netherlands. Information exchange on medical policy for CVRM (""general information networks"") and CVRM for individual patients (""specific information networks"") of 180 health professionals in 31 general practices was measured with personalized questionnaires. Medical record audit was performed concerning 1620 patients in these practices to document quality of care delivery and two risk factors (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and LDL cholesterol level). Hypothesized effects of five network characteristics (density, frequency of contact, centrality of CVRM-coordinators, homophily on positive attitudes for treatment target achievement, and presence of an opinion leader for CVRM) constructed on both general and specific information exchange networks were tested and controlled for practice and patient factors using logistic multilevel analyses.Results: Odds for adequate performance were enhanced in practices with an opinion leader for CVRM (OR 2.75, p <.05). Odds for achievement of SBP targets were reduced in practices who had networks with low homophily on positive attitudes for SBP and LDL targets (homophily for SBP targets OR 0.57, p <.05 and OR 0.60, p <.05, homophily for LDL targets OR 0.59, p <.05 and OR 0.61, p <.05 in general and specific information networks, respectively). No effects of network characteristics on cholesterol were found.Conclusions: Delivery of evidence-based CVRM is associated with homophily of clinical attitudes and presence of opinion leaders in primary care teams. These results signal the potential of social networks to be taken into account in further attempts to improve the implementation of evidence-based care for CVRM. Future research is needed to identify and formulate optimal strategies for using opinion leaders to improve CVRM. Future interventions may be more effective if they target a common vision on CVRM within practices.",
Balancing information exposure in social networks,ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 30 (NIPS 2017),2017,2017,"Social media has brought a revolution on how people are consuming news. Beyond the undoubtedly large number of advantages brought by social-media platforms, a point of criticism has been the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, caused by social homophily and algorithmic personalization.In this paper we address the problem of balancing the information exposure in a social network. We assume that two opposing campaigns (or viewpoints) are present in the network, and that network nodes have different preferences towards these campaigns. Our goal is to find two sets of nodes to employ in the respective campaigns, so that the overall information exposure for the two campaigns is balanced. We formally define the problem, characterize its hardness, develop approximation algorithms, and present experimental evaluation results.Our model is inspired by the literature on influence maximization, but there are significant differences from the standard model. First, balance of information exposure is modeled by a symmetric difference function, which is neither monotone nor submodular, and thus, not amenable to existing approaches. Second, while previous papers consider a setting with selfish agents and provide bounds on best-response strategies (i.e., move of the last player), we consider a setting with a centralized agent and provide bounds for a global objective function.",
The weakness of weak ties for novel information diffusion.,Applied network science,2017,2017,"Weak ties are thought to facilitate the diffusion of information through social networks because of their tendency to span otherwise distant subgroups. However, this logic assumes that weak relationships have the same capacity to transmit information as those that are strong. I argue that weak ties, especially the kind that span subgroups, are often also lower-capacity. Due to a lack of trust, an unwillingness to share benefits, or a limited ability to understand one another, an individual is less likely to share novel information across these ties. In standard models of diffusion imported from epidemiology, even reduced-capacity links would still aid diffusion. However, accounting for reduced capacity in a new model of diffusion that captures realistic features of information sharing in human groups, I demonstrate that hesitation to share across weak links substantially impedes overall diffusion. Moreover, I show that the addition of weak ties to a social network can strictly reduce the extent and speed of information diffusion. Increasing density by adding weak ties can make diffusion strictly worse by crowding out the use of higher-capacity ties. I present the results of simulated information diffusion on both hypothetical networks generated to possess varying levels of density and homophily, as well as on real social networks in two Ugandan villages shown to be responsible for face-to-face information sharing.",
Modeling Check-In Behavior with Geographical Neighborhood Influence of Venues,"ADVANCED DATA MINING AND APPLICATIONS, ADMA 2017",2017,2017,"With many users adopting location-based social networks (LBSNs) to share their daily activities, LBSNs become a gold mine for researchers to study human check-in behavior. Modeling such behavior can benefit many useful applications such as urban planning and location-aware recommender systems. Unlike previous studies [4,6,12,17] that focus on the effect of distance on users checking in venues, we consider two venue-specific effects of geographical neighborhood influence, namely, spatial homophily and neighborhood competition. The former refers to the fact that venues share more common features with their spatial neighbors, while the latter captures the rivalry of a venue and its nearby neighbors in order to gain visitation from users. In this paper, through an extensive empirical study, we show that these two geographical effects, together with social homophily, play significant roles in understanding users' check-in behaviors. From the observation, we then propose to model users' check-in behavior by incorporating these effects into a matrix factorization-based framework. To evaluate our proposed models, we conduct check-in prediction task and show that our models outperform the baselines. Furthermore, we discover that neighborhood competition effect has more impact to the users' check-in behavior than spatial homophily. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that quantitatively examine the two effects of geographical neighborhood influence on users' check-in behavior.",
Content-Based Social Recommendation with Poisson Matrix Factorization,"MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATABASES, ECML PKDD 2017, PT I",2017,2017,"We introduce Poisson Matrix Factorization with Content and Social trust information (PoissonMF-CS), a latent variable probabilistic model for recommender systems with the objective of jointly modeling social trust, item content and user's preference using Poisson matrix factorization framework. This probabilistic model is equivalent to collectively factorizing a non-negative user-item interaction matrix and a non-negative item-content matrix. The user-item matrix consists of sparse implicit (or explicit) interactions counts between user and item, and the item-content matrix consists of words or tags counts per item. The model imposes additional constraints given by the social ties between users, and the homophily effect on social networks-the tendency of people with similar preferences to be socially connected. Using this model we can account for and fine-tune the weight of content-based and social-based factors in the user preference. We develop approximate variational inference algorithm and perform experiments comparing PoissonMFCS with competing models. The experimental evaluation indicates that PoissonMF-CS achieves superior predictive performance on held-out data for the top-M recommendations task. Also, we observe that PoissonMFCS generates compact latent representations when compared with alternative models while maintaining superior predictive performance.",
Users Are Known by the Company They Keep: Topic Models for Viewpoint Discovery in Social Networks,CIKM'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,2017,2017,"S ocial media platforms such as weblogs and social networking sites provide Internet users with an unprecedented means to express their opinions and debate on a wide range of issues. Concurrently with their growing importance in public communication, social media platforms may foster echo chambers and filter bubbles: homophily and content personalization lead users to be increasingly exposed to conforming opinions. There is therefore a need for unbiased systems able to identify and provide access to varied viewpoints. To address this task, we propose in this paper a novel unsupervised topic model, the Social Network Viewpoint Discovery Model (SNVDM). Given a specific issue (e.g., U.S. policy) as well as the text and social interactions from the users discussing this issue on a social networking site, SNVDM jointly identifies the issue's topics, the users' viewpoints, and the discourse pertaining to the different topics and viewpoints. In order to overcome the potential sparsity of the social network (i.e., some users interact with only a few other users), we propose an extension to SNVDM based on the Generalized Polya Urn sampling scheme (SNVDM-GPU) to leverage ""acquaintances of acquaintances"" relationships. We benchmark the different proposed models against three baselines, namely TAM, SN-LDA, and VODUM, on a viewpoint clustering task using two real-world datasets. We thereby provide evidence that our model SNVDM and its extension SNVDM-GPU significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines, and we show that utilizing social interactions greatly improves viewpoint clustering performance.",
Incorporating the Latent Link Categories in Relational Topic Modeling,CIKM'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,2017,2017,"The soaring of social media services has greatly propelled the prevalence of document networks. Rather than a set of plain texts, documents are nodes in graphs. An observable link connects the documents at its two ends, thus it implicitly reflects the semantic association between the document pair. Previous work assumes that only similar documents tend to be connected, which neglects the rich connective patterns in the topological structure. In this paper, we introduce a latent correlation factor to categorize the links into several categories, and each category corresponds to a unique kind of association. By fitting the data, the relational information (e.g., homophily and heterophily) can be comprehensively captured. By resorting to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), we maximize the correlation between all pairs of linked documents. We propose a pure generative model and derive efficient learning algorithms based on the variational EM methods. Experiments on three different datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive and usually better than the state-of-the-art baselines on both topic modeling and link prediction.",
Nationality Classification Using Name Embeddings,CIKM'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,2017,2017,"Nationality identification unlocks important demographic information, with many applications in biomedical and sociological research. Existing name-based nationality classifiers use name sub strings as features and are trained on small, unrepresentative sets of labeled names, typically extracted from Wikipedia. As a result, these methods achieve limited performance and cannot support fine-grained classification.We exploit the phenomena of homophily in communication patterns to learn name embeddings, a new representation that encodes gender, ethnicity, and nationality which is readily applicable to building classifiers and other systems. Through our analysis of 57M contact lists from a major Internet company, we are able to design a fine-grained nationality classifier covering 39 groups representing over 90% of the world population. In an evaluation against other published systems over 13 common classes, our Fl score (0.795) is substantial better than our closest competitor Ethnea (0.580). To the best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate, fine-grained nationality classifier available.As a social media application, we apply our classifiers to the followers of major Twitter celebrities over six different domains. We demonstrate stark differences in the ethnicities of the followers of Trump and Obama, and in the sports and entertainments favored by different groups. Finally, we identify an anomalous political figure whose presumably inflated following appears largely incapable of reading the language he posts in.",
Geographic and Temporal Trends in Fake News Consumption During the 2016 US Presidential Election,CIKM'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,2017,2017,"We present an analysis of traffic to websites known for publishing fake news in the months preceding the 2016 US presidential election. The study is based on the combined instrumentation data from two popular desktop web browsers: Internet Explorer 11 and Edge. We find that social media was the primary outlet for the circulation of fake news stories and that aggregate voting patterns were strongly correlated with the average daily fraction of users visiting websites serving fake news. This correlation was observed both at the state level and at the county level, and remained stable throughout the main election season. We propose a simple model based on homophily in social networks to explain the linear association. Finally, we highlight examples of different types of fake news stories: while certain stories continue to circulate in the population, others are short-lived and die out in a few days.",
Evidence of complex contagion of information in social media: An experiment using Twitter bots,Figshare,2018-02-13,2017,"It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using social bots deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques.

Bidirectional label propagation for community detection,2017 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SCIENCE AND CONTROL ENGINEERING (ICISCE),2017,2017,"In complex networks, communities often show the presence of homophily between members, since homophily is the tendency of individuals to associate and bound with similar others to form densely interconnected groups. In this paper, we propose a new bidirectional label propagation community detection algorithm, called Dis-Sim, based on the fundamental idea that a node and its most similar neighbors belong to the same community, while a node and its most dissimilar neighbors belong to different communities. The proposed algorithm depends on the network structure alone and explores the dissimilarity and similarity between each pair of nodes to identify the communities. The dissimilarity measure will separate nodes into different groups, while the similarity measure will merge nodes into clusters. The empirical experiments on real-world networks against state-of-the-art algorithms are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results confirm its effectiveness and computational efficiency.",
Modeling Chinese Consumer Responses to a Vignette Television Commercial Drama for a Vacation Resort,JOURNAL OF CHINA TOURISM RESEARCH,2017,2017,"This study involved the formulation and testing of a model of Chinese consumers' cognitive and affective responses to a vignette television commercial drama for a vacation resort area on the South China Sea. Results indicate that response to the commercial was cognitive in nature with perceived homophily, sympathy, beliefs and attitude toward the ad partially mediating the influence of perceived verisimilitude on attitude toward the brand. Unexpectedly, empathy did not play a mediating role. Possible reasons for this, including cultural factors, are discussed. The results also suggest that to effectively promote tourism services a commercial's production value and realism must be high to produce sufficient verisimilitude. In addition, the behavior and appearance of the actors chosen for the commercial should match those of the intended target audience in order to produce sufficient homophily.",
"Happy Tourists, Unhappy Locals",Rutgers University Community Repository,2018-04-19,2017,"The most recent of literature focuses more often on the happiness of tourists, rather than the happiness of residents affected by tourism. However, this study aims at filling this gap with a new and refreshing perspective. This is carried out by using the European Social Survey (2010-2012) merged with Eurostat tourism data at the province (NUTS2) level. Staying consistent with homophily or ingroup preference theories, we find that domestic tourists contribute more to the happiness of locals than foreign tourists. Also by staying consistent with Irridex theory, we find that tourism at low levels of development contributes more to happiness than tourism at a high level of development.",
Bias reduction of peer influence effects with latent coordinates and community membership,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA),2017,2017,"The importance of peer influence on consumer actions plays a vital role in marketing efforts. However, peer influence effects are often confounded with latent homophily, which are unobserved commonalities that drive friendship. Understanding causality has become one of the pressing issues of current research. We present an approach to explicitly account for various causal influences. We implement a simulation framework to show the effectiveness of two latent homophily proxies, latent coordinates and community membership, in improving peer influence effect estimates on game downloads in a Japanese social network website. We demonstrate that latent homophily proxies have no significant improvement in peer influence effect bias in the available website data.",
"Platform Structures, Homing Preferences, and Homophilous Propensities in Online Social Networks",JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2017,2017,"This study investigates how the attributes of online social platforms (e.g., open vs. closed, symmetric vs. asymmetric social networks) and user preferences regarding platform diversity (e.g., single-homing vs. multi-homing) moderate the influence of homophily on user behaviors across varied social segments. On the basis of panel data, we delve into the interplay among homophily, structural diversities across various online social networking services (SNSs), and users' homing preferences in such social platforms. The data feature of the SNS consumption behaviors of 10,172 individual users are obtained over a period of 134 days. An agent-based simulation model is developed to further validate and generalize the empirical findings. The simulation and empirical results consistently indicate that propensity toward homophily differs significantly across platform types and users' channel adoption behaviors. Online homophily is more pronounced in closed, private social networks than in open, public social networks. Users of asymmetric and symmetric SNSs exhibit weak and strong homophily, respectively. Moreover, whereas users who adopt a single SNS channel tend toward homophily, those who subscribe to multiple SNSs confirm the idea that ""opposites attract."" These findings suggest that users of online SNS channels manifest complex human interactions typified by the combination of homophily, heterophily, and asymmetric social preference, although homophily is the most prominent disposition. Our findings suggest that homophily should be considered a dynamically changing human characteristic rather than a static attribute, and stakeholders should exploit the complex nature of users' homophilous behaviors to address social problems in online SNSs and to enhance the effectiveness of social advertising.",
Community Detection in Social Network with Node Attributes based on Formal Concept Analysis,2017 IEEE/ACS 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (AICCSA),2017,2017,"As far as social networks are concerned, new applications appear to analyze them. Community detection is one of the most important issues. It allows to understand the structure of complex networks and to extract useful information from the detected communities. Users have usually a social interaction with their friends because of their common interests or their similar profiles. In this paper, attributed graphs are considered, where entities of the network are described using attributes with several modalities. Then, we propose an hybrid approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) for community detection in social network with node attributes. This method, called ACDC (Attributed Community Detection based on Concepts), combines the structure of the network and the attributes of the nodes. ACDC, semantically and statically, partitions an assigned graph into k densely connected communities, using maximal cliques, with homogeneous attribute values derived from FCA. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACDC through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and methods. Our method provides also more meaningful communities than conventional methods that consider only relationship information.",
The Dynamics of Health Sentiments with Competitive Interactions in Social Media,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS (ISI),2017,2017,"Public sentiments affecting health outcomes are increasingly modulated by social media. Existing literature mainly focus on investigating how network structure affects the contagion of health sentiments. However, most of these studies neglect that the interaction topology change in time. In fact, the change of inter-individual connections over time is associated with individual attributes. The mechanism through which individual attributes reshapes the connection topology is mainly governed by the competition between two principles, i.e., homophily (establishing or reinforcing social connections) and homeostasis (preserving the total strength of social connections to each individual). No existing approaches are yet able to accommodate these two competing effects at the same time.We thus propose a new statistical model (H2 model, Homophily and Homestasis model) to depict the evolution of temporal network, which is governed by the competition of homophily and homeostasis. In addition, we consider the mediation effect of external shock events, which enables us to separate exogenous confounding factors. Evaluation on Twitter data suggests that H2 model can capture long-range sentiment dynamics and external shock events. In sentiment prediction, H2 consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of error rate. Through the model's shock tensor, we successfully detect several typical events, and reveal that users in negative emotions are more influenced by external shock events than those with positive emotions. Our findings have practical significance for those who supervise and guide health sentiments in online communities.",
Improving Individual Predictions using Social Networks Assortativity,"2017 12TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS AND LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION, CLUSTERING AND DATA VISUALIZATION (WSOM)",2017,2017,"Social networks are known to be assortative with respect to many attributes, such as age, weight, wealth, level of education, ethnicity and gender. This can be explained by influences and homophilies. Independently of its origin, this assortativity gives us information about each node given its neighbors. Assortativity can thus be used to improve individual predictions in a broad range of situations, when data are missing or inaccurate. This paper presents a general framework based on probabilistic graphical models to exploit social network structures for improving individual predictions of node attributes. Using this framework, we quantify the assortativity range leading to an accuracy gain in several situations. We finally show how specific characteristics of the network can improve performances further. For instance, the gender assortativity in real-world mobile phone data changes significantly according to some communication attributes. In this case, individual predictions with 75% accuracy are improved by up to 3%.",
Social Commerce and Herd Behaviour An Examination of the Moderating Roles of Age and Homophily,2017 12TH IBERIAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES (CISTI),2017,2017,Herd behaviour has been demonstrated to influence the online actions of individuals. This work-in-progress-paper proposes a research model to examine the role of age and homophily in the perpetuation of herding within the context of online shopping. An experimental-based methodology is outlined to empirically validate the proposed model using structural equation modeling techniques. Potential contributions to theory and practice are also discussed.,
Target Distribution Guided Network Sampling,2017 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED CLOUD AND BIG DATA (CBD),2017,2017,"Studying public users' data on social networks to provide service and prediction for the society has been a widespread and effective way thanks to the rapid raise of social networks. However, users' population structure online is usually different from that of physical world, which may influence the researches significantly. Thus it may become an essential limitation for studies conducted by revealing knowledge from social media data owing to the biased network population structure. Tradition sample approaches are either resources-intensive or data-biased. In this paper, we proposed a target distribution guided sample process to solve the problem of imbalanced user data in the virtual space. We make intervention to the sampling procedure according to the real-time divergence of the collected sample set against the target distribution, apply theory of homophily to discover the users with matched features and refine the samples with recursive sampling. Experiments show this method is able to successfully constrain samples' overall structure according to the given distribution within a given JS divergence of 0.1 while leaving the unrelated features distributed randomly. Moreover, it takes less times of access to collect a certain number of samples for the method proposed in this paper and thus save time and computer resources.",
Population Distribution Projection by Modeling Geo Homophily in Online Social Networks,PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CROWD SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ICCSE 2017,2017,2017,"Today, many applications depend on the projection on the population distribution in geographical regions, such as launching marketing campaigns and enhancing the public safety in certain densely-populated areas. Demographic and sociological researches have provided various ways of collecting people's trajectory data through oline means. However, collecting oline data consumes a lot of resources, and the data availability is usually limited. Fortunately, the wide spread of online social network (OSN) applications over mobile devices relect many geographical information, where we could devise a light weight approach of conducting the study on the projection of the population distribution using the online data. In this paper, we propose a geo-homophily model in OSNs to help project the population distribution in a given division of geographical regions. We establish a three-layer theoretic framework: It first describes the relationship between the online message difusion among friends in the OSN and the oline population distribution over a given division of regions via a Dirichlet process, and then projects the loating population across the regions. Evaluations over large-scale OSN datasets show that the proposed prediction models can characterize the process of the formation of the population distribution and the changes of the loating population over time with a high prediction accuracy.",
Community Detection On Citation Network Of DBLP Data Sample Set Using LinkRank Algorithm,4TH INFORMATION SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE (ISICO 2017),2017,2017,"This paper describes the application of a community detection algorithm, namely LinkRank algorithm, on a citation network. Community detection is a task in network analysis which aims to find sets of tightly connected nodes that are loosely connected with other nodes outside of those sets. In our study, we focused on a citation network which depicts relationships between cited papers and the papers which cite those papers. The objectives of our study are to identify communities of papers based on the citation relationships and analyze the similarities of topics within each community. The approach of our study to reach the objectives is by applying LinkRank algorithm to a citation network. LinkRank algorithm is chosen because it can be applied to a directed network where other algorithms that we have surveyed can only be used on undirected network. The citation network that we used in our study is from Aminer website. In applying the algorithm, we had to port the original source code which is written in C programming language into Python programming language for our convenience in doing the experiment. The result shows that the algorithm able to detect 10,442 communities from 188,514 nodes. Once the communities have been detected, we sampled top three communities (the ones with the largest number of members) and took the top 10 nodes with the highest PageRank score in each of those communities. The samples show that most of the nodes have similar topic, but there are still some nodes with different topics mixed inside the same community. We found the ratio between nodes with similar and different topics to be 7 to 3, that is 70% of the nodes have similar topic while the other 30% have different topics. Thus, the homophily of each community does not reach 100%. Nevertheless, our study confirms that LinkRank algorithm can be used for community detection on directed network. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Network analysis of SME's innovation activities : the forgotten role of homophily,REVUE INTERNATIONALE PME,2017,2017,"Innovation studies in SMEs has been interested for long time by the place and role of networks. In these studies, everything happens as if all the relations were possible and also likely. Yet, nothing is more inaccurate : all the relations do not have the same probability to exist and networks are also structured and hierarchical. In networks analysis, this classic observation sends back to the principle of homophily; principle according to which people or organizations tend to form connections with others who are similar to them in social or organizational characteristics. From an exploratory research based on interviews with entrepreneurs and managers of firms working in the industry of clean technologies, we will see how the principle of homophily turns out to be necessary in the understanding of, on one hand, the existence of the relations observed in the innovation's activities of SMEs, and on the other, their capacity to give access to the resources which the SMEs need in their innovation's projects.",
Random Walk based Co-occurrence Prediction in Location-Based Social Networks,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC),2017,2017,"In this paper, we propose a new version of the LBRW (Learning based Random Walk), LBRW-Co, for predicting users co-occurrence based on mobility homophily and social links. More precisely, we analyze and mine jointly spatio-temporal and social features with the aim to predict and rank users co-occurrences. Experiments are performed on the Foursquare LBSN with accurate and refined measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that our LBRW-Co model have substantial advantages over baseline approaches in predicting and ranking co-occurrence interactions.",
Random Walk based Fake Account Detection in Online Social Networks,2017 47TH ANNUAL IEEE/IFIP INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS (DSN),2017,2017,"Online social networks are known to be vulnerable to the so-called Sybil attack, in which an attacker maintains massive fake accounts (also called Sybils) and uses them to perform various malicious activities. Therefore, Sybil detection is a fundamental security research problem in online social networks. Random walk based methods, which leverage the structure of an online social network to distribute reputation scores for users, have been demonstrated to be promising in certain real-world online social networks. In particular, random walk based methods have three desired features: they can have theoretically guaranteed performance for online social networks that have the fast-mixing property, they are accurate when the social network has strong homophily property, and they can be scalable to large-scale online social networks. However, existing random walk based methods suffer from several key limitations: 1) they can only leverage either labeled benign users or labeled Sybils, but not both, 2) they have limited detection accuracy for weak-homophily social networks, and 3) they are not robust to label noise in the training dataset.In this work, we propose a new random walk based Sybil detection method called SybilWalk. SybilWalk addresses the limitations of existing random walk based methods while maintaining their desired features. We perform both theoretical and empirical evaluations to compare SybilWalk with previous random walk based methods. Theoretically, for online social networks with the fast-mixing property, SybilWalk has a tighter asymptotical bound on the number of Sybils that are falsely accepted into the social network than all existing random walk based methods. Empirically, we compare SybilWalk with previous random walk based methods using both social networks with synthesized Sybils and a large-scale Twitter dataset with real Sybils. Our empirical results demonstrate that 1) SybilWalk is substantially more accurate than existing random walk based methods for weak-homophily social networks, 2) SybilWalk is substantially more robust to label noise than existing random walk based methods, and 3) SybilWalk is as scalable as the most efficient existing random walk based methods. In particular, on the Twitter dataset, SybilWalk achieves a false positive rate of 1.3% and a false negative rate of 17.3%.",
Disentangled Link Prediction for Signed Social Networks via Disentangled Representation Learning,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS (DSAA),2017,2017,"Link prediction is an important and interesting application for social networks because it can infer potential links among network participants. Existing approaches basically work with the homophily principle, i.e., people of similar characteristics tend to befriend each other. In this way, however, they are not suitable for inferring negative links or hostile links, which usually take place among people with different characteristics. Moreover, negative links tend to couple with positive links to form signed networks. In this paper, we thus study the problem of disentangled link prediction (DLP) for signed networks, which includes two separate tasks, i.e., inferring positive links and inferring negative links. Recently, representation learning methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction problem because the entire network structure can be encoded in representations. For the DLP problem, we thus propose to disentangle a node representation into two representations, and use one for positive link prediction and another for negative link prediction. Experiments on three real-world signed networks demonstrate the proposed disentangled representation learning (DRL) method significantly outperforms alternatives in the DLP problem.",
A study of stochastic mixed membership models for link prediction in social networks,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS (DSAA),2017,2017,"We assess here whether standard stochastic mixed membership models are adapted for link prediction in social networks by studying how they handle homophily and preferential attachment. According to the homophily hypothesis, two vertices are more likely to be connected if they share common characteristics whereas preferential attachment states that a vertex prefers to join the more connected nodes existing in the network. To study these properties, we first introduce formal definitions of these phenomena; we then study how stochastic mixed membership models relate to these definitions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that standard stochastic mixed membership models comply with homophily with the similarity that underlies them. For preferential attachment, the situation is more contrasted: if these models do not comply with global preferential attachment, their compliance to local preferential attachment depends on whether the memberships to latent factors are hard or soft, and in the latter case on whether the underlying latent factor distribution is bursty or not. We illustrate these elements on synthetic and real networks by using the generative properties of Bayesian model.",
Dynamics of Group Cohesion in Homophilic Networks,2017 IEEE 56TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC),2017,2017,Understanding cohesion and homophily in empirical networks allows us build better personalization and recommendation systems. This paper proposes a network model that explains the emergence of cohesion and homophily as an aggregate outcome at the group-and network-level. We introduce two simple mechanisms that capture the underlying tendencies of nodes to connect with similar and different others. Our main theoretical result presents conditions on the network under which it reaches high degrees of cohesion and homophily.,
"Effects of Male High School Students' Friend Subgroups, Social Achievement Goal, Learning Types, and Academic Achievement on Academic Help Networks",The Educational Research for Tomorrow,2017,2017,"The purpose of this study was to identify subgroups in friends networks among male high school students and to investigate the effects of friend subgroups, social achievement goal, learning types, and academic achievement on academic help networks using social network analysis. Frank(1995)'s method was used to identify friend subgroups and and * models for dyads and triads were used to investigate academic help networks. First, friends networks were classified into 4-5 subgroups consisting of 4-7 students. Second, for models, when the goal of social competence and the preference of auditory learning type were high and the goal of social performance approach was low, more academic help was provided. In addition, when the goal of social performance approach was high and the social performance avoidance and the preference of auditory learning type were low, the tendency to receive more academic help was shown. Third, the results of * models indicated that as academic achievement was increased, more academic help was provided and the low social performance avoidance had the tendency to receive more academic help. In summary, when the academic achievement was similar and the affiliation of friends network subgroup was the same, the probability of giving and receiving academic help was higher. Therefore, we inferred that the homophily effects of academic achievement and friends subgroups were found in academic help networks among male high school students.",
Core Ties Homophily and Sociocultural Divides in Hungary from 1987 to 2015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2017,2017,"In this article, we focus on the changes of network structures in Hungary, making use of a series of surveys covering a period of nearly 30 years from 1987 to 2015. Using the name-generator network technique, our main focus is on patterns of homophily and social distance with regard to some sociodemographic and resource-type variables. Two methods have been applied: a standard methodology based on crosstab analysis and a more complex approach based on a special case-control procedure. Contrary to some expectations, our results indicate a tendency of robust homophily and its consolidation over the examined period. Associations by age and education present quite stable patterns with a high, even somewhat growing, level of homophily. The analyses covering several decades suggest that stability and change are both present with lasting, and in certain respects increasing, intergroup distances with regard to the core tie traits of social life in Hungary.",
Modelling and analysis of the dynamics of adaptive temporal-causal network models for evolving social interactions.,Computational social networks,2017,2017,"Background: Network-Oriented Modelling based on adaptive temporal-causal networks provides a unified approach to model and analyse dynamics and adaptivity of various processes, including mental and social interaction processes.Methods: Adaptive temporal-causal network models are based on causal relations by which the states in the network change over time, and these causal relations are adaptive in the sense that they themselves also change over time.Results: It is discussed how modelling and analysis of the dynamics of the behaviour of these adaptive network models can be performed. The approach is illustrated for adaptive network models describing social interaction.Conclusions: In particular, the homophily principle and the 'more becomes more' principles for social interactions are addressed. It is shown how the chosen Network-Oriented Modelling method provides a basis to model and analyse these social phenomena.",
NETWORK DISCOVERY USING CONTENT AND HOMOPHILY,"2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)",2017,2017,"A new approach for targeted graph sampling is proposed in which graph sampling and classification occur together, and content-based homophily is exploited to achieve improved classification performance. The application of network discovery of relevant content is considered using an approach that may be generalized to a broad class of vertex properties. The resulting procedure provides the initial step of a graph analytic processing chain whose performance is directly affected by the quality of graph sampling. The performance of the algorithm is measured with real network data and content observed on a social media site. Precision-Recall performance improvements of 30% are demonstrated with this dataset, compared to a baseline approach that does not exploit homophily. Because real-world graphs grow exponentially, this performance improvement may have a significant impact on graph analytic algorithms with sensitivities to the graph sampling quality.",
A network of helping: generalized reciprocity and cooperative behavior in response to peer and staff affirmations and corrections among therapeutic community residents,ADDICTION RESEARCH & THEORY,2017,2017,"Background: Clinical theory in therapeutic communities (TCs) for substance abuse treatment emphasizes the importance of peer interactions in bringing about change. This implies that residents will respond in a more prosocial manner to peer versus staff intervention and that residents will interact in such a way as to maintain cooperation.Method: The data consist of electronic records of peer and staff affirmations and corrections at four corrections-based TC units. We treat the data as a directed social network of affirmations. We sampled 100 resident days from each unit (n = 400) and used a generalized linear mixed effects network time series model to analyze the predictors of sending and receiving affirmations and corrections. The model allowed us to control for characteristics of individuals as well as network-related dependencies.Results: Residents show generalized reciprocity following peer affirmations, but not following staff affirmations. Residents did not respond to peer corrections by increasing affirmations, but responded to staff corrections by decreasing affirmations. Residents directly reciprocated peer affirmations. Residents were more likely to affirm a peer whom they had recently corrected. Residents were homophilous with respect to race, age and program entry time.Conclusion: This analysis demonstrates that TC residents react more prosocially to behavioral intervention by peers than by staff. Further, the community exhibits generalized and direct reciprocity, mechanisms known to foster cooperation in groups. Multiple forms of homophily influence resident interactions. These findings validate TC clinical theory while suggesting paths to improved outcomes.",
Understanding the Public's Intentions to Purchase and to Persuade Others to Purchase Antibiotic-Free Meat,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2017,2017,"Extending the effectiveness of media-based campaigns into interpersonal networks has been a long concern for studies on persuasive messages, yet there is much to understand about why people attempt to persuade others to engage in health-related behaviors. This study investigated two alternative predictors of interpersonal persuasion: psychosocial determinants of behavior and homophily. We used the integrated model of behavior (IMB) to predict consumers' intentions to purchase antibiotic-free meat, and extended the model to predict consumers' intentions to encourage important others to do so. IMB variables predicted 44% of future purchasing intentions and 40% of future persuasion intentions. The findings support a homophily explanation for persuasion: people intend to persuade important others to do what they do. In addition, a person-centered analysis identified three audience segments based on antibiotic-resistance-related behaviors, cognitions, and experiences: Purchasers, Resisters, and New Adopters. The covariate analysis revealed that people who had more topic awareness of antibiotic use in animal husbandry, knowledge of someone with an antibiotic-resistant infection, and health mavenism were more likely to be Purchasers than Resisters or New Adopters. Anxiety, however, was highest among New Adopters and lowest among Resisters. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",

The role of social conformity in rumor transmission,Broadcasting & Communacation,2017,2017,"The purpose of this study is to investigate how rumor is diffused in the online networks by examining the effect of social conformity on rumor belief and rumor transmission. An online survey was conducted to investigate the effect of perceived homophily and intimacy on social conformity, and the relations among social conformity, perceived rumor belief and sharing of the rumor. The results showed that while perceived homophily had a positive impact on social conformity, emotional intimacy did not influence social conformity. When people conformed to the community members who thought the rumor is credible, they were willing to follow others’ attitude towards the rumor and transmit the rumor to other groups. Overall, the results reveal that social conformity is an important factor that explains why people spread rumors even when they doubt the rumor’s credibility.",
Identifying the factors that influence eWOM in SNSs: the case of Chile,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING,2017,2017,"The factors that influence electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites (SNSs) in Latin American countries still need to be understood. This paper looks at factors included by prior research, as well as two new factors that have the power to influence eWOM in SNSs in the region. The study is conducted in Chile, a country which already has high Internet and SNSs penetration rates and Hofstede's scores close to the average for Latin America. The results show that tie strength, normative influence, informational influence, self-presentation, and voluntary self-disclosure are all positively directly associated with eWOM in SNSs. The results also show that homophily exerts a positive indirect influence on eWOM through the mediators of tie strength, normative influence, informational influence, and self-presentation. Additionally, the results show that trust exerts a positive indirect influence on eWOM through the mediators of tie strength, normative influence, and voluntary self-disclosure.",
From susceptibility to frailty in social networks: The case of obesity,MATHEMATICAL POPULATION STUDIES,2017,2017,"The obesity pandemic is represented by a discrete-time Hopfield Boolean network embedded in continuous-time population dynamics. The influence of the social environment passes through a system of differential equations, whereby obesity spreads by imitation of the most influential neighbors, those who have the highest centrality indices in the network. This property is called homophily. Susceptibility and frailty are redefined using network properties. Projections of the spread of obesity are validated on data collected in a French high school.",
The Transformative Power of Authentic Conversations About Cancer,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2017,2017,"Entertainment-education (E-E) assumes that actors performing content should be ethnically and culturally homogeneous with targeted audiences. The present study challenges this basic E-E assumption. Findings are presented from audience members who viewed When Cancer Calls.... This theatrical production was constructed from verbatim transcriptions of naturally occurring telephone conversations between White family members as they communicated about and through their cancer journey. Non-White audience members were significantly more likely than White audience members to (a) regard the performance as authentic, (b) find it would influence ""people like me,"" and (c) recommend the production to others. These findings suggest that all people must rely on communication when facing health challenges together. Such interactions that are fundamental to family membership are thus primal for the human social condition, regardless of differences in race and ethnicity. These findings also suggest innovative approaches to E-E health interventions that may contradict traditional market segmentation theories based on cultural differences and the principle of homophily.",

Network Formation During Disasters: Exploring Micro-Level Interorganizational Processes and the Role of National Capacity,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,2017,2017,"Despite common assumptions about the processes associated with interorganizational network formation, the resulting structures and relevant factors often vary. This variation suggests that there are likely contextual or meta-network variables that moderate the influence of well-established micro-level mechanisms. Because much of the existing research on disaster response networks relies on single case studies, the role of meta-network variables in shaping network formation remains unexplored. We look to fill this gap by comparing network formation patterns in multiple countries that vary in their disaster management capacity. This article uses social network analysis to analyze the formation of response networks after earthquakes in Indonesia, Haiti, and Japan. This study contributes to existing literature by examining how transitivity, homophily, and brokerage vary in their salience under different macro-level constraints. The results suggest that national response capacity may influence the jurisdictional level at which bridging and bonding strategies take place.",
Determinants of Brand Recall in Social Networking Sites,STRATEGIC USES OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR IMPROVED CUSTOMER RETENTION,2017,2017,"This research aims to contribute to the understanding of how brand impressions in social networking sites influence brand recall. Further, the relationship between the built-in metrics offered by social networking sites and brand recall are also examined to assess the validity of these metrics as measures of advertising effectiveness. Results indicate a positive relationship between brand recall and self-brand congruence, tie-strength with, trust toward, and perceived popularity of the profile associated with the post, and clicking a link embedded in the post / ad in which the brand appears. On the other hand, there is not a significant difference between the levels of brand involvement, homophily with the profile associated with the post / ad, like-count, and four types of built-in user-interaction options including liking, sharing, posting a comment and tagging among the brands that were successfully retrieved from the memory and those were not.",

Hence, this chapter addresses concepts such as components and isolates, cores and periphery, network density, shortest paths, reciprocity, affiliation networks and two-mode networks, and homophily.",
Inferring and analysis of social networks using RFID check-in data in China,Figshare,2017-09-14,2017,"Social networks play an important role in our daily lives. However, social ties are rather elusive to quantify, especially for large groups of subjects over prolonged periods of time. In this work, we first propose a methodology for extracting social ties from long spatio-temporal data streams, where the subjects are 17,795 undergraduates from a university of China and the data streams are the 9,147,106 time-stamped RFID check-in records left behind by them during one academic year. By several metrics mentioned below, we then analyze the structure of the social network. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the network, and we confirm the small-world phenomenon on a global scale. Second, we find that the network shows clear community structure. And we observe that younger students at lower levels tend to form large communities, while students at higher levels mostly form smaller communities. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity on a global scale. Furthermore, we find a strong effect of grade and school on tie formation preference, but we do not find any strong region homophily. Our research may help us to elucidate the structural characteristics and the preference of the formation of social ties in college students social network. Copyright: CC BY 4.0",
Formation of homophily in academic performance: Students change their friends rather than performance,Figshare,2017-09-14,2017,"Homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with others who share similar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in the formation and evolution of social ties. In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is the result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their performance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and networks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical educational settings could have important implications for the understanding of the observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in societies.

FOSTERING THE REDUCTION OF ASSORTATIVE MIXING OR HOMOPHILY INTO THE CLASS,"INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE",2017,2017,"Human societies from the outset have been associated according to race, beliefs, religion, social level, and the like. These behaviors continue even today in the classroom at primary, middle, and superior levels. However, the growth of ICT offers educational researchers new ways to explore methods of team formation that have been proven to be efficient in the field of serious games through the use of computer networks. The selection process of team members in serious games with the use of computer networks is carried out according to their performance in the area of the game without distinction of social variables.The use of serious games in education has been discussed in multiple research studies, which state that its application in teaching and learning processes are changing the way of teaching. This article presents an exploratory analysis of the team formation process based on collaboration with ICT tools of collective intelligence labelled The best team (TBT). The process and its ICT tool combine the paradigms of creativity in swarming, collective intelligence, serious games, and social computing in order to capture the participants' emotions and evaluate contributions.Based on the results, we consider that the use of new forms of teaching and learning based on the emerging paradigms is necessary. Therefore, TBT is a tool that could become an effective way to encourage the formation of work groups by evaluating objective variable of performance of its members in collaborative works.",
Science 'fact' and science 'fiction'? Homophilous communication in high-technology B2B selling,JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT,2017,2017,"This study deepens our understanding of the processes underpinning the diffusion of innovation by critically exploring the language that scientist sellers and buyers employ to facilitate sensemaking in their spoken marketing communications. Pervasive complex technical terminology within business-to-business (B2B) high-technology sales relationships results in numerous sensemaking challenges. Using a discourse analytic methodology, sellers and buyers from nanotechnology companies are interviewed to better understand how culturally close (homophilous) or culturally distant (heterophilous) sales talk influences sensemaking. Although a need for 'marketing' is begrudgingly acknowledged, these boundary spanners all appear to enact centralised identities as 'scientists' engaged in selling and buying. Working towards maintaining homophily, participants claim to jointly use linguistic tools such as metaphors and popular cultural references to enable a functional level of sensegiving and making.",
Why Amicus Curiae Cosigners Come and Go: A Dynamic Model of Interest Group Networks,COMPLEX NETWORKS & THEIR APPLICATIONS V,2017,2017,"Interest groups use coalition strategies to exert influence, yet, like other political actors, they also withdraw from partnerships in the pursuit of other policy goals. We explore how interest group coalition strategies have changed over time and which factors determine whether interest groups relationships form and dissolve. Utilizing dynamic networks of a panel of interest groups derived from cosigner status to United States Supreme Court amicus curiae briefs, we illuminate the evolution of the social networks of frequent signers from the 1970s to the present day. A separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) shows that the number of partners is important for formation but not dissolution, while industrial homophily helps both to make and maintain connections. In addition, statistical trends suggest that while networks change, a few players have acted continuously as coordination hubs for the bulk of the decades. However, a number of other key players in particular decades would be missed without a dynamic perspective.",
Information Diffusion in Heterogeneous Groups,COMPLEX NETWORKS & THEIR APPLICATIONS V,2017,2017,"Standard approaches to the study of information diffusion draw on analogies to the transmission of diseases or computer viruses, and find that adding more random ties to a network increases the speed of information propagation through it. However, a person sharing information in a social network differs from a computer transmitting a virus in two important respects: a person may not have the opportunity to pass the information to every tie, and may be unwilling to pass the information to certain ties even when presented with the opportunity. Accounting for these two features reveals that, while additional random ties allow information to jump to distant regions of a network, they also change the composition of network neighborhoods. When the latter increases the proportion of neighbors to whom people are less willing to pass information, the result can be a net decrease in diffusion. I show that this is the case in heterogeneous, homophilous networks: the addition of random ties strictly impedes information dissemination, and the impediment is increasing in both original homophily and the number of new ties.",
Social Connection Dynamics in a Health Promotion Network,COMPLEX NETWORKS & THEIR APPLICATIONS V,2017,2017,"The influence of social connections on human behaviour has been demonstrated in many occasions. This paper presents the analysis of the dynamic properties of longitudinal (335 days) community data (n=3,375 participants) from an online health promotion program. The community data is unique as it describes how the network has evolved since its inception and because the information exchanged through the network was predominantly about the achievements of participants in the program and therefore influencing behavior through social comparison. The analyses show that the largest component of the community network has characteristics of a small world network. The analyses also show that connections are formed according to a strong attachment preference according to the gender, and a weaker homophily for Body Mass Index. The presented analysis can serve as basis for creating novel interventions that influence physical activity behavior through social connections.",
Social Differentiation in Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that Engage in Human-Related Foraging Behaviors,Figshare,2017-09-14,2017,"Both natural and human-related foraging strategies by the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) have resulted in social segregation in several areas of the world. Bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia beg at an unprecedented rate and also forage behind commercial shrimp trawlers, providing an opportunity to study the social ramifications of two human-related foraging behaviors within the same group of animals. Dolphins were photo-identified via surveys conducted throughout estuarine waterways around Savannah in the summers of 2009-2011. Mean half-weight indices (HWI) were calculated for each foraging class, and community division by modularity was used to cluster animals based on association indices. Pairs of trawler dolphins had a higher mean HWI (0.20 0.07) than pairs of non-trawler dolphins (0.04 0.02) or mixed pairs (0.02 0.02). In contrast, pairs of beggars, non-beggars, and mixed pairs all had similar means, with HWI between 0.05-0.07. Community division by modularity produced a useful division (0.307) with 6 clusters. Clusters were predominately divided according to trawler status; however, beggars and non-beggars were mixed throughout clusters. Both the mean HWI and social clusters revealed that the social structure of common bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia was differentiated based on trawler status but not beg status. This finding may indicate that foraging in association with trawlers is a socially learned behavior, while the mechanisms for the propagation of begging are less clear. This study highlights the importance of taking into account the social parameters of a foraging behavior, such as how group size or competition for resources may affect how the behavior spreads. The positive or negative ramifications of homophily may influence whether the behaviors are exhibited by individuals within the same social clusters and should be considered in future studies examining social relationships and foraging behaviors.

Information-Sharing Patterns of A Directed Social Network: The Case of Imhonet,Journal of Internet Computing and Services,2017,2017,"Despite various types of online social networks having different topological and functional characteristics, the kinds of online social networks considered in social recommendations are highly restricted. The pervasiveness of social networks has brought scholarly attention to expanding the scope of social recommendations into more diverse and less explored types of online social networks. As a preliminary attempt, this study examined the information-sharing patterns of a new type of online social network – unilateral (directed) network – and assessed the feasibility of the network as a useful information source. Specifically, this study mainly focused on the presence of shared interests in unilateral networks, because the shared information is the inevitable condition for utilizing the networks as a feasible source of personalized recommendations. As the results, we discovered that user pairs with direct and distant links shared significantly more similar information than the other non-connected pairs. Individual users’ social properties were also significantly correlated with the degree of their information similarity with social connections. We also found the substitutability of online social networks for the top cohorts anonymously chosen by the collaborative filtering algorithm.",
An exploratory comparison of name generator content: Data from rural India,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2017,2017,"Since the 1970s sociologists have explored the best means for measuring social networks, although few name generator analyses have used sociocentric data or data from developing countries, partly because sociocentric studies in developing countries have been scant. Here, we analyze 12 different name generators used in a sociocentric network study conducted in 75 villages in rural Karnataka, India. Having unusual sociocentric data from a non-Western context allowed us to extend previous name generator research through the unique analyses of network structural measures, an extensive consideration of homophily, and investigation of status difference between egos and alters. We found that domestic interaction questions generated networks that were highly clustered and highly centralized. Similarity between respondents and their nominated contacts was strongest for gender, caste, and religion. We also found that domestic interaction name generators yielded the most homogeneous ties, while advice questions yielded the most heterogeneous. Participants were generally more likely to nominate those of higher social status, although certain questions, such as who participants talk to uncovered more egalitarian relationships, while other name generators elicited the names of social contacts distinctly higher or lower in status than the respondent. Some questions also seemed to uncover networks that were specific to the cultural context, suggesting that network researchers should balance local relevance with global generalizability when choosing name generators.

Homophily Evolution in Online Networks: Who Is a Good Friend and When?,"ANALYSIS OF IMAGES, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND TEXTS, AIST 2016",2017,2017,"Homophily is considered by network scientists as one of the major mechanisms of social network formation. However, the role of dynamic homophily in the network growth process has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, we estimate the role of homophily by various attributes at different stages of online network formation process. We consider the process of online friendship formation in the Vkontakte social networking site among first-year students at a Russian university. We reveal that at the beginning of the network formation a similarity in gender and score in entrance exams plays the key role, while by the end of network establishment period the role of the same group affiliation becomes more important. We explain the results with the tendency of students to follow different strategies to control the information flow in their social environment.",
Behavior-Base Collective Classification in Sparsely Labeled Networks,IEEE ACCESS,2017,2017,"Classification in sparsely labeled networks is challenging to traditional neighborhood-based methods due to the lack of labeled neighbors. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-based collective classification (BCC) method to improve the classification performance in sparsely labeled networks. In BCC, nodes' behavior features are extracted and used to build latent relationships between labeled nodes and unknown ones. Since mining the latent links does not rely on the direct connection of nodes, decrease of labeled neighbors will have minor effect on classification results. In addition, the BCC method can also be applied to the analysis of networks with heterophily as the homophily assumption is no longer required. Experiments on various public data sets reveal that the proposed method can obtain competing performance in comparison with the other state-of-the-art methods either when the network is labeled sparsely or when homophily is low in the network.",
Bonding and bridging among first generation Asian migrants in Australian protestant churches,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,2017,2017,"Around a third of Asian migrants to Australia self-identify as Christians, and many join churches where they meet fellow migrants and other Australians. Churches might thus be places that can foster the integration of Asian migrants into Australian society. This paper uses social network and social capital theory to examine the prevalence of bonding and bridging among 61,386 churchgoers from 2135 Protestant churches who completed the Australian National Church Life Survey in 2011. We compared levels of bonding and bridging social ties of first-generation Asian migrants (FGAM) with Australians born of Australian-born parents (ABOAP). FGAM joining congregations had fewer social ties than ABOAP, and developed bridging (but not bonding) more slowly. FGAM had lower bonding but higher bridging in MonoAnglo congregations compared with Multicultural or MonoAsian congregations. The results suggest that FGAM who are in MonoAnglo churches may be less tightly bound to their congregation, but more likely to bridge beyond it, than are FGAM in multicultural or largely Asian congregations.",
Status and international alliance formation,MULTINATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW,2017,2017,"Purpose - Evidence suggests that ""single-market"" alliances are more likely to form between firms in similar socially determined status positions. However, in international alliances, firms come from different status interfaces and foreign partners may become status competitors. Hence, the preference for partners with similar socially derived status positions in their respective markets, or status homophily, is unclear in 'international' partner selections. This analysis aims to better understand this issue.Design/methodology/approach - This research explores status homophily in international alliance formation using a database of hand-collected tombstone announcements for US initial public offering syndicates involving Japanese securities firms from 1975 through 1984.Findings - Results suggest that firms are attracted to partners who occupy similar socially derived status positions in their own home markets. Additionally, high-status host-country firms may signal status differences within alliances to reduce status competition from high-status foreign partners.Originality/value - This research indicates that ""international"" alliance research needs to consider socially derived status positions. Additionally, academics and practitioners alike can benefit from the knowledge that status signaling within alliances can be a type of competitive behavior between cooperating firms.",
Requiem for Online Harassers: Identifying Racism from Political Tweets,2017 FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDEMOCRACY & EGOVERNMENT (ICEDEG),2017,2017,"During the last five years, the amount of users of online social networks has increased exponentially. With the growing of users, social problems also arise. Due to the nature of these platforms, specifically Twitter, users can express their ideas in the way they prefer no matter if it is racist or not. As the Twitter CEO says, one of the most difficult things for them is to detect and ban people who harass others. Researches have addressed this issue in recent years. However, it is needed a wider range of strategies to detect racist users and content. In this work, we collect tweets produced by the ego networks of the two former 2016 US Presidential Candidates: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, grouped in four datasets. After deleting spammers, we get 84,371 unique users labeled by using two different metrics: Sentiment Word Count and Racist Score. Both of them let us not only to identify users as racists, but also to detect the level of negativism by analyzing their most recent 200 tweets, increasing the effectiveness of the method. Using it, we find the most negative and racist user and the most positive and non-racist user from all datasets. Taking advantage of the topological properties of the ego networks we analyzed, we also verify that our results satisfy the sociologist theory of homophily; where the followers of each candidate represent their homophilous. For a nation as the United States of America, detecting online harassers might help to decrease racism and cyberbullying, social problems that affect their society. A world without online harassers is an utopia, but this is one step to achieve it.",
Morality Predicts Enjoyment But Not Appreciation of Morally Ambiguous Characters,MEDIA PSYCHOLOGY,2017,2017,"Understanding the role of morally ambiguous characters such as anti-heroes in entertainment experiences has become a central concern for media researchers. Some have argued that different character schemas or tropes may vary along specific moral domains, whereas others promote a linear progression of moral violation from hero to villain. This study presents the results of survey data (N = 294) examining the perceptions of established character tropes in terms of character morality, enjoyment, and appreciation responses. Popular perceptions of character tropes drawn from the website TV Tropes did not significantly differ in terms of which moral domains they upheld or violated, but demonstrated a linear progression of moral violation across five domains of morality. Perceptions of character tropes also did not differ significantly in associations with enjoyment, appreciation, or variables drawn from character identification literature such as self-expansion, wishful identification, or homophily. When examining media responses, however, self-expansion, wishful identification, and moral violation were all strongly related to enjoyment. Unlike enjoyment, appreciation was not related to moral violation. These results are discussed in terms of hedonic and eudaimonic responses to characters.",
"A Decade of Dynamics of Residential Location, Car Ownership, Activity, Travel and Land Use in the Seattle Metropolitan Region",PAPERS SELECTED FOR THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY,2017,2017,"Using data of attitudes in the Puget Sound region we first identify predispositions in favor of car use (car loving persons and households) and distinguish them from other predispositions favoring other modes (transit and carsharing lovers). Then we explore if like-minded people (homophily) live together and examine heterogeneity within their households. To do this we analyze attitudinal data using multilevel latent class clustering that allows identification of groups of persons and groups of households jointly. Our analysis identifies distinct groups of people with different attitudes towards modes and we do not find strong homophily in attitudes within households. The distinction of attitudes among persons transfers well to the household level giving us the opportunity to identify and test differences among the different attitudinal groups using longitudinal records. We then move to a longitudinal analysis using a small sample of households that participated in more than ten years of the Puget Sound panel survey to explore the sequence of their residential location characteristics, car ownership, and travel. We find in descriptive statistics and in a second application of multilevel cluster models that carpool and transit loyalty persists over time by a portion of car pool and transit lovers. We also find sustained use of cars by car loving households, sustained car use of a neutral in attitudes group, a group of younger households with positive attitudes towards carsharing and sustained car sharing over time, and a possibly disenfranchised older household group lacking access to opportunities. The inclusion in the analysis of the two residential location characteristics (evolution of density and diversity around the household residence) enabled a more complete analysis and a clearer description of household context for both attitudes and behavior.

"Optimizing the Presentation of Mental Health Information in Social Media: The Effects of Health Testimonials and Platform on Source Perceptions, Message Processing, and Health Outcomes",HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2017,2017,"Using social media for the purpose of disseminating mental health information is a critical area of scientific inquiry for health communication professionals. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the presence of a first-person testimonial in educational mental health information placed in Facebook and Twitter messages influenced college students' (N=257) source perceptions, information processing, cognitive elaboration, health information recall, beliefs, and behavioral intentions. Results show that exposure to social media messages that featured mental health information embedded with a testimonial predicted less source homophily and more critical thoughts about the social media source, less systematic message processing, and less cognitive elaboration. Health information recall was significantly impacted by both the social media platform and message content such that participants in the testimonial condition on Facebook were more likely to recall the health facts in those messages whereas participants who viewed the testimonial in Twitter were less likely to recall the facts in those tweets. Compared to those who read Facebook messages, participants who read Twitter messages reported higher levels of systematic message processing. These findings suggest that the integration of health testimonials into social media messages might inadvertently provoke psychological resistance to mental health information, thereby reducing the persuasive impact of those messages.",
Homophily of Older Adults Based on Amygdala Volume,New Physics: Sae Mulli,2017,2017,"People sharing similar characteristics are likely to be connected in social networks. The purpose of this study is to theoretically integrate homophily in social networks with neuroscience so that we can better understand complex human nature. In this study, homophily of older adults based on the amygdala volume was tested. Korean Social Health and Aging Project (KSHAP) data were analyzed to examine the hypothesis. Between 71 participants (43 of them female), 75 dyadic relationships were identified. The results show that two connected older adults’ amygdala volumes were marginally correlated (p = 0.06). The tendency is clearer for those who meet each other every day (p = 0.004) or those who talk to each other every day (p = 0.008). No significant association between two people’s amygdala was found when they did not interact so frequently. The results imply that homophily occurs based on neurological features, especially the amygdala volume.",

Over a 2-week period, we collected Twitter mentions of 3 top cable news shows (N = 49,568) posted while these shows were broadcast. Using social network analysis, we reconstructed the social network of second screeners (N = 27,811) and found that the network exhibits ideological homophily with few cross-camp interactions. Our findings strongly indicate the existence of echo chambers in the second screen realm, with more confined echo chambers identified in networks of Twitter followers in comparison to second screeners. The study provides one of the most comprehensive mappings of the second screening phenomenon during an election campaign to date.",
"News media, social media, and hyperlink networks: An examination of integrated media effects",INFORMATION SOCIETY,2017,2017,"Research typically focuses on one medium. But in today's digital media environment, people use and are influenced by their experience with multiple systems. Building on media ecology research, we introduce the notion of integrated media effects. We draw on resource dependence and homophily theories to analyze the mechanisms that connect media systems. To test the integrated media effects, we examine the relationships between news media visibility and social media visibility and hyperlinking patterns among 410 nongovernmental organization (NGO) websites in China. NGOs with greater news media visibility and more social media followers receive significantly more hyperlinks. Further, NGOs with a similar number of social media followers prefer to hyperlink to each other. The results suggest that both news media and social media systems are related to the configuration of hyperlink networks, providing support for the integrated media effects described. Implications for the study of hyperlink networks, online behaviors of organizations, and public relations are drawn from the results.",
Building a Relationship with a Computer Agent: Receiving Social Support and Feeling Homophily from an Empathetic Computer Agent,Korean Journal of Journalism & Communication Studies,2017,2017,"In HCI(Human Computer Interaction) research, there has been a growing interest interacting with computer agents not merely as a functional machine, but as a relational parter. Considering that empathy plays an important role in relationship building between humans, this research aimed to investigate whether computer’s expression of empathy towards user increases perceived similarity, likability, and social support. In addition, as previous research under the CASA(Computer As Social Actors) paradigm shows inconsistent results, this research directly compared the effects of empathy between CMC(Computer mediated communication) and HCI conditions to see if there is any significant differences. To create a natural circumstance that empathetic communication takes place, we recruited 208 job seeking students and conducted a 2 × 2(Computer vs. Human × Empathy vs. Non-empathy) experiment, where cheering messages were delivered to the participating students. Results showed that computer’s empathy positively influenced on likability and emotional support, but not on perceived similarity and informational support, which was higher in non-empathy condition. Perceived similarity was higher when the message, whether it is empathetic or not, was delivered from human interactants. Implications on HCI design and CASA paradigm was discussed based on the study’s results.",
Core Discussion Networks of Korean Youths: A Comparative Analysis of 2002 and 2011,,2017,2017,"Discussion network consists of social ties to others with whom people talk over important matters in everyday life in times of trouble. With data from national surveys conducted in 2002 and 2011, the current study examines the composition and structure of core discussion networks of Korean adults aged 30s or younger and their determinants and then cluster-analyze the 2011 core discussion networks. First, family/kin members and schoolmates/alumni have been consistently the most significant others, with neighbors and acquaintances from various social activities less important over the last ten years. The core composition varies according to socio-demographic factors, but it has rarely changed over time. It is most seriously affected by marital status, and the relative importance of marital status and whether to have a job has become greater. Second, discussion networks are considerably closed with strong ties between ego and alters, with a marked tendency of homophily by sex, age, and education. The proportion of family/kin has had the highest leverage on network properties, followed by: sex on network density; marital status on the kin proportion and age heterophily; employment status on tie duration; and four-year university degree on network size, contact frequency, and educational heterophily. Lastly, the core discussion networks are distinguishable into a kin-centered cluster and three non-kin based ones. What type of personal community networks to belong to is significantly affected not only by sex and marital status and also by employment status, four-year university degree, subjective identification of social strata, and the perception of residential area. Overall, there will be likely in the near future growing diversification and stratification of psychological and social support networks of young Korean adults due to social and economic issues critical for them hard to be solved.",
"Consumers' self-congruence with a ""Liked"" brand Cognitive network influence and brand outcomes",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING,2017,2017,"Purpose - Brand ""Likes"" on Facebook facilitate self-expression, forming part of consumers' virtual selves. Yet, consumers' brand ""Likes"" may bear little resemblance to their material realities. This paper aims to test similarities of brand image with self-image for Facebook ""Likes"" to determine whether self-congruence with a ""Liked"" brand leads to positive offline brand outcomes. It also investigates whether consumers' perceptions about their Facebook social relations influence self-congruent brand ""Likes"".Design/methodology/approach - A large-scale survey was conducted of regular Facebook users who ""Liked"" brands. Data from 438 respondents was analysed and hypotheses tested using structural equation modeling.Findings - Empirical results show that the perceived self-congruence with a ""Liked"" brand increases with social tie strength. Perceived social tie strength is informed by perceived attitude homophily. When the perceived self-congruence with a ""Liked"" brand is higher, brand love and word of mouth (WOM) are enhanced. Consumers also have greater brand loyalty and offer more WOM when brands are loved.Research limitations/implications - Findings demonstrate the influence of consumers' cognitive network on ""Likes"" and brand outcomes. Further replication would enhance generalisability. Future research should use a wider sample and investigate other variables. Practical implications - Findings support managers seeking to grow and analyse Facebook ""Likes"" by providing insights into brand loyalty, brand love and WOM for ""Liked"" brands.Originality/value - The paper addresses the dearth of research exploring how consumers' perceptions of their Facebook network influence their online brand behaviour and how perceived self-congruence with a ""Liked"" brand relates to brand outcomes.",
Online public deliberation in China: evolution of interaction patterns and network homophily in the Tianya discussion forum,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,2017,2017,"Internet discussion platforms in China provide a hugely interesting and relevant source for understanding dynamics of online discussions in a unique context. Adopting the theoretical lens of public deliberation, this paper investigates the evolution of patterns of similar-minded and different-minded interactions over time on a Chinese online discussion forum. We analyse the content and reply networks of 18,000+ messages on four highly debated topics on the Bulletin Board System (BBS) platform Tianya. Findings provide nuanced evidence to the phenomenon of increased network homophily over time, mitigated in discussions where the difference between opinion sides is smaller, and participants have positive opinions. Providing empirical foundation for testing and refining the tenets of public deliberation in the unique sociocultural and institutional environment of China, this study lays ground for future investigation on independent variables for understanding dynamics of online discussions, and for studies comparing cases across different contexts.",
The Cascade Capacity Predicts Individuals to Seed for Diffusion Through Social Networks,SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE,JAN-FEB 2017,2017,"Why ideas and practices spread an important topic for management scholars and practitioners. This paper presents the cascade capacity as an aspect of network structure as a measure of essentially how 'choosy' everyone in a social network can be and still allow an individual to cause something to spread completely through the network. Drawing on social contagion theory and network theory, we propose a research model about how network structure relates to diffusion and test it by simulation, using network data from the popular microblogging service Twitter. Results show the cascade capacity is an important determinant of diffusion, even when we model for homophily. We show how the concept could be used to select individuals to seed to encourage word of mouth marketing. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
An approach to initiating eWOM intentions A study on the effects of reference price and value homophily,INTERNET RESEARCH,2017,2017,"Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects that reference prices and associated information sources (websites that consumers use to explore and their friends who have similar perspectives on value) have on deal evaluation and intention to disseminate electronic word of mouth (eWOM).Design/methodology/approach-A stratified survey is conducted to empirically test the relations between reference prices, associated information sources (the top five Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) websites and top five Facebook friends with similar perspectives and values on consumption), deal evaluation, and eWOM intention. The study uses a Facebook API to help participants pick five Facebook friends to act as their favorite sources for advice on shopping.Findings-The results suggest that consumers' deal evaluations (as shaped by the recency effects of previous exposure to prices and the influence of Facebook friends and C2C websites) have carry-over effects on their eWOM intentions. The influence of Facebook friends and C2C websites on deal evaluation is as powerful as that of reference price, especially concerning the mean and the lowest prices.Practical implications-The findings encourage marketers to invest their resources in targeting online groups, and suggest that C2C website marketers should set their offer prices between the mean and the lowest prices.Originality/value-This study extends prior research on the motives for eWOM dissemination and elaborates an approach to initiate eWOM intention through deal evaluation.",
Police CEOs and subordinates' perceptions of workplace misconduct Examining the effect of demographic similarity on attitudinal congruence,POLICING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICE STRATEGIES & MANAGEMENT,2017,2017,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether homophily - whereby people are influenced by those perceived as similar to themselves - affects attitudes toward police misconduct. Specifically, whether demographic dissimilarity between police chief executive law enforcement officers (CEOs) and subordinates is related to differences in perceptions of misconduct.Design/methodology/approach - The data for this research are drawn from the National Police Research Platform. Multilevel mixed-effects regression modeling is used to analyze data from 78 randomly selected US police agencies (78 law enforcement CEOs and 10,709 officers from those agencies).Findings - The main finding is that demographic dissimilarity between the CEO and subordinates is associated with differences in attitudes about police deviance, net of other factors.Practical implications - The results exemplify the need to diversify police agencies at all levels, not just the lower ranks. Because employees were found to be more similar to those one step (up or down) from one another on the organizational hierarchy, diversifying at all levels of the police organizations will help to reduce the social distance between those in closer ranks, which could ameliorate the dissimilarity effect. Likewise, police agencies may need to adopt new management strategies to compensate for a diversifying workforce.Originality/value - This study builds on previous research and investigates an understudied topic in the policing literature by assessing the extent to which dissimilarity is related to attitudinal congruence about workplace deviance in police organizations.",
Social network and inequalities in smoking amongst school-aged adolescents in six European countries,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Jan 2017,2017,"Smoking contributes to socio-economic health inequalities; but it is unclear how smoking inequalities emerge at a young age. So far, little attention has been paid to the role of friendship ties. We hypothesised that the combination of peer exposure and friendship social homophily may contribute to socio-economic inequalities in smoking at school.In 2013, a social network survey was carried out in 50 schools in six medium-size European cities (Namur, Tampere, Hanover, Latina, Amersfoort, and Coimbra). Adolescents in grades corresponding to the 14-to-16 age group were recruited (n = 11.015, participation rate = 79.4 %). We modelled adolescents' smoking behaviour as a function of socio-economic background, and analysed the mediating role of social homophily and peer exposure.Lower socio-economic groups were more likely to smoke and were more frequently exposed to smoking by their close and distant friends, compared with adolescents of higher SES. The smoking risk of the lowest socio-economic group decreased after controlling for friends smoking and social homophily.Smoking socio-economic inequalities amongst adolescents are driven by friendship networks.",
Knowledge Sharing Among Tourists via Social Media: A Comparison Between Facebook and TripAdvisor,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH,JAN-FEB 2017,2017,"This paper examines tourists' knowledge sharing behavior in social media. Based on social capital theory, we aim to examine the effects of three dimensions of social capital-structural (social interaction ties), cognitive (shared vision) and relational (trust)-for two different types of social media: Facebook and TripAdvisor. We propose a structural model that connects an antecedent (homophily) and a consequence (knowledge sharing through posting) of these main dimensions of social capital. An online survey is conducted with 1200 Spanish consumers. Based on the full sample, our structural equation modeling supports most of the hypothesized paths, while trust does not affect either social interaction ties or knowledge sharing. Examining the difference between Facebook and TripAdvisor, our multigroup analysis finds that neither trust nor shared vision drives knowledge sharing on TripAdvisor, while shared vision affects knowledge sharing in Facebook. In both media, social interaction ties play an important role in motivating users to post comments. The effects of homophily on social interaction ties and on shared vision were statistically greater in TripAdvisor than in Facebook. Homophily did not affect trust in either media. In closing, both theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, important limitations are recognized and future research directions are suggested.

Long-Term Performance Implications from Exploration-Exploitation Under Dynamic Segregation,Korean Journal of Management,2017,2017,"In balancing exploration and exploitation, one well-known fact is that firms emphasizing exploration over exploitation realize higher performance in the long-term than do firms emphasizing exploitation. This is because emphasis on exploration enables firms to maintain variability (or diversity). Studies that modeled organizational learning processes using agent-based modeling confirmed and replicated this tendency. However, most prior studies assumed learning among organizational members or learning between organizational code and individuals unfolds in a frictionless way. Considering the Carnegie School’s emphasis on inherent conflict as the most important characteristic of organizations, the assumption of frictionless learning may be relaxed. In the current study, we introduce Schelling’s (1971) model of dynamic segregation into March’s (1991) model of organizational learning. By doing so, we can examine performance implications of exploration and exploitation under the influence of homophily. Our results suggest that under low homophilc tendency, the long-term benefit from exploration emerges: the more the variability that exists in an organization, the higher the long-term performance becomes. This conventional relationship changes as we introduce higher levels of homophilic tendencies. With a mid-range homophilic tendency, the highest performance is realized when the level of variability is also in the middle. Under extremely high homophilic tendency, the benefit from variability disappears. We contribute to the literature on organizational learning by suggesting a boundary condition to the relationship between long-term performance and exploration-exploitation balance. We call for future work that suggests and identifies more nuanced organizational factors influencing the performance implications from exploration and exploitation.",
"Blood Is Thicker Than Water: Interpersonal Influence, Selection, and the Role of Family in Forging Italians' Political Agreement",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,2017,2017,"Mechanisms that are known to forge political agreement include interpersonal influence-the process by which people change their ideas according to others' attitudes-and selection-people's choice of their discussants according to their discussants' preferences. Using data obtained from a longitudinal survey, we test how these two processes contribute to changing vote choices or discussants around the 2014 European elections in Italy. Results partly confirm findings from the previous literature, showing influence and selection effects. Moreover, it is suggested that the family contributes crucially in stimulating strategies that result in political agreement. Propensities to maintain agreeable discussants over time and to change voting choice are boosted by exposure to family members.",
"Inequality, Labor Market Segmentation, and Preferences for Redistribution",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,Jan 2017,2017,"We formalize and examine two overlapping models that show how rising inequality combined with ethnic and racial heterogeneity can explain why many advanced industrial countries have experienced a drop in support for redistribution as inequality has risen. One model, based on altruism and homophily, focuses on the effect of increasing social distance between the poor and the middle class, especially when minorities are increasingly overrepresented among the very poor. The other, based on self-interest, combines an insurance model of preferences for redistribution with increasingly segmented labor markets, in which immigration of workers without recognized skills leaves most native workers better off but intensifies competition for low-end jobs. Empirically, when we estimate parameters from the two models using data from multiple waves of ISSP surveys, we find that labor market segmentation, previously omitted in this literature, has more consistent effects than social distance.",
Factors associated with syphilis seroreactivity among polydrug users in Northeast Brazil: A cross-sectional study using Respondent Driven Sampling,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY,Jan 2017,2017,"Background: The burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as syphilis, is higher in low-income countries, with serious consequences and profound impact on sexual and reproductive health and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spread. Syphilis prevalence tend to be higher among people who misuse drugs than in the general population.Objective: To assess syphilis and associated factors among polydrug users (PDU) in the city of Salvador, Northeast Brazil.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 Brazilian cities between September and November 2009 using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS). Participants answered an Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interview (ACASI) and were rapid tested for HIV and syphilis. We performed multivariable regression models for correlates of syphilis on Stata 10.0. Estimates were weighted by the inverse size of the individual social network size and homophily.Results: Mean age was 29.3 years (range: 18-62), 74.0% were males, and 89.8% were non-white. Syphilis prevalence was 16.6%. Females (adjwOR:2.14; 95%CI:1.09-4.20), individuals over 29 years old (adjwOR:4.44; 95%CI:2.41-8.19), those who exchanged sex for money or drugs (adjwOR:3.51; 95% CI:1.84-6.71), ""No/low"" self-perceived risk of HIV infection (adjwOR:5.13; 95%CI:1.36-19.37), and having nine or less years of education (adjwOR:2.92; 95%CI:1.08-7.88) were associated with syphilis.Conclusion: One of the most pressing needs for syphilis prevention/control is the availability of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and treatment. Interventions should be tailored to PDU needs and their multiple burdens as shown in the present study, that may contribute to future studies aiming to better understand the relationships between drug use and syphilis.

Social Media and News Perception: The Influence of Cognitive Social Networks on News Credibility Perception and Sharing Intention,Korean Journal of Broadcasting and Telecommunication Studies,2017,2017,"This study is an attempt to examine the effects individuals’ cognitive or perceived network, in addition to users’ psychological characteristics, have on the perceived credibility and sharing intention of news in social media. Cognitive social network refers to one’s subjective perceptions about the structure of local network in which s/he is embedded. First, perceived news credibility was found to increase as an individual’s anxiety about his or her current situation increased. However, when the level of social anxiety reached a midpoint, the degree of news credibility began to decline, revealing an inverted-U pattern. Of the variables for cognitive social network, centrality and preferential homophily had a positive effect, while demographic homophily had a negative effect. Furthermore, news sharing intention in social media was found to be positively associated with perceived news credibility, cognitive network centrality, and preferential homophily increased, while negatively associated with demographic homophily. In particular, intention to share increased as network centrality increased up to a certain point, after which the sharing intention began to decline. These results show that individuals’ news evaluation and sharing likelihood vary depending on their subjective perception of the local network structures as well as psychological traits.",
The strength of the work ties,INFORMATION SCIENCES,Jan 1 2017,2017,"College students often have to team up for class projects, and they select each other based not only on past performance (e.g., grades) but also on whether they have friendship ties (e.g., whether they trust each other). There has not been any study on the relationship between team formation for class projects and social media. To fix that, we ask two group of university students to tell us with whom they wish to work. Afterward, we gathered their online Facebook data and tested the predictors of team formation. We found that self-organized selection of team members does not strongly depend on past grades, but rather on Facebook-derived proxies for tie strength, popularity, extroversion and homophily. These results have important theoretical implications for the team formation literature and practical implications for online educational platforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Why Partisans Do Not Sort: The Constraints on Political Segregation,JOURNAL OF POLITICS,Jan 2017,2017,"Social divisions between American partisans are growing, with Republicans and Democrats exhibiting homophily in a range of seemingly nonpolitical domains. It has been widely claimed that this partisan social divide extends to Americans' decisions about where to live. In two original survey experiments, we confirm that Democrats are, in fact, more likely than Republicans to prefer living in more Democratic, dense, and racially diverse places. However, improving on previous studies, we test respondents' stated preferences against their actual moving behavior. While partisans differ in their residential preferences, on average they are not migrating to more politically distinct communities. Using zip-codelevel census and partisanship data on the places where respondents live, we provide one explanation for this contradiction: by prioritizing common concerns when deciding where to live, Americans forgo the opportunity to move to more politically compatible communities.",
Political Homophily in Social Relationships: Evidence from Online Dating Behavior,JOURNAL OF POLITICS,Jan 2017,2017,"Do people form relationships based upon political similarity? Past work has shown that social relationships are more politically similar than expected by chance, but the reason for this concordance is unclear. Is it because people prefer politically similar others, or is it attributable to confounding factors such as convergence, social structures, and sorting on nonpolitical characteristics? Addressing this question is challenging because we typically do not observe partners prior to relationship formation. Consequently, we leverage the domain of online dating. We first conducted a nationwide experiment in which we randomized political characteristics in dating profiles. Second, we analyzed behavioral data from a national online dating community. We find that people evaluate potential dating partners more favorably and are more likely to reach out to them when they have similar political characteristics. The magnitude of the effect is comparable to that of educational homophily and half as large as racial homophily.",
The (Anti)Social Network: Egocentric Friendship Networks of Incarcerated Youth,DEVIANT BEHAVIOR,2017,2017,The present study uses egocentric networks collected from youth (aged 14-24) incarcerated with California's Division of Juvenile Justice to examine the composition and structure of youth's friendship networks during periods of incarceration and to test the relationship between friendship and institutional misconduct. Tests of network homophily reveal that youth networks report more diversity across both racial/ethnic categories and gang membership than expected from non-network research about inmate organization. Regression results indicate that youth who stated they had no close friendships within the facility had a lower rate of institutional misconduct post-interview compared to those who nominated peer friendships. The current study demonstrates that incarcerated youth are capable of building close friendships and highlights the potential of these friendships to affect a youth's level of institutional misconduct.,
Relationships Between Social Networks and Mental Health An Exponential Random Graph Model Approach among Romanian Adolescents,SWISS JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY,Jan 2017,2017,"Social networks have an important effect on health, and social network analysis has become essential for understanding human behavior and vulnerability. Using exponential random graph models (ERGM), this study explores the associations between mental health and network structure (or more specifically, mental health homophily) and the association between poor mental health and social isolation. Two classes of Romanian adolescents aged 12-14 years participated in the study (n = 26 in each class). We assessed school network, sociodemo-graphic covariates, and mental health using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). ERGM was first used to test the presence of sex and mental health homophily and then to test whether mental health was a predictor of social isolation. The results showed homophily patterns regarding sex and mental health. Moreover, participants with a higher SDQ score had a lower probability of a tie. Overall, this study showed how social networks are structured with different forms of homophily and that adolescents with poor mental health are more likely to be social isolates. Thus, prevention and interventions should focus on these vulnerable adolescents. Methodological advances like ERGM constitute a promising avenue for further research.",
Status seeking and perceived similarity: A consideration of homophily in the social servicescape,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT,Jan 2017,2017,"It is not clear in the extant research whether all consumers respond to the social servicescape in the same way or whether there may be moderators and mediators of the proposed relationships. The purpose of this research is to establish the moderating effect of consumers' need for status and the mediating effect of self-image congruence on the relationship between the perceived similarity to other customers and self-brand congruity in the proposed conceptual framework. Data collected from a sample of restaurant consumers in the United States suggests that perceptions of perceived similarity to other customers can significantly affect both self-image congruence and self-brand congruence. Further, the data indicate that the consumer's need for status is a significant moderator and self-image congruence is a significant mediator of the proposed relationships. Theoretical implications, managerial relevance, and future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",
Network sampling coverage II: The effect of non-random missing data on network measurement,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2017,2017,"Missing data is an important, but often ignored, aspect of a network study. Measurement validity is affected by missing data, but the level of bias can be difficult to gauge. Here, we describe the effect of missing data on network measurement across widely different circumstances. In Part I of this study (Smith and Moody, 2013), we explored the effect of measurement bias due to randomly missing nodes. Here, we drop the assumption that data are missing at random: what happens to estimates of key network statistics when central nodes are more/less likely to be missing? We answer this question using a wide range of empirical networks and network measures. We find that bias is worse when more central nodes are missing. With respect to network measures, Bonacich centrality is highly sensitive to the loss of central nodes, while closeness centrality is not; distance and bicomponent size are more affected than triad summary measures and behavioral homophily is more robust than degree-homophily. With respect to types of networks, larger, directed networks tend to be more robust, but the relation is weak. We end the paper with a practical application, showing how researchers can use our results (translated into a publically available java application) to gauge the bias in their own data.

"Avoidance in negative ties: Inhibiting closure, reciprocity, and homophily",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2017,2017,"Theorising of negative ties has focused on simplex negative tie networks or multiplex signed tie networks. We examine the fundamental differences between positive and negative tie networks measured on the same set of actors. We test six mechanisms of tie formation on face-to-face positive (affect/esteem) and negative (dislike/disesteem) networks of 282 university students. While popularity, activity, and entrainment are present in both networks, closure, reciprocity, and homophily are largely absent from negative tie networks. We argue this arises because avoidance is inherent to negative sentiments. Avoidance reduces information transfer through negative ties and short-circuits cumulative causation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Conditionally exponential random models for individual properties and network structures: Method and application,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2017,2017,"Exponential random models have been widely adopted as a general probabilistic framework for complex networks and recently extended to embrace broader statistical settings such as dynamic networks, valued networks or two-mode networks. Our aim is to provide a further step into the generalization of this class of models by considering sample spaces which involve both families of networks and nodal properties verifying combinatorial constraints. We propose a class of probabilistic models for the joint distribution of nodal properties (demographic and behavioral characteristics) and network structures (friendship and professional partnership). It results in a general and flexible modeling framework to account for homophily in social structures. We present a Bayesian estimation method based on the full characterization of their sample spaces by systems of linear constraints. This provides an exact simulation scheme to sample from the likelihood, based on linear programming techniques. After a detailed analysis of the proposed statistical methodology, we illustrate our approach with an empirical analysis of co-authorship of journal articles in the field of neuroscience between 2009 and 2013.

Modeling and Analysis of Glass Ceiling and Power Inequality in Bi-populated Societies,3RD INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOL AND CONFERENCE ON NETWORK SCIENCE,2017,2017,"This paper attempts to rigorously analyze the social effects of power inequality and glass ceiling in a society with two populations (e.g. men and women). To this end, we define a mathematical model based on a social network with two populations, in which these phenomena are studied. We define measures for Normalized (or Differential) Power Inequality and Full-Spectrum Glass Ceiling, and formalize the conditions for their existence in terms of three societal parameters, the relative size of the two populations, the level of homophily, and the extent of the ""leaky pipeline"" phenomenon.",
Collaboration Trumps Homophily in Urban Mobile Crowd-sourcing,CSCW'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK AND SOCIAL COMPUTING,2017,2017,"This paper establishes the power of dynamic collaborative task completion among workers for urban mobile crowd-sourcing. Collaboration is defined via the notion of peer referrals, whereby a worker who has accepted a location-specific task, but is unlikely to visit that location, offloads the task to a willing friend. Such a collaborative framework might be particularly useful for task bundles, especially for bundles that have higher geographic dispersion. The challenge, however, comes from the high similarity observed in the spatio-temporal pattern of task completion among friends. Using extensive real-world crowd-sourcing studies conducted over 7 weeks and 1000+ workers on a campus-based crowd-sourcing platform, we quantify the effect of such ""task completion homophily"", and show that incorporating such peer-preferences can improve worker-specific models of task preferences by over 30%. We then show that such collaborative offloading works in spite of such spatio-temporal similarity, primarily because workers refer tasks to their close friends, who in turn perform such peer-requested tasks (with over 95% completion rate) even if they experience detours that are significantly larger (often more than twice) than what they normally tolerate for platform-recommended tasks.",
The Co-Evolution Model for Social Network Evolving and Opinion Migration,KDD'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING,2017,2017,"Almost all real-world social networks are dynamic and evolving with time, where new links may form and old links may drop, largely determined by the homophily of social actors (i.e., nodes in the network). Meanwhile, (latent) properties of social actors, such as their opinions, are changing along the time, partially due to social influence received from the network, which will in turn affect the network structure. Social network evolution and node property migration are usually treated as two orthogonal problems, and have been studied separately. In this paper, we propose a co-evolution model that closes the loop by modeling the two phenomena together, which contains two major components: (1) a network generative model when the node property is known; and (2) a property migration model when the social network structure is known. Simulation shows that our model has several nice properties: (1) it can model a broad range of phenomena such as opinion convergence (i.e., herding) and community-based opinion divergence; and (2) it allows to control the evolution via a set of factors such as social influence scope, opinion leader, and noise level. Finally, the usefulness of our model is demonstrated by an application of co-sponsorship prediction for legislative bills in Congress, which outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.",
Unsupervised Feature Selection in Signed Social Networks,KDD'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING,2017,2017,"The rapid growth of social media services brings a large amount of high-dimensional social media data at an unprecedented rate. Feature selection is powerful to prepare high-dimensional data by finding a subset of relevant features. A vast majority of existing feature selection algorithms for social media data exclusively focus on positive interactions among linked instances such as friendships and user following relations. However, in many real-world social networks, instances may also be negatively interconnected. Recent work shows that negative links have an added value over positive links in advancing many learning tasks. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised feature selection in signed social networks and propose a novel framework SignedFS. In particular, we provide a principled way to model positive and negative links for user latent representation learning. Then we embed the user latent representations into feature selection when label information is not available. Also, we revisit the principle of homophily and balance theory in signed social networks and incorporate the signed graph regularization into the feature selection framework to capture the first-order and the second-order proximity among users in signed social networks. Experiments on two real-world signed social networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to understand the impacts of different components of SignedFS.",
Structural Diversity and Homophily: A Study Across More Than One Hundred Big Networks,KDD'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING,2017,2017,"A widely recognized organizing principle of networks is structural homophily, which suggests that people with more common neighbors are more likely to connect with each other. However, what influence the diverse structures embedded in common neighbors (e.g., (sic) and (sic)) have on link formation is much less well-understood. To explore this problem, we begin by characterizing the structural diversity of common neighborhoods. Using a collection of 120 large-scale networks, we demonstrate that the impact of the common neighborhood diversity on link existence can vary substantially across networks. We find that its positive effect on Facebook and negative effect on Linkedln suggest different underlying networking needs in these networks. We also discover striking cases where diversity violates the principle of homophily that is, where fewer mutual connections may lead to a higher tendency to link with each other. We then leverage structural diversity to develop a common neighborhood signature (CNS), which we apply to a large set of networks to uncover unique network superfamilies not discoverable by conventional methods. Our findings shed light on the pursuit to understand the ways in which network structures are organized and formed, pointing to potential advancement in designing graph generation models and recommender systems.",
Characterizing Regional and Behavioral Device Variations Across the Twitter Timeline: a Longitudinal Study,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM WEB SCIENCE CONFERENCE (WEBSCI '17),2017,2017,"Physical devices, such as smartphones and laptops, provide the key interface through which users engage with the social media world. Yet despite the broad range of devices used on social media platforms, relatively little is known about how usage varies on a device to device level. In this work, we use a 10% sample of Twitter data spanning two consecutive years and encompassing 365.98 million users to perform a longitudinal, measurement -driven analysis of five prevalent device types - Android, iPhone-iOS, BlackBerry, other mobile devices, and nonmobile devices - across the time period. We study the global and regional usage patterns, as well as the regional distribution, of devices; investigate differences and similarities in behavioral patterns across devices with respect to tweet sentiment, daytime usage patterns, and feature usage (such as mentions, URLs, hashtags) over time; and quantify the level of ""device homophily"" (i.e., assortativity) within the Twitter device network. Our results reveal that key variations exist among these device groups, in addition to notable similarities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale longitudinal analysis of various distinct Twitter devices.",
Sampling from Social Networks with Attributes,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW'17),2017,2017,"Sampling from large networks represents a fundamental challenge for social network research. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of different sampling techniques (node sampling, edge sampling, random walk sampling, and snowball sampling) on social networks with attributes. We consider the special case of networks (i) where we have one attribute with two values (e.g., male and female in the case of gender), (ii) where the size of the two groups is unequal (e.g., a male majority and a female minority), and (iii) where nodes with the same or different attribute value attract or repel each other (i.e., homophilic or heterophilic behavior). We evaluate the different sampling techniques with respect to conserving the position of nodes and the visibility of groups in such networks. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic and empirical social networks. Our results provide evidence that different network sampling techniques are highly sensitive with regard to capturing the expected centrality of nodes, and that their accuracy depends on relative group size differences and on the level of homophily that can be observed in the network. We conclude that uninformed sampling from social networks with attributes thus can significantly impair the ability of researchers to draw valid conclusions about the centrality of nodes and the visibility or invisibility of groups in social networks.",
Raising Graphs From Randomness to Reveal Information Networks,WSDM'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB SEARCH AND DATA MINING,2017,2017,"We analyze the fine-grained connections between the average degree and the power-law degree distribution exponent in growing information networks. Our starting observation is a power-law degree distribution with a decreasing exponent and increasing average degree as a function of the network size. Our experiments are based on three Twitter at mention networks and three more from the Koblenz Network Collection. We observe that popular network models cannot explain decreasing power-law degree distribution exponent and increasing average degree at the same time.We propose a model that is the combination of exponential growth, and a power-law developing network, in which new ""homophily"" edges are continuously added to nodes proportional to their current homophily degree. Parameters of the average degree growth and the power-law degree distribution exponent functions depend on the ratio of the network growth exponent parameters. Specifically, we connect the growth of the average degree to the decreasing exponent of the power-law degree distribution. Prior to our work, only one of the two cases were handled. Existing models and even their combinations can only reproduce some of our key new observations in growing information networks.",
Detecting and Characterizing Eating-Disorder Communities on Social Media,WSDM'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB SEARCH AND DATA MINING,2017,2017,"Eating disorders are complex mental disorders and responsible for the highest mortality rate among mental illnesses. Recent studies reveal that user-generated content on social media provides useful information in understanding these disorders. Most previous studies focus on studying communities of people who discuss eating disorders on social media, while few studies have explored community structures and interactions among individuals who suffer from this disease over social media. In this paper, we first develop a snowball sampling method to automatically gather individuals who self-identify as eating disordered in their profile descriptions, as well as their social network connections with one another on Twitter. Then, we verify the effectiveness of our sampling method by: 1. quantifying differences between the sampled eating disordered users and two sets of reference data collected for non-disordered users in social status, behavioral patterns and psychometric properties; 2. building predictive models to classify eating disordered and non-disordered users. Finally, leveraging the data of social connections between eating disordered individuals on Twitter, we present the first homophily study among eating-disorder communities on social media. Our findings shed new light on how an eating-disorder community develops on social media.",
Modeling Document Networks with Tree-Averaged Copula Regularization,WSDM'17: PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB SEARCH AND DATA MINING,2017,2017,"Document network is a kind of intriguing dataset which provides both topical (texts) and topological (links) information. Most previous work assumes that documents closely linked with each other share common topics. However, the associations among documents are usually complex, which are not limited to the homophily (i.e., tendency to link to similar others). Actually, the heterophily (i.e., tendency to link to different others) is another pervasive phenomenon in social networks. In this paper, we introduce, a new tool, called copula, to separately model the documents and links, so that different copula functions can be applied to capture different correlation patterns. In statistics, a copula is a powerful framework for explicitly modeling the dependence of random variables by separating the marginals and their correlations. Though widely used in Economics, copulas have not been paid enough attention to by researchers in machine learning field. Besides, to further capture the potential associations amoug the unconnected documents, we apply the tree-averaged copula instead of a single copula function. This improvement makes our model achieve better expressive power, and also more elegant in algebra. We derive efficient EM algorithms to estimate the model parameters, and evaluate the performance of our model on three different datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements on both topic and link modeling compared with the current state of the art.",
Can longitudinal generalized estimating equation models distinguish network influence and homophily? An agent-based modeling approach to measurement characteristics,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,Dec 28 2016,2016,"Background: Connected individuals (or nodes) in a network are more likely to be similar than two randomly selected nodes due to homophily and/or network influence. Distinguishing between these two influences is an important goal in network analysis, and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses of longitudinal dyadic network data are an attractive approach. It is not known to what extent such regressions can accurately extract underlying data generating processes. Therefore our primary objective is to determine to what extent, and under what conditions, does the GEE-approach recreate the actual dynamics in an agent-based model.Methods: We generated simulated cohorts with pre-specified network characteristics and attachments in both static and dynamic networks, and we varied the presence of homophily and network influence. We then used statistical regression and examined the GEE model performance in each cohort to determine whether the model was able to detect the presence of homophily and network influence.Results: In cohorts with both static and dynamic networks, we find that the GEE models have excellent sensitivity and reasonable specificity for determining the presence or absence of network influence, but little ability to distinguish whether or not homophily is present.Conclusions: The GEE models are a valuable tool to examine for the presence of network influence in longitudinal data, but are quite limited with respect to homophily.",
Popularity and peer relationships in the classroom: A prospective study,PSICOLOGIA EDUCATIVA,Dec 2016,2016,"This paper analyzes in depth the network of popularity among classmates and the connections that this phenomenon maintains with different kinds of relationships (i.e., positive, neutral, and negative) that take place within the classroom. We use Social Network Analysis (SNA) to identify interaction contexts in the classroom. Different kinds of relationships in 20 classrooms from two secondary schools located in the suburban area of Mexico City were assessed. The research data was provided by 660 students (67% girls; 33% boys). Cohesion measures were calculated for positive, neutral, negative, and popularity networks. Cluster analysis shows two profiles based on structural properties of the networks that we have called ""Neutral Symmetric"" and ""Positive Asymmetric"". The first one presents low homophily relative to sex, predominance of positive and neutral relationships, and a significant level of negative links. The second profile presents a heterogeneous distribution according to sex, high homophily and high rates of cohesion in positive relationships. Regression analysis shows that the number of students per class is negatively related to the positive network density, and positively related to the negative network density. The simultaneous comparison of multiple networks shows that popularity is associated with being immersed in positive relationships. By contrast, the data suggest certain incompatibility between being popular and being immersed in negative relationships. The findings are discussed in order to improve school life and public policies in education. (C) 2016 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.",
Structural estimation of pairwise stable networks with nonnegative externality,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,Dec 2016,2016,"This paper develops a framework to structurally estimate pairwise stable networks with nonnegative externality. We characterize pairwise stable equilibria as a fixed point of a certain mapping and show that the set of pairwise stable equilibria with nonnegative externality is a complete lattice. We extend the characterization to an econometric framework for structural estimation based on the moment inequality model. We apply our methodology to friendship networks of students in the United States, using data from Add-Health. We find that the preference toward racial homophily is overestimated if we do not control for the preference toward clustering. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Homophilic network decomposition: a community-centric analysis of online social services,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,Dec 2016,2016,"In this paper we formulate the homophilic network decomposition problem: Is it possible to identify a network partition whose structure is able to characterize the degree of homophily of its nodes? The aim of our work is to understand the relations between the homophily of individuals and the topological features expressed by specific network substructures. We apply several community detection algorithms on three large-scale online social networks-Skype, LastFM and Google+- and advocate the need of identifying the right algorithm for each specific network in order to extract a homophilic network decomposition. Our results show clear relations between the topological features of communities and the degree of homophily of their nodes in three online social scenarios: product engagement in the Skype network, number of listened songs on LastFM and homogeneous level of education among users of Google+.",
A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF EGOCENTRIC SOCIAL NETWORKS IN PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH: A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE,ZDRAVSTVENO VARSTVO,Dec 2016,2016,"Introduction. Research on social networks in public health focuses on how social structures and relationships influence health and health-related behaviour. While the sociocentric approach is used to study complete social networks, the egocentric approach is gaining popularity because of its focus on individuals, groups and communities.Methods. One of the participants of the healthy lifestyle health education workshop 'I'm moving', included in the study of social support for exercise was randomly selected. The participant was denoted as the ego and members of her/his social network as the alteri. Data were collected by personal interviews using a self-made questionnaire. Numerical methods and computer programmes for the analysis of social networks were used for the demonstration of analysis.Results. The size, composition and structure of the egocentric social network were obtained by a numerical analysis. The analysis of composition included homophily and homogeneity. Moreover, the analysis of the structure included the degree of the egocentric network, the strength of the ego-alter ties and the average strength of ties. Visualisation of the network was performed by three freely available computer programmes, namely: Egonet. QF, E-net and Pajek. The computer programmes were described and compared by their usefulness.Conclusion. Both numerical analysis and visualisation have their benefits. The decision what approach to use is depending on the purpose of the social network analysis. While the numerical analysis can be used in large-scale population-based studies, visualisation of personal networks can help health professionals at creating, performing and evaluation of preventive programmes, especially if focused on behaviour change.",
Discovering Similarity and Dissimilarity Relations for Knowledge Propagation in Web Ontologies,JOURNAL ON DATA SEMANTICS,Dec 2016,2016,"We focus on the problem of predicting missing class memberships and property assertions in Web Ontologies. We start from the assumption that related entities influence each other, and they may be either similar or dissimilar with respect to a given set of properties: the former case is referred to as homophily, and the latter as heterophily. We present an efficient method for predicting missing class and property assertions for a set of individuals within an ontology by: identifying relations that are likely to encode influence relations between individuals (learning phase) and Leveraging such relations for propagating property information across related entities (inference phase). We show that the complexity of both inference and learning is nearly linear in the number of edges in the influence graph, and we provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed method.",
Networks of international student mobility: enlargement and consolidation of the European transnational education space?,HIGHER EDUCATION,Dec 2016,2016,"In this paper, we investigate the impact of membership in the Bologna Process on patterns and driving forces of cross-national student mobility. Student exchange flows are analyzed for almost all Bologna Process member states and non-Bologna OECD members over a ten-year period (from 2000 to 2010). We apply a social network approach focusing on outbound diploma mobility. Based on social network analyses, we first visualize the exchange patterns between sampled countries. In doing so, we analyze the student exchange linkages to gain descriptive insights into the development of the network. Second, we use exponential random graph models (ERGM) to test which factors determine transnational student mobility. The results of our network analyses reveal that cross-national student exchange networks are stable over time. At the core of these networks are the USA, Great Britain, France, and Germany; they attract highest shares of students from most remaining countries in our sample. Moreover, the results of the ERGM demonstrate that homophily between countries determines student exchange patterns. The most relevant ties exist between bordering countries. Moreover, membership in the Bologna Process impacts on mobility patterns, and the effect size increases over the periods investigated.",
Life course similarities on social networking sites,ADVANCES IN LIFE COURSE RESEARCH,Dec 2016,2016,"Dyadic social relations are known to exhibit homophily - attraction and bonding between similar individuals - and recent studies have detected homophily also on the social network level. Here, we investigate whether social media networks exhibit signs of homophily with regards to life stages. Using a large and global database (N = 111,863) of social media profile pictures, we investigate proportions of picture types in an individual's social network. Typical stages of young adulthood include peer group formation, mate searching, union formation, and parenting. We studied to what extent different association categories with pictures of one or several individuals correlated with each other. Results showed that users with a profile picture of a single individual were more likely to have other profile pictures of single individuals of the opposite sex, but not of the same sex, in their social media network. Profile pictures of heterosexual couples were more likely to appear with other heterosexual couple pictures, and profiles with baby pictures were strongly associated with the frequency of other baby pictures within the same network; both of these types were negatively associated with the frequency of pictures of singles. Pictures of two females together were positively linked with the largest number of other association types. The results probably reflect both selection and contagion effects. We conclude that contemporary social media networks appear to exhibit homophily in displays related to mate searching, pair bonds, and the transition to parenthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Physical activity by children: an analysis based on Social Network Theory,Revista de la Universidad Industrial de Santander. Salud,2016-12,2016,"Introduction: Physical inactivity is a risk factor for obesity and non-transmissible chronic diseases; this represents a burden for health services and limits the development of social capital. Objective: To identify the structure of the school and the community social network for the practice of structured and unstructured physical activity (PA) by schoolchildren. Methods: Cross-sectional study based on Social Network Theory conducted in Morelos, Mexico. A convenience sample of 33 children aged 8 to 10 years-old was selected from two public elementary schools. PA evaluations through pedometry, anthropometric assessments, and PA social network assessments (size, density, homophily, and centrality of actors) were performed. Results: The overall PA network was composed by 239 actors that were mostly peers (40.2%). The school sub-network had an average of 122 actors (87.0% children/peers and 13.0% teachers). Most children conducted PA in groups with their peers; overweight/obese children (mostly girls) lingered in the periphery of the school sub-network. The community sub-network had an average of 160 actors (55.0% parents/family members, 41.2% children/peers, and 3.8% Soccer-coaches). This sub-network, composed mostly by men (60.6%), was highly fragmented (19 sets of actors); they generally promoted unstructured ""masculine"" activities. The girls who did not perform structured PA and did not meet the recommended number of steps/day were in isolated and small community networks. Conclusions: School teachers are key actors in promoting structured PA. Male peers stand out as promoters of unstructured activity in the school and the community. Overweight and obese girls are a vulnerable group by having fragmented social networks. Public health interventions based in social networks should empower girls motor activity and adult women to become prestige leaders for promoting PA among children.",
YouTube vloggers' influence on consumer luxury brand perceptions and intentions,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,Dec 2016,2016,"This study examines how video blogs (vlogs) influence consumer perceptions of luxury brands. Using para-social interaction (PSI) and social comparison theory, this study proposes a model that assesses the influence of physical attractiveness, social attractiveness, and attitude homophily of video blogger (vlogger) on PSI; and PSI effects on luxury brand perceptions (i.e., brand luxury, luxury brand value, and brand-user-imagery fit) and luxury brand purchase intentions. Study 1 tests the hypothesized model using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results supported the proposed model. Using within-subject design by comparing pre- and post-luxury perceptions, Study 2 finds luxury brand perceptions were significantly increased after watching vlog and increases were moderated by PSI with the vlogger. Study 3 investigated vlog effects on luxury brand perceptions and purchase intentions using between-subject design. Results show that luxury brand perceptions and purchase intentions for the experimental groups, who watched vlogs reviewing luxury products, were higher than control group, who did not watch vlog. Overall, the findings generally support for PSI as a brand management tool and the use of YouTube for positive perceptions of luxury brands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Efficient respondents selection for biased survey using homophily-high social relation graph,DISCRETE MATHEMATICS ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS,Dec 2016,2016,"Online social relationships which can be extracted from various online resources such as online social networks are getting much attention from the research communities since they are rich resources to learn about the members of our society as well as the relationships among them. With the advances of Internet related technologies, online surveys are established as an essential tool for a wide range of applications. One significant issue of online survey is how to select a quality respondent group so that the survey result is reliable. This paper studies the use of pairwise online social relationships among the members of a society to form a biased survey respondent group, which might be useful for various applications. We first introduce a way to construct a homophily-high social relation graph. Then, we introduce the minimum inverse k-core dominating set problem (MIkCDSP), which aims to compute a biased respondent group using the homophily-high social relation graph. We show the problem is NP-hard and most importantly propose a greedy approximation for it. Our simulation based on a real social network shows the proposed algorithm is very effective.",
On cost-aware biased respondent group selection for minority opinion survey,DISCRETE MATHEMATICS ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS,Dec 2016,2016,"This paper discusses a new approach to use a specially constructed social relation graph with high homophily to select a survey respondent group under a limited budget such that the result of the survey is biased to the minority opinions. This approach has a wide range of potential applications, e.g., collecting diversified complaints from the customers while most of them are satisfied, but is hardly investigated. We formulate the problem of computing such a group as the p-biased-representative selection problem (p-BRSP), where p represents the size of the group constraint by the available budget. This problem has two independent optimization goals and therefore is difficult to deal with. We introduce two polynomial time algorithms for the problem, where each of which has an approximation ratio with respect to each of the objectives when the other optimization objective is substituted with a constraint. Under the substituted constraint, we prove that the first algorithm is an O(ln Delta)-approximation (which is best possible) algorithm with respect to the first objective and the second algorithm is a 2-approximation ( which is best possible) with respect to the second objective, where Delta is the degree of the input social relation graph.",
Gender and Age Segregation and Stratification in Criminal Collaborations,JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY,Dec 2016,2016,"Assess gender and age segregation and stratification among co-offenders.The population comprises co-offenders aged 5-75 in police-reported co-offenses in Canada, 2006-2009. Segregation is indicated by observed and inbreeding homophily, measured with cross-tabulations and log-linear distance models. Stratification is assessed with elaborations by crime type. Intersectionality of gender and age status is estimated with interaction terms in the log-linear models.Female and younger offenders are over-represented among co-offenders. Co-offending exhibits gender and age status homophily: same-gender dyads are approximately twice as frequent as mixed-gender, and same-age-status dyads are almost 7 times as frequent as mixed-age-status. Gender homophily varies by crime type, being stronger in robbery, aggravated assault, common assault, and minor theft, and weaker in serious drug crime and homicide, and (especially) sex crimes against children. Age homophily is strong in all types of crime. Gender and age homophily have a negative interaction: dyads comprising a female child or youth and an adult male occur 1.4 times as frequently as predicted from the main effects of gender and age status.Female and younger offenders are not excluded from co-offending per se but, consistent with expectations from Blau's (Inequality and heterogeneity. Free Press, New York, 1977) and Steffensmeier's (Soc Forces 6:1010-1032, 1983) theories, they are segregated from co-offending with male and (especially) adult offenders. There was limited evidence of gender stratification, and no evidence of age stratification. The interaction of gender and age status in the segregation and stratification of co-offending attenuates their individual effects, contrary to expectations from feminist intersectionality theory and consistent with Blau's (1977) theory.",
Fixation Results for the Two-Feature Axelrod Model with a Variable Number of Opinions,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PROBABILITY,Dec 2016,2016,"The Axelrod model is a spatial stochastic model for the dynamics of cultures that includes two key social mechanisms: homophily and social influence, respectively, defined as the tendency of individuals to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar and the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they interact. The original model assumes that individuals are located on the vertex set of an interaction network and are characterized by their culture, a vector of opinions about F cultural features, each of which offering the same number q of alternatives. Pairs of neighbors interact at a rate proportional to the number of cultural features for which they agree, which results in one more agreement between the two neighbors. In this article, we study a more general and more realistic version of the standard Axelrod model that allows for a variable number of opinions across cultural features, say possible alternatives for the ith cultural feature. Our main result shows that the one-dimensional system with two cultural features fixates when .",
Identifying and validating personality traits-based homophilies for an egocentric network,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,Dec 2016,2016,"Social network sites (SNS) have touched the lives of millions of people around the world. People share interests, ideas, photos, activities in the social networks with their family, colleagues, friends and acquaintances. However, the degree of interactions among members widely varies. According to a sociology principle, people with similar personality often interact with each other more frequently. A group of connected people with similar personality traits is termed as a homophily. In this paper, we develop a method to identify homophilies by analyzing the Big5 personality traits of users from their interactions in an egocentric network like Facebook. We observe that our homophilies correctly cluster ranged from 73 to 87 % users for different personality traits. We also present a novel validation technique to verify those extracted homophilies in real life. Note that we are the first to validate the extracted homophilies and compare those with baseline techniques from SNS usage in real life using an interview-based method. We notice that our validation results show different agreements ranged from 0.207 (fair) to 0.709 (substantial) among the raters of those homophilies in real-life",
"An agent-based simulation of persistent inequalities in health behavior: Understanding the interdependent roles of segregation, clustering, and social influence",SSM-POPULATION HEALTH,Dec 2016,2016,"Health inequalities are conspicuously persistent through time and often durable even in spite of interventions. In this study, I use agent-based simulation models (ABMs) to understand how the complex interrelationships between residential segregation, social network formation, group-level preferences, and social influence may contribute to this persistence. I use a more-stylized ABM, Bubblegum Village (BV), to understand how initial inequalities in bubblegum-chewing behaviors either endure, increase, or decrease over time given group-level differences in preferences, neighborhood-level barriers or facilitators of bubblegum chewing (e.g., access to bubblegum shops), and agents' preferences for segregation, homophily, and clustering (i.e., the 'tightness' of social networks). I further use BV to understand whether segregation and social network characteristics impact whether the effects of a bubblegum-reduction intervention that is very effective in the short term are durable over time, as well as to identify intervention strategies to reduce attenuation of the intervention effects. In addition to BV, I also present results from an ABM based on the distribution and social characteristics of the population in Philadelphia, PA. This model explores similar questions to BV, but examines racial/ethnic inequalities in soda consumption based on agents' social characteristics and baseline soda consumption probabilities informed by the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Collectively, the models suggest that residential segregation is a fundamental process for the production and persistence of health inequalities. The other major conclusion of the study is that, for behaviors that are subject to social influence and that cluster within social groups, interventions that are randomly-targeted to individuals with 'bad' behaviors will likely experience a large degree of recidivism to pre-intervention behaviors. In contrast, interventions that target multiple members of the same network, as well as multilevel interventions that include a neighborhood-level component, can reduce recidivism.",
SNCStream(+) : Extending a high quality true anytime data stream clustering algorithm,INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Dec 2016,2016,"Data Stream Clustering is an active area of research which requires efficient algorithms capable of finding and updating clusters incrementally as data arrives. On top of that, due to the inherent evolving nature of data streams, it is expected that algorithms undergo both concept drifts and evolutions, which must be taken into account by the clustering algorithm, allowing incremental clustering updates. In this paper we present the Social Network Clusterer Stream(+) (SNCStream(+)). SNCStream(+) tackles the data stream clustering problem as a network formation and evolution problem, where instances and micro clusters form clusters based on homophily. Our proposal has its parameters analyzed and it is evaluated in a broad set of problems against literature baselines. Results show that SNCStream+ achieves superior clustering quality (CMM), and feasible processing time and memory space usage when compared to the original SNCStream and other proposals of the literature.

Your Health Buddies Matter: Preferential Selection and Social Influence on Weight Management in an Online Health Social Network,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,Dec 2016,2016,"A growing number of online social networks are designed with the intention to promote health by providing virtual space wherein individuals can seek and share information and support with similar others. Research has shown that real-world social networks have a significant influence on one's health behavior and outcomes. However, there is a dearth of studies on how individuals form social networks in virtual space and whether such online social networks exert any impact on individuals' health outcomes. Built on the Multi-Theoretical Multilevel (MTML) framework and drawing from literature on social influence, this study examined the mechanisms underlying the formation of an online health social network and empirically tested social influence on individual health outcomes through the network. Situated in a weight management social networking site, the study tracked a health buddy network of 709 users and their weight management activities and outcomes for 4months. Actor-based modeling was used to test the joint dynamics of preferential selection and social influence among health buddies. The results showed that baseline, inbreeding, and health status homophily significantly predicted preferential selection of health buddies in the weight management social networking site, whereas self-interest in seeking experiential health information did not. The study also found peer influence of online health buddy networks on individual weight outcomes, such that an individual's odds of losing weight increased if, on average, the individual's health buddies were losing weight.",
Using weak ties to understand the resource usage and sharing patterns of a professional learning community,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,Dec 2016,2016,"This research demonstrates the utility of the theory of weak ties for understanding the patterns of resource usage and sharing in an online professional learning community. Our context of study is a community of educators using and sharing teaching resources such as lesson plans, presentation slides and animations. We consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community of educators constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two educators access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties, then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network in terms of their propensity to use and share resources and their level of comfort with and use of technology (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property (formation of a weak tie between unconnected nodes that share a common neighbor). Thus, we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8 %. Finally, we show that augmenting collaborative and hybrid recommender systems with our triadic closure prediction model can improve the performance of these systems.",
The social network around influenza vaccination in health care workers: a cross-sectional study,IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE,Nov 24 2016,2016,"Background: Influenza vaccination coverage remains low among health care workers (HCWs) in many health facilities. This study describes the social network defined by HCWs' conversations around an influenza vaccination campaign in order to describe the role played by vaccination behavior and other HCW characteristics in the configuration of the links among subjects.Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from 235 HCWs interviewed after the 2010/ 2011 influenza vaccination campaign at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB), Spain. The study asked: "" Who did you talk to or share some activity with respect to the seasonal vaccination campaign?"" Variables studied included sociodemographic characteristics and reported conversations among HCWs during the influenza campaign. Exponential random graph models (ERGM) were used to assess the role of shared characteristics (homophily) and individual characteristics in the social network around the influenza vaccination campaign.Results: Links were more likely between HCWs who shared the same professional category (OR 3.13, 95% CI = 2.61-3.75), sex (OR 1.34, 95% CI = 1.09-1.62), age (OR 0.7, 95% CI = 0.63-0.78 per decade of difference), and department (OR 11.35, 95% CI = 8.17-15.64), but not between HCWs who shared the same vaccination behavior (OR 1.02, 95% CI = 0.86-1.22). Older (OR 1.26, 95% CI = 1.14-1.39 per extra decade of HCW) and vaccinated (OR 1.32, 95% CI = 1.09-1.62) HCWs were more likely to be named.Conclusions: This study finds that there is no homophily by vaccination status in whom HCWs speak to or interact with about a workplace vaccination promotion campaign. This result highlights the relevance of social network analysis in the planning of health promotion interventions.",
"Does size really matter? A sensitivity analysis of number of seeds in a respondent-driven sampling study of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Vancouver, Canada",BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,Nov 16 2016,2016,"Background: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is an increasingly used peer chain-recruitment method to sample ""hard-to-reach"" populations for whom there are no reliable sampling frames. Implementation success of RDS varies; one potential negative factor being the number of seeds used.Methods: We conducted a sensitivity analysis on estimates produced using data from an RDS study of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) aged >= 16 years living in Vancouver, Canada. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, sexual behavior and substance use. For analysis, we used increasing seed exclusion criteria, starting with all participants and subsequently removing unproductive seeds, chains of <= 1 recruitment waves, and chains of <= 2 recruitment waves. We calculated estimates for three different outcomes (HIV serostatus, condomless anal intercourse with HIV discordant/unknown status partner, and injecting drugs) using three different RDS weighting procedures: RDS-I, RDS-II, and RDS-SS. We also assessed seed dependence with bottleneck analyses and convergence plots. Statistical differences between RDS estimators were assessed through simulation analysis.Results: Overall, 719 participants were recruited, which included 119 seeds and a maximum of 16 recruitment waves (mean chain length = 1.7). The sample of > 0 recruitment waves removed unproductive seeds (n = 50/119, 42.0%), resulting in 69 chains (mean length = 3.0). The sample of > 1 recruitment waves removed 125 seeds or recruits (17.4% of overall sample), resulting in 37 chains (mean length = 4.8). The final sample of > 2 recruitment waves removed a further 182 seeds or recruits (25.3% of overall sample), resulting in 25 chains (mean length = 6.1). Convergence plots and bottleneck analyses of condomless anal intercourse with HIV discordant/unknown status partner and injecting drugs outcomes were satisfactory. For these two outcomes, regardless of seed exclusion criteria used, the crude proportions fell within 95% confidence intervals of all RDS-weighted estimates. Significant differences between the three RDS estimators were not observed.Conclusions: Within a sample of GBMSM in Vancouver, Canada, this RDS study suggests that when equilibrium and homophily are met, although potentially costly and time consuming, analysis is not negatively affected by large numbers of unproductive or lowly productive seeds.",
Do Women Leaders Promote Sustainability? Analyzing the Effect of Corporate Governance Composition on Environmental Performance,BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,Nov 2016,2016,"In this study, we investigate the impact women leaders have on the corporate environmental strategies of organizations. Using a dataset of all Fortune 500 CEOs and boards of directors for a ten-year period, we examine several aspects of gender in leadership on environmental strategy. Specifically, we test the impact of women CEOs, the proportion of women on the BOD, the number of interlinks women board members hold, and the interactive and cumulative effects of women CEOs and gender diverse boards. Findings suggest that firms characterized by gender diverse leadership teams are more effective than other firms at pursuing environmentally friendly strategies. This study contributes to research on corporate governance and environmental performance by showing how the gender composition of leaders affects corporate practice.

Herd behavior in consumers' adoption of online reviews,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Nov 2016,2016,"It has been demonstrated that online consumer reviews are an important source of information that affect individuals' purchase decision making. To understand the influence of online reviews, this study extends prior research on information adoption by incorporating the perspective of herd behavior. We develop and empirically test a research model using data collected from an existing book review site. We report 2 major findings. First, argument quality and source credibility predict information usefulness, which affects the adoption of online reviews. Second, we determine that the adoption of online reviews is also influenced by 2 herd factors, namely, discounting own information and imitating others. We further identify the key determinants of these herd factors, including background homophily and attitude homophily. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",
Dynamic socialized Gaussian process models for human behavior prediction in a health social network,KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Nov 2016,2016,"Modeling and predicting human behaviors, such as the level and intensity of physical activity, is a key to preventing the cascade of obesity and helping spread healthy behaviors in a social network. In our conference paper, we have developed a social influence model, named socialized Gaussian process (SGP), for socialized human behavior modeling. Instead of explicitly modeling social influence as individuals' behaviors influenced by their friends' previous behaviors, SGP models the dynamic social correlation as the result of social influence. The SGP model naturally incorporates personal behavior factor and social correlation factor (i.e., the homophily principle: Friends tend to perform similar behaviors) into a unified model. And it models the social influence factor (i.e., an individual's behavior can be affected by his/her friends) implicitly in dynamic social correlation schemes. The detailed experimental evaluation has shown the SGP model achieves better prediction accuracy compared with most of baseline methods. However, a Socialized Random Forest model may perform better at the beginning compared with the SGP model. One of the main reasons is the dynamic social correlation function is purely based on the users' sequential behaviors without considering other physical activity-related features. To address this issue, we further propose a novel ""multi-feature SGP model"" (mfSGP) which improves the SGP model by using multiple physical activity-related features in the dynamic social correlation learning. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the mfSGP model clearly outperforms all other models in terms of prediction accuracy and running time.",
A simple model of homophily in social networks,EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,Nov 2016,2016,"Biases in meeting opportunities have been recently shown to play a key role for the emergence of homophily in social networks (see Currarini et al., 2009). The aim of this paper is to provide a simple microfoundation of these biases in a model where the size and type-composition of the meeting pools are shaped by agents' socialization decisions. In particular, agents either inbreed (direct search only to similar types) or outbreed (direct search to population at large). When outbreeding is costly, this is shown to induce stark equilibrium behavior of a threshold type: agents ""inbreed"" (i.e. mostly meet their own type) if, and only if, their group is above certain size. We show that this threshold equilibrium generates patterns of in-group and cross-group ties that are consistent with empirical evidence of homophily in two paradigmatic instances: high school friendships and interethnic marriages.

"Identity, homophily and in-group bias",EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,Nov 2016,2016,"Many instances of social interaction display either or both of the following well-documented phenomena. People tend to interact with similar others (homophily). They also tend to treat others of shared social identity more favorably (in-group bias). While both phenomena involve some degree of discrimination towards others, a systematic study of their relations and interplay is yet missing. In this paper we report the findings of an experiment designed to address this issue. Participants are exogenously and randomly assigned to one of two groups. Subsequently they play a sequence of eight games with either an in-group or an out-group member. In treatment EXO in- and out-group matches are formed exogenously, while in ENDO participants can choose between in- and out-group matches. We find strong evidence of in-group bias in EXO, and strong evidence of homophily in ENDO. In-group biases, however, either decrease or disappear altogether under endogenous matching. We show that self-selection of homophilous agents into in-group matches cannot explain this fact. We also find that homophily is strongly correlated with risk aversion, and we build on this evidence to derive a rationale for both the existence of homophily and the disappearance of in-group biases under endogenous matching.

Communication networks of men facing a diagnosis of prostate cancer,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING,Nov 2016,2016,"Aims and objectives. This study seeks to identify the factors that shape the communication networks of men who face a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer, and how these factors relate to their disclosure about their changing health status.Background. Men facing a potential diagnosis of prostate cancer are in a challenging situation; the support benefits of disclosing their changing health status to others in their communication networks is set against a backdrop of the potential stigma and uncertainty of the diagnosis.Design. All men on a prostate biopsy waiting list were eligible for inclusion in an exploratory and interpretive study.Methods. Semi-structured interviews with 40 men explored their network structures and disclosure of health information. Thematic analysis highlighted the factors which contributed to their network structures and their disclosure about their health status.Results. Four network factors shaped men's perspectives about disclosing their health status: (1) tie strength, comprising both strong and weak ties; (2) knowledgeable others, with a focus on medical professionals in the family; (3) homophily, which included other individuals with a similar medical condition; and (4) geographical proximity, with a preference for face-to-face communication.Conclusion. Communication networks influence men's disclosure of their health status and in particular weak ties with medical knowledge have an important role. Men who use the potential for support in their networks may experience improved psychosocial outcomes.Relevance to clinical practice. Using these four network factors-tie strength, knowledgeable others, homophily or geographical proximity-to forecast men's willingness to disclose helps identify men who lack potential support and so are at risk of poor psychosocial health. Those with few strong ties or knowledgeable others in their networks may be in the at-risk cohort. The support provided in communication networks complements formal medical care from nurses and other health professionals, and encouraging patients to use their communication networks improves the psychosocial health of the men themselves, their partners and their families.",
A social network analysis of substance use among immigrant adolescents in six European cities,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Nov 2016,2016,"Background: Social integration and the health of adolescents with a migration background is a major concern in multicultural societies. The literature, however, has paid little attention to the wider determinants of their health behaviours, including the composition of their social networks. The aim of this study was to describe the composition of adolescents' social networks according to migration background, and to examine how social networks are associated with substance use.Method: In 2013, the SILNE study surveyed 11,015 secondary-school adolescents in 50 schools in six European cities in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal, using a social network design. Each adolescent nominated up to five of their best and closest friends. Migration status was defined as first-generation migrants, second-generation migrants, and speaking another language at home. We computed two groups of network structural positions, the centrality of individual adolescents in networks, and the homophily of their social ties regarding migration (same-migration). Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the association between network structural position and smoking, alcohol use, and cannabis use.Results: Compared with non-migrant adolescents, adolescents with migration backgrounds had similar relationship patterns. But almost half their social ties were with same-migration-background adolescents; non-migrants had few social ties to migrants. For adolescents with a migration background, a higher proportion of social ties with non-migrants was associated with increased use of cannabis (OR = 1.07, p = 0.03) and alcohol (OR = 1.08, p < 0.01), but not with increased smoking (p = 0.60). Popular migrant adolescents were at less risk of smoking, alcohol use, and cannabis use than popular non-migrant adolescents.Conclusion: Homophily of social ties by migration background is noticeable in European schools. The tendency of migrant adolescents to have same-migration social ties may isolate them from non-migrant adolescents, but also reduces their risky health behaviours, in particular cannabis and alcohol use.

Look Who's Talking. Explaining Water-Related Information Sharing and Demand for Action Among Ugandan Villagers,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Nov 2016,2016,"Many national water policies propagate community-based participatory approaches to overcome weaknesses in supply-driven rural water provision, operation, and maintenance. Citizen involvement is thought to stimulate bottom-up accountability and broaden the information base, which may enrich design and implementation processes and foster improved water accessibility and sustainability. Practices on the ground, however, are embedded in socio-political realities which mediate possible beneficial effects of participatory approaches. This paper builds on full social network data collected in a Ugandan village to study the social and political reality of two distinct levels of participation, i.e. local information sharing among citizens and a more active appeal to fellow citizens to improve water services. We use Logistic Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure to explore what type of actor and network traits influence information sharing and whether the same factors are in play in the demand for action to remedy water-related problems. Whereas social aspects (social support relations) and homophily (using the same water source, the same gender) play an important role in information sharing, it is the educational level, in particular, of the villager who is called upon that is important when villagers demand action. Our findings also demonstrate that those most in need of safe water do not mobilize their information sharing ties to demand for action. This indicates that building local water policies and practice exclusively on locally existing demand for action may fail to capture the needs of the most deprived citizens.",
HIV Testing Behavior and Social Network Characteristics and Functions Among Young Men Who have Sex with Men (YMSM) in Metropolitan Detroit,AIDS AND BEHAVIOR,Nov 2016,2016,"HIV testing promotion is a critical HIV prevention strategy, especially among at-risk groups such as young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Based on a web survey of 194 YMSM (18-24), we examine the association of social network characteristics and functions, and of individual-level characteristics, with three HIV testing behaviors (ever, repeat, and recent testing). Network homophily was associated with recent testing in multivariable models. The network function of information acquisition was associated with ever testing and repeat testing. Perceived stigma regarding HIV-related help-seeking was negatively related to recent testing. Individual characteristics were associated with testing outcomes in all models; age, perceived behavioral control, and positive attitudes had the greatest influence. Individual characteristics had a stronger association with ever testing and repeat testing than network characteristics and functions; however, this relationship was reversed for recent testing. Findings support the value of multi-level and network-focused interventions for promoting HIV testing among YMSM.",
Ethnic minorities and brothers in arms: competition and homophily in the military,ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES,Nov 2016,2016,"Although the solidarity of brothers in arms is an important feature of the military, when it comes to ethnic minorities there is a pivotal paradox. On the one hand the military aims at drawing boundaries between soldiers and civilians by blurring existing ethnic and racial divisions inside the military. On the other hand the military is a highly national institution which prides itself on conservative values. Can these contradictions work? And how soldiers understand them? This paper examines the construction of ethnic boundaries in inter-group relations by focusing on the tension between ethnic hierarchy and competition versus homophily- the preference for maintaining ties with persons who are similar. Through participant observation and in-depth interviews with Dutch soldiers before and during deployment in Bosnia and Kosovo I ask when each strategy is put into work and why.",
"Homophily, group size, and the diffusion of political information in social networks: Evidence from Twitter",JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,Nov 2016,2016,"We investigate the role of homophily - a tendency to interact with similar individuals-in the diffusion of political information in social networks. We develop a model predicting disproportionate exposure to like-minded information and that larger groups have more connections and are exposed to more information. To test these hypotheses, we use data on links and communications between politically-engaged Twitter users. We find that users affiliated with majority political groups, relative to the minority group, have more connections, are exposed to more information, and are exposed to information more quickly. Likewise, we find that users are disproportionately exposed to like-minded information and that information reaches like-minded users more quickly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
It takes two: A dyadic model of recruitment to civic activity,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Nov 2016,2016,"Why are some people, but not others, asked to engage in civic activity? Rather than focus on the personal traits of either potential recruits or recruiters for this initial stage of recruitment, we develop and test a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of shared relationships and characteristics between those doing the recruiting and those being recruited. Specifically, the nature of interactions, overlapping community and associational space, status and value homophily, and strength and intimacy are assessed to explain differential recruitment among people's closest ties. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, we do so across three different forms of civic activity blood donation, volunteer work, and political activism allowing us to identify larger patterns in civic solicitation. Results from multilevel analyses of dyads reorganized from ego-centric data of U.S. adults show that while certain personal traits of egos and alters remain significant, attributes of the dyad are equally, if not more, consequential for explaining variation in who gets asked to participate in civic activity. Importantly, while certain dyadic characteristics such as romantic partnerships promote recruitment to all three forms of civic activity, the effects of others such as sex homophily are unique to specific forms. Broadly speaking, our results indicate that some types of dyadic characteristics are more powerful than others and that there are important differences in how particular dimensions of social connections shape recruitment efforts across the specific activities of donating blood, volunteering time, and engaging in political activism.

Spatial distance and mobile business social network density,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,Nov 2016,2016,"Following the increasing adoption of mobile communication, scholars have shown interest in the role of place on the structure of mobile social networks. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between spatial distance and the closure and diversity of businesses mobile social networks. We used a database that aggregates actual mobile communication patterns of business users of a large Israeli cell phone company (n=16,199). Our findings, among a large sample of businesses, provide support for the place and mobile communication perspective. The results reveal a negative association between spatial distance and mobile business communication networks. As spatial distance between business network members increases, business social ties through mobile communication decreases. Furthermore, the results also revealed a negative association between spatial distance and mobile network density. As the spatial distance between business users increases, the density of the mobile communication network diminishes. Physical proximity promotes the development of dense business networks. The implications of the findings are discussed.",
Homophily in coauthorship networks of East European sociologists,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Oct 27 2016,2016,"We study to what degree and how homophily and network properties affect individual citation counts of researchers in the sociology departments of three East European countries, namely Poland, Romania, and Slovenia. We built first-order personal coauthorship networks out of the Web of Science publication records. Each sociologist is assigned as a focal node or ego, while her coauthors are alters. We analyze the data using structural measurements methods, hierarchical regression models, and we make visualizations based on the clustered graph technique. For all three populations, our results indicate that the mean score of the citations of alters substantially predicts the citation counts of egos. In particular, citation similarity increases the chances for coauthorship ties. Evidence for the impact of network properties on the citation levels of egos is mixed. For Poland, normalized ego-betweenness shows a negative effect on citation counts, while network density displays a positive one. For Romania and Slovenia, network characteristics have only a minor impact. Even if the visual summarization of the personal networks uncovers a wide palette of coauthorship patterns, homophily appears to be pervasive. These results are relevant for domestic policy makers who aim to improve the aggregated research performance in East European countries.",
"Empirical Models of Social Learning in a Large, Evolving Network",PLOS ONE,Oct 4 2016,2016,"This paper advances theories of social learning through an empirical examination of how social networks change over time. Social networks are important for learning because they constrain individuals' access to information about the behaviors and cognitions of other people. Using data on a large social network of mobile device users over a one-month time period, we test three hypotheses: 1) attraction homophily causes individuals to form ties on the basis of attribute similarity, 2) aversion homophily causes individuals to delete existing ties on the basis of attribute dissimilarity, and 3) social influence causes individuals to adopt the attributes of others they share direct ties with. Statistical models offer varied degrees of support for all three hypotheses and show that these mechanisms are more complex than assumed in prior work. Although homophily is normally thought of as a process of attraction, people also avoid relationships with others who are different. These mechanisms have distinct effects on network structure. While social influence does help explain behavior, people tend to follow global trends more than they follow their friends.",
Predicting Altruistic Behavior and Assessing Homophily: Evidence from the Sisterhood,SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Oct 3 2016,2016,"The persistence of altruism throughout the evolutionary process has been explained by some on the basis of assortation, which requires the ability to detect dispositional altruism in others and voluntary interaction, resulting in altruism homophily. Numerous studies have identified the ability to detect dispositional altruism in strangers, but few have investigated this ability and altruism homophily in social networks. The purpose of this study is to provide additional evidence with regard to the ability to detect dispositional altruism among individuals who have repeated interactions in a collegiate social organization and the extent of altruism homophily. The results indicate that individuals possess an ability to predict dispositional altruism as measured by behavior in the dictator game and that this ability is a function of social closeness. However, the study does not support the hypothesis of an assortation process that results in altruism homophily.",
The Effects of Research Resources on International Collaboration in the Astronomy Community,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Oct 2016,2016,"This study examines whether an institution's research resources affect its centrality and relationships in international collaboration among 606 astronomical institutions worldwide. The findings support our theoretical hypotheses that an institution's research resources are positively related to its central position in the network. Astronomical institutions with superior resources, such as being equipped with international observational facilities and having substantial research manpower, tend to have more foreign partners (high degree centrality) and play an influential role (high betweenness centrality) in the international collaboration network. An institution becomes more and more active in international collaborations as its research population expands. In terms of the relationship, which is captured by an actor institution's co-authorship preference for each partner in the network, the effect of research resources is not as significant as expected. We found that astronomical institutions are not necessarily preferentially co-authoring with partners that have better research resources. In addition, this study indicates that geographic closeness (or ""geographic proximity"") largely affects the occurrence of international collaboration. The investigated institutions apparently prefer partners from neighboring countries. This finding gives an indication of the phenomenon of regional homophily in the international collaboration network.",
Combining evolutionary game theory and network theory to analyze human cooperation patterns,CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS,Oct 2016,2016,"As natural systems continuously evolve, the human cooperation dilemma represents an increasingly more challenging question. Humans cooperate in natural and social systems, but how it happens and what are the mechanisms which rule the emergence of cooperation, represent an open and fascinating issue. In this work, we investigate the evolution of cooperation through the analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of behaviours within the social network, where nodes can choose to cooperate or defect following the classical social dilemmas represented by Prisoner's Dilemma and Snowdrift games. To this aim, we introduce a sociological concept and statistical estimator, ""Critical Mass"", to detect the minimum initial seed of cooperators able to trigger the diffusion process, and the centrality measure to select within the social network. Selecting different spatial configurations of the Critical Mass nodes, we highlight how the emergence of cooperation can be influenced by this spatial choice of the initial core in the network. Moreover, we target to shed light how the concept of homophily, a social shaping factor for which ""birds of a feather flock together"", can affect the evolutionary process. Our findings show that homophily allows speeding up the diffusion process and make quicker the convergence towards human cooperation, while centrality measure and thus the Critical Mass selection, play a key role in the evolution showing how the spatial configurations can create some hidden patterns, partially counterbalancing the impact of homophily.

Homophily and polarization in the age of misinformation,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS,Oct 2016,2016,"The World Economic Forum listed massive digital misinformation as one of the main threats for our society. The spreading of unsubstantiated rumors may have serious consequences on public opinion such as in the case of rumors about Ebola causing disruption to health-care workers. In this work we target Facebook to characterize information consumption patterns of 1.2M Italian users with respect to verified (science news) and unverified (conspiracy news) contents. Through a thorough quantitative analysis we provide important insights about the anatomy of the system across which misinformation might spread. In particular, we show that users' engagement on verified (or unverified) content correlates with the number of friends having similar consumption patterns (homophily). Finally, we measure how this social system responded to the injection of 4, 709 false information. We find that the frequent (and selective) exposure to specific kind of content (polarization) is a good proxy for the detection of homophile clusters where certain kind of rumors are more likely to spread.",
Culture in mediated interaction: Political defriending on Facebook and the limits of networked individualism,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL SOCIOLOGY,Oct 2016,2016,"During the 2014 Gaza war, Facebook became a central arena for moral/political boundary work for Israeli users, resulting in unusually high rates of politically motivated tie dissolution. Cultural criteria were thus applied to restructure and symbolically cleanse social networks. We analyze Facebook's visibility-structures, interview data, and public posts to explore this phenomenon. Studying Facebook interaction reveals cultural mechanisms used offline to sustain heterogeneous social networks and facilitate interaction despite differences - group style differentiation between circles, differential self-presentation, and constructing imagined homogeneity - whose employment is impeded by Facebook's material design. This case of materiality-informed value homophily introduces materiality to the sociological understanding of the interrelations between culture and network structure. Interviewees reported dissolving ties following their shock and surprise at the political views and sacrilegious expression styles of their Facebook friends. We demonstrate that their shock and surprise derived from Facebook's design, which converges life-spheres and social circles and thwarts segregation of interactions, group styles, and information. Rather than disembedding individuals from groups within the 'networked-individualism,' it makes individuals accountable for their statements towards all their social circles. In dramatic times, this collapse of segregation between life-spheres, affiliation circles, and group styles conjures Durkheimian sociability and symbolic cleansing despite commitment to pluralism.",
"Supplier involvement in the fuzzy front end of new product development: An investigation of homophily, benevolence and market turbulence",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS,Oct 2016,2016,"The fuzzy front end (FFE) of new product development (NPD), i.e. the phase preceding the formal product development, is characterized by ill-defined processes, ad-hoc decisions, equivocality and uncertainty. While involving suppliers in this early stage is crucial, limited insight exists on how to best accomplish this objective. We address this issue in the present research by focusing on two important characteristics of the buyer-supplier relationship: homophily and benevolence. Grounding our arguments in social exchange theory (SET), both dimensions are expected to be associated with a greater degree of supplier involvement. In addition, taking a contingency perspective, arguments are developed for the moderating role of market turbulence. These contentions are tested with project-level NPD data. The data provide support for the association of homophily with supplier involvement in the FFE, highlighting the relevance to consider ""softer"" supplier selection criteria for NPD success. While the link between benevolence and supplier involvement in the FFE was not supported, both moderation hypotheses were, providing insight into the dynamics underlying supplier involvement in the FFE of NPD. Overall, we advance theory by examining antecedents and contingencies that can foster supplier involvement in the FFE, an area left largely uninvestigated to date, and provide practical guidance for supply chain managers on how the involvement of suppliers in the FFE phase can be enhanced.

Dead Languages as an Profitable Investment?,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE,Oct 2016,2016,"How does the selection of a classical language at school affect prospects on the labor market? Even though research on the impact of horizontal educational inequalities on labor market outcomes has become prominent recently, this question has not yet attracted scholarly attention. Based on several differing approaches (Human Capital Theory, Signaling Theory, Homophily Principle), hypotheses are derived about the impact of the language profile at school on labor market prospects at career entry. To test these assumptions, a field experiment was conducted in which applications were submitted in response to job advertisements. Results show that choosing Latin and Ancient Greek has a positive impact on the chances of being invited to a job interview.",
Biological mechanisms underlying evolutionary origins of psychotic and mood disorders,NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH,Oct 2016,2016,"Psychotic and mood disorders are brain dysfunctions that are caused by gene environment interactions. Although these disorders are disadvantageous and involve behavioral phenotypes that decrease the reproductive success of afflicted individuals in the modern human society, the prevalence of these disorders have remained constant in the population. Here, we propose several biological mechanisms by which the genes associated with psychotic and mood disorders could be selected for in specific environmental conditions that provide evolutionary bases for explanations of when, why, and where these disorders emerged and have been maintained in humans. We discuss the evolutionary origins of psychotic and mood disorders with specific focuses on the roles of dopamine and serotonin in the conditions of social competitiveness/hierarchy and maternal care and other potential mechanisms, such as social network homophily and symbiosis.

"Making ""Friends"" in a Virtual World: The Role of Preferential Attachment, Homophily, and Status",SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW,Oct 2016,2016,"Graphical virtual worlds add two new layers to the old question what determines friendship formation. First, it is possible to distinguish between off-line (player) and online (avatar) characteristics. Second, these environments offer new possibilities for studying friendship formation. By tracking friendship requests and their acceptance rate, researchers are able to distinguish between with whom players want to become friends and with whom they actually do become friends. This article examined friendship formation in Timik, a graphical virtual world targeted at Polish teenagers. Homophily, preferential attachment and status were tested as possible underlying mechanisms. Results showed that preferential attachment and status drove invitations: Players wanted to become friends with high-status players. However, high-status players were also more likely to reject offers. Homophily only played a minor role. Players preferred players of the same avatar class and similar age but of the opposite sex. Too similar avatars were disliked. The results are discussed in the light of the generalizability of off-line theories of friendship formation to online worlds.",
Attitudes towards reforming primary care in Belgium: social network analysis in a pluralist context,JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH & POLICY,Oct 2016,2016,"Objectives Health care policies are influenced by many groups which in turn influence each other. Our aim was to describe a network of nominated influential stakeholders and analyze how it affects attitudes to reforming primary care.Methods Face-to-face interviews were carried out in Belgium with 102 influential people. Each respondent was asked to score solutions for improving the role of general practice in the health care system and to nominate up to six other influential stakeholders. Social network and multivariate analyses were used to describe the nomination network and its effect on attitudes to reform.Results The network was highly centralized and homophilous (tendency to bond with people who are similar) for language groups. Despite Belgium having a strong pluralist tradition of decision making, policy makers were central to the network (average indegree=10.8) compared to professional representatives (6.9). Respondents supported an enhanced role for general practitioners but did not support radically new policies.Conclusion Social network analysis contributes to understanding why health care reforms may languish in pluralistic, decentralized health care systems. The central position of a stakeholder in a network is related to perceived influence but does not favour a radical policy orientation. In addition, language-group homophily in the perceived influence network' leads to a weak coalition that only favours small-step reform.",
"Follower-Followee Network, Communication Networks, and Vote Agreement of the US Members of Congress",COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,Oct 2016,2016,"The digital traces of U.S. members of congress on Twitter enable researchers to observe how these public officials interact with one another in a direct and unobtrusive manner. Using data from Twitter and other sources (e.g., roll-call vote data), this study aims to examine how members of congress connect and communicate with one another on Twitter, why they will connect and communicate with one another in such a way, and what effects such connection and communication among members of congress have on their floor vote behavior. The follower-followee and communication networks of members of congress on Twitter demonstrate a high degree of partisan homogeneity. Members of congress prefer to follow or communicate with other members who are similar to them in terms of partisanship, home state, chamber, and public concern. This condition is known as the homophily effect in social network research. However, the magnitude of the homophily effect is mitigated when the effects of endogenous networking mechanisms (i.e., reciprocity and triadic closure) in such networks are controlled. Follower-followee ties can facilitate political discourse among members of congress on Twitter, whereas both follower-followee and communication ties on Twitter increase the likelihood of vote agreement among members of congress. The theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of the findings are addressed.",

"Friends, Cognition, and Delinquency: Proactive and Reactive Criminal Thinking as Mediators of the Peer Influence and Peer Selection Effects among Male Delinquents",JUSTICE QUARTERLY,Oct 2016,2016,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether criminal thinking underpins peer influence and selection. It was predicted that proactive criminal thinking would mediate the peer influence effect (peersoffending) and reactive criminal thinking would mediate the peer selection effect (offendingpeers). Participants were 1,170 male delinquent youth from the Pathways to Desistance study. The Moral Disengagement scale (proactive criminal thinking) and Peer Delinquent Behavior scale (peer delinquency) were cross-lagged to predict criminal offending, and the Weinberger Impulse Control scale (reactive criminal thinking) and criminal offending were cross-lagged to predict peer delinquency. Consistent with predictions, proactive but not reactive criminal thinking successfully mediated the peeroffending relationship and reactive but not proactive criminal thinking successfully mediated the offendingpeer relationship. Whereas delinquent peer associations appear to promote proactive criminal thinking and peer influence, early criminal offending appears to promote reactive criminal thinking and peer selection.",
Snowball sampling for estimating exponential random graph models for large networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2016,2016,"The exponential random graph model (ERGM) is a well-established statistical approach to modelling social network data. However, Monte Carlo estimation of ERGM parameters is a computationally intensive procedure that imposes severe limits on the size of full networks that can be fitted. We demonstrate the use of snowball sampling and conditional estimation to estimate ERGM parameters for large networks, with the specific goal of studying the validity of inference about the presence of such effects as network closure and attribute homophily. We estimate parameters for snowball samples from the network in parallel, and combine the estimates with a meta-analysis procedure. We assess the accuracy of this method by applying it to simulated networks with known parameters, and also demonstrate its application to networks that are too large (over 40000 nodes) to estimate social circuit and other more advanced ERGM specifications directly. We conclude that this approach offers reliable inference for closure and homophily. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Beyond Risk Compensation: Clusters of Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) Users in Sexual Networks Can Modify the Impact of ART on HIV Incidence,PLOS ONE,Sep 22 2016,2016,"IntroductionConcerns about risk compensation-increased risk behaviours in response to a perception of reduced HIV transmission risk-after the initiation of ART have largely been dispelled in empirical studies, but other changes in sexual networking patterns may still modify the effects of ART on HIV incidence.MethodsWe developed an exploratory mathematical model of HIV transmission that incorporates the possibility of ART clusters, i.e. subsets of the sexual network in which the density of ART patients is much higher than in the rest of the network. Such clusters may emerge as a result of ART homophily-a tendency for ART patients to preferentially form and maintain relationships with other ART patients. We assessed whether ART clusters may affect the impact of ART on HIV incidence, and how the influence of this effect-modifying variable depends on contextual variables such as HIV prevalence, HIV serosorting, coverage of HIV testing and ART, and adherence to ART.ResultsART homophily can modify the impact of ART on HIV incidence in both directions. In concentrated epidemics and generalized epidemics with moderate HIV prevalence (approximate to 10%), ART clusters can enhance the impact of ART on HIV incidence, especially when adherence to ART is poor. In hyperendemic settings (approximate to 35% HIV prevalence), ART clusters can reduce the impact of ART on HIV incidence when adherence to ART is high but few people living with HIV (PLWH) have been diagnosed. In all contexts, the effects of ART clusters on HIV epidemic dynamics are distinct from those of HIV serosorting.ConclusionsDepending on the programmatic and epidemiological context, ART clusters may enhance or reduce the impact of ART on HIV incidence, in contrast to serosorting, which always leads to a lower impact of ART on HIV incidence. ART homophily and the emergence of ART clusters should be measured empirically and incorporated into more refined models used to plan and evaluate ART programmes.",
Social networks in the Little Scrub Island ground lizard (Ameiva corax),JOURNAL OF ETHOLOGY,Sep 2016,2016,"Ameiva corax is a diurnal, widely foraging lizard endemic to a small (<2 ha) Caribbean island and is known for social foraging, whereby individuals aggregate at large food items (e.g., bird eggs and cactus fruits). We characterized the social network for A. corax through focal observations and surveys, which delineated associations for 82 known individuals. Lizards varied greatly in the extent to which they were linked to the social network. Approximately 31 % of individuals were not observed in any associations while one individual associated with 22 % (n = 18) of the animals in the study area. Larger lizards tended to be more central to the social network; body size was positively correlated with number of associations (degree) and centrality (betweenness), but negatively correlated with average distance between an individual and its associates (mean path length). Larger individuals were also associated with lower clustering coefficients, indicating that their associates were less closely interconnected. Sex was not related to number of associations (degree), but did help explain some patterns. The extent to which a lizard's associates were of the same sex (homophily) was related to both sex and body size. Females had lower homophily scores than males; within each sex larger lizards tended to have lower homophily.",
An Illustration of the Relational Event Model to Analyze Group Interaction Processes,GROUP DYNAMICS-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,Sep 2016,2016,"A fundamental assumption in the study of groups is that they are constituted by various interaction processes that are critical to survival, success, and failure. However, there are few methods available sophisticated enough to empirically analyze group interaction. To address this issue, we present an illustration of relational event modeling (REM). A relational event is a ""discrete event generated by a social actor and directed toward 1 or more targets"" (Butts, 2008, p. 159). Because REM provides a procedure to model relational event histories, it has the ability to figure out which patterns of group interaction are more or less common than others. For instance, do past patterns of interaction influence future interactions, (e.g., reciprocity), do individual attributes make it more likely that individuals will create interactions (e.g., homophily), and do specific contextual factors influence interaction patterns (e.g.,complexity of a task)? The current paper provides an REM tutorial from a multiteam system experiment in which 2 teams navigated a terrain to coordinate their movement to arrive at a common destination point. We use REM to model the dominant patterns of interactions, which included the principle of inertia (i.e., past contacts tended to be future contacts) and trust (i.e., group members interacted with members they trusted more) in the current example. An online appendix that includes the example data set and source code is available as supplemental material in order to demonstrate the utility REM, which mainly lies in its ability to model rich, time-stamped trace data without severely simplifying it (e.g.,aggregating interactions into a panel).",
Choosing peers: Homophily and polarization in groups,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY,Sep 2016,2016,"This paper studies the formation of peer groups entailing the joint production of public goods. In our model agents choose their peers and have to pay a connection cost for each member added to the group. After groups are formed, each agent selects a public project to make a costly contribution to, and all members of the group experience the benefits of these contributions. Since agents differ in how much they value one project relative to the other, the group's preferences affect the generated profile of public goods. We characterize mutually optimal groups, groups that are optimal for all their members. When contribution costs are low relative to connection costs, mutually optimal groups must be sufficiently homogeneous. As contribution costs increase relative to connection costs, agents desire more connections, which in turn raises the risk of free riding. Extreme peers are then more appealing, since they are more willing to contribute, and polarization arises. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Evolution through bursts: Network structure develops through localized bursts in time and space,NETWORK SCIENCE,Sep 2016,2016,"Models of network evolution are based on the implicit assumption that network growth is continuous, uniform, and steady. Using the data collected from a large online-blogging platform, we show that the addition and removal of network ties by users do not occur sporadically at isolated nodes spread all over the network, as assumed by the vast majority of stochastic network models, but rather occur in brief bursts of intense local activity.These bursts of network growth and attrition (addition and removal of network ties) are highly localized around focal nodes. Such network changes coincide with nearly instantaneous densification of the ties between the affected nodes, resulting in an increase of local clustering. Furthermore, we find that these network changes are tightly coupled to the dynamics of individual attributes, particularly the increase in homology between neighboring nodes (homophily) within the scope of the burst. Coincidence of the localized network change with the increase in homophily suggests a strong coupling between the selection and influence processes that lead to simultaneous elevation of assortativity and clustering.",
Friendship networks and sun safety behavior among children,NETWORK SCIENCE,Sep 2016,2016,"Social networks, particularly those defined by friendships, influence many childhood and adolescent health behaviors such as the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, as well as diet and physical activity. Few, if any, studies have examined the concordance between friendship networks and sun exposure/safety behaviors. This study examines the friendship networks and sun safety behaviors for a group of fourth and fifth grade students taking part in a larger sun safety intervention, ""SunSmart"" (n = 128). Intra-class correlation, homophily hypothesis testing, and exponential random graph models were used to test friendship homophily based on sun safety behaviors. Peer Leaders were identified through social network popularity, and sun safety change scores were compared between Peer Leaders and non-leaders. Results show that students cluster based on shared demographic characteristics and some sun safety behaviors, and that there was a trend for Peer Leaders to respond better to the SunSmart intervention than non-leaders. Implications for future sun safety interventions using Peer Leaders as champions for sun safety behavior change are discussed.",
With a little help from my friends: An analysis of the role of social support in digital inequalities,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Sep 2016,2016,"This article reports an empirical study on the composition and socio-economic background of social support networks and their moderating role in explaining digital inequalities. It conceptually draws upon and empirically reaffirms Van Dijk's multiple access model, acknowledging motivational, material, skill and usage divides, while focussing on the under-researched issue of social support as indispensible source of social learning. Besides a small group of self-reliants, the results indicate a pattern of relatively socially disadvantaged domestic support receivers, characterized by lower digital resources. A second social support pattern points to a relatively socially advantaged non-domestic support receivers (i.e. friends/colleagues), high in digital resources. Drawing upon the concept of homophily in social networks, the results indicate a link between offline and online exclusion, perpetuating digital inequalities.",
A Comparative Perspective on Mothers' Ethnic Homophily Among Minority Groups in Germany and Israel,JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY,Sep 2016,2016,"Despite beneficial effects of minority members' contact with majority members, studies have repeatedly shown minorities' tendency of having predominantly intraethnic social contacts, a phenomenon called ethnic homophily. This study aimed at examining ethnic homophily among mothers belonging to minority groups in Germany and Israel. Mothers from four minority groups participated. Groups were defined by level of societal segregation (higher vs. lower residential and cultural segregation of minority groups within a given society) and cultural distance to the majority society (close vs. distant in terms of religion and value similarity with majority population). We expected group differences, with ethnic homophily being highest among minority mothers living in more segregated societies with a large cultural distance to the majority population and vice versa. We also expected within-group variation, with higher levels of homophily being reported by women who use the majority language less frequently, have lower orientations toward natives, have higher orientations toward their own minority, and perceive higher levels of discrimination. The total sample included 1,223 mothers (ethnic German diaspora repatriates and Turks in Germany, Russian Jewish diaspora migrants, and Arabs in Israel). We assessed homophily in strong and weak social network ties. Results revealed the highest homophily (for weak and strong ties) among Israeli Arab mothers and lowest among ethnic German diaspora repatriate mothers with the two other groups located in between the two. Use of majority language emerged as rather universal predictor related to both outcomes in all minority groups, whereas minority and majority orientations were outcome or group specific, respectively.",
Friendship network in the classroom: Parents bias on peer effects,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,Sep 2016,2016,"We interview both parents and their children enrolled in six primary schools in the district of Treviso (Italy). We study the structural differences between the children network of friends reported by children and the one elicited asking their parents. We find that the parent-reported network has a bias that is consistent with the following explanation: parents expect peer effects on school achievement to be stronger than what they really are. Thus, parents of low-performing students report their children to be friends of high performing students. Our numerical simulations indicate that when this bias is combined with a bias on how some children target friends, then there is a multiplier effect on the expected school achievement.

Emergence of metapopulations and echo chambers in mobile agents,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Aug 30 2016,2016,"Multi-agent models often describe populations segregated either in the physical space, i.e. subdivided in metapopulations, or in the ecology of opinions, i.e. partitioned in echo chambers. Here we show how both kinds of segregation can emerge from the interplay between homophily and social influence in a simple model of mobile agents endowed with a continuous opinion variable. In the model, physical proximity determines a progressive convergence of opinions but differing opinions result in agents moving away from each others. This feedback between mobility and social dynamics determines the onset of a stable dynamical metapopulation scenario where physically separated groups of like-minded individuals interact with each other through the exchange of agents. The further introduction of confirmation bias in social interactions, defined as the tendency of an individual to favor opinions that match his own, leads to the emergence of echo chambers where different opinions coexist also within the same group. We believe that the model may be of interest to researchers investigating the origin of segregation in the offline and online world.",
A Dominant Social Comparison Heuristic Unites Alternative Mechanisms for the Evolution of Indirect Reciprocity,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Aug 12 2016,2016,"Cooperation is a fundamental human trait but our understanding of how it functions remains incomplete. Indirect reciprocity is a particular case in point, where one-shot donations are made to unrelated beneficiaries without any guarantee of payback. Existing insights are largely from two independent perspectives: i) individual-level cognitive behaviour in decision making, and ii) identification of conditions that favour evolution of cooperation. We identify a fundamental connection between these two areas by examining social comparison as a means through which indirect reciprocity can evolve. Social comparison is well established as an inherent human disposition through which humans navigate the social world by self-referential evaluation of others. Donating to those that are at least as reputable as oneself emerges as a dominant heuristic, which represents aspirational homophily. This heuristic is found to be implicitly present in the current knowledge of conditions that favour indirect reciprocity. The effective social norms for updating reputation are also observed to support this heuristic. We hypothesise that the cognitive challenge associated with social comparison has contributed to cerebral expansion and the disproportionate human brain size, consistent with the social complexity hypothesis. The findings have relevance for the evolution of autonomous systems that are characterised by one-shot interactions.",
"The strengths of close ties: Taiwanese online entrepreneurship, gender and intersectionality",INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,Aug 2 2016,2016,"This article examines entrepreneurs who have started innovative Internet and mobile technology companies in Taiwan because they are at the forefront of industrial changes in the country. Similar to findings in Europe and the USA, education and careers in technology in Taiwan remain dominated by men. However, I argue that the gender inequality of the sector is partly the result of the fact that small new enterprises rely on family support and close social networks. Few women are able to join the sector with male friends and colleagues due to the close social ties of the founding teams (homophily). Among my female interviewees, half have started their nascent companies with their husbands and male partners (husband and wife teams). However, gender, family backgrounds and childcare responsibilities affect both men and women, and the interviewees in my study were open in discussing these personal factors in relation to being entrepreneurs. This article argues that starting an Internet company is a family decision, discussed within the household. Intersectionality, not only gender, explains the founders' decision to start a company, and their choice of co-founders.",
Interaction patterns and political discussion groups in personal networks of Colombians youths,AMERICA LATINA HOY-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES,Aug 2016,2016,"Structural analysis is applied in this research to evaluate the sociopolitical personal networks of 51 Colombians youths linked to student organizations at university level. Networks are cohesive, showing high levels of density (.53) and transitivity (. 78), includes 4 clusters on average, are formed by friends (81%) and in a lesser degree by relatives (13%). Homophily based on sex, age and educative level seem to play a key role in shaping networks structure.",
"Sexual Behavior Varies Between Same-Race and Different-Race Partnerships: A Daily Diary Study of Highly Sexually Active Black, Latino, and White Gay and Bisexual Men",ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR,Aug 2016,2016,"Racial homophily (partnering with those of the same race) has been suggested as contributing to racial disparities in HIV among gay and bisexual men (GBM). Using a daily diary study, we examined racial homophily and its role in anal sexual behaviors in a sample of highly sexually active Black, White, and Latino GBM (N= 294, n= 3107 sexual events). In general, (1) men tended to partner with others of the same race, (2) HIV was more prevalent among men of color, and (3) race acted independent of whether one would engage in behaviors that would put them at highest risk for transmitting HIV (i.e., no main or interaction effects for insertive condomless anal sex (CAS) among HIV-positive men, and no main or interaction effects for receptive CAS among HIV negative men). There were some main and interactive effects observed for lower risk behaviors (receptive CAS among HIV positive men and insertive CAS among HIV-negative). Our findings suggest that racial disparities in HIV may be due to a higher exposure frequency (i.e., the frequency with which one comes into contact with a partner where a transmission could occur). However, men were also less likely to have anal sex when having sex with someone of the same race a finding that works against the premise of higher exposure frequency. Future researchers should examine both racial homophily as well as variation in sexual behavior based on same -race or different -race partnerships.",
VIOLENT OFFENDING AND VICTIMIZATION IN ADOLESCENCE: SOCIAL NETWORK MECHANISMS AND HOMOPHILY,CRIMINOLOGY,Aug 2016,2016,"Although violent offending and victimization share many features, they can affect adolescent social relationships in distinct ways. To understand these differences, we take a network approach to examine the mechanisms responsible for similarities (i.e., homophily) in violent offending and violent victimization among friends. Our goal is to determine whether the social network mechanisms that produce homophily for violent offending are similar to or different from those that produce homophily for violent victimization. By using stochastic actor-oriented modeling and two waves of friendship network data for 1,948 respondents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we examine homophily mechanisms of preference for similarity, avoidance, and influence with respect to youth violence and victimization. The results demonstrate that homophily observed for violent offending primarily reflects selection of similar others, whereas homophily observed for victimization reflects the tendency among alters to avoid victimized youth. These findings have important implications for future research and suggest that, among adolescents, violent offending and victimization homophily are the result of unique social processes.",
"Birds of a Feather: Social Bases of Neighborhood Formation in Newark, New Jersey, 1880",DEMOGRAPHY,Aug 2016,2016,"This study examines the bases of residential segregation in a late nineteenth century American city, recognizing the strong tendency toward homophily within neighborhoods. Our primary question is how ethnicity, social class, nativity, and family composition affect where people live. Segregation is usually studied one dimension at a time, but these social differences are interrelated, and thus a multivariate approach is needed to understand their effects. We find that ethnicity is the main basis of local residential sorting, while occupational standing and, to a lesser degree, family life cycle and nativity also are significant. A second concern is the geographic scale of neighborhoods: in this study, the geographic area within which the characteristics of potential neighbors matter in locational outcomes of individuals. Studies of segregation typically use a single spatial scale, often one determined by the availability of administrative data. We take advantage of a unique data set containing the address and geo-referenced location of every resident. We conclude that it is the most local scale that offers the best prediction of people's similarity to their neighbors. Adding information at larger scales minimally improves prediction of the person's location. The 1880 neighborhoods of Newark, New Jersey, were formed as individuals located themselves among similar neighbors on a single street segment.",
Valence-based homophily on Twitter: Network Analysis of Emotions and Political Talk in the 2012 Presidential Election,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Aug 2016,2016,"This study integrates network and content analyses to examine valence-based homophily on Twitter or the tendency for individuals to interact with those expressing similar valence. During the 2012 federal election cycle, we collected Twitter conversations about 10 controversial political topics and mapped their network ties. Using network analysis, we discovered clusterssubgroups of highly self-connected usersand coded messages in each cluster for their expressed positive-to-negative emotional valence, level of support or opposition, and political leaning. We found that valence-based homophily successfully explained the selection of user interactions on Twitter, in terms of expressed emotional valence in their tweets or support versus criticism to an issue. It also finds conservative voices to be associated with negatively valenced clusters and vice versa. This study expands the theory of homophily beyond its traditional conceptualization and provides a new understanding of political-issue interactions in a social media context.",
Trust Thy Crooked Neighbor: Multiplexity in Chicago Organized Crime Networks,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Aug 2016,2016,"Bureaucratic and patrimonial theories of organized crime tend to miss the history and mobility of crime groups integrating into and organizing with legitimate society. The network property of multiplexitywhen more than one type of relationship exists between a pair of actorsoffers a theoretical and empirical inroad to analyzing overlapping relationships of seemingly disparate social spheres. Using the historical case of organized crime in Chicago and a unique relational database coded from more than 5,000 pages of archival documents, we map the web of multiplex relationships among bootleggers, politicians, union members, businessmen, families, and friends. We analyze the overlap of criminal, personal, and legitimate networks containing 1,030 individuals and 3,726 mutual dyads between them. Multiplexity is rare in these data: only 10 percent of the mutual dyads contain multiplex ties. However, results from bivariate exponential random graph models demonstrate that multiplexity is a relevant structural property binding the three networks together. Even among our sample of criminals, we find dependencies between the criminal and personal networks and the criminal and legitimate networks. Although not pervasive, multiplexity glued these worlds of organized crime together above and beyond the personalities of famous gangsters, ethnic homophily, and other endogenous network processes.",
Segregation in Civic Life: Ethnic Sorting and Mixing across Voluntary Associations,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Aug 2016,2016,"To what extent do voluntary organizations like sports, leisure, and neighborhood associations provide a platform where ethnic groups mingle and ethnic boundaries are overcome? This study uses unique panel data from the Netherlands Longitudinal Life Course Study (NELLS) to shed light on the integrative power of voluntary associations. I investigate decisions to join and leave associations of different ethnic composition, as a member or a volunteer, among individuals of Turkish, Moroccan, and native Dutch origin. In general, all ethnic groups are equally likely to join voluntary organizations, but ethnic minorities are more likely to leave than are Dutch natives, even after accounting for relevant sociodemographic characteristics. This alone explains ethnic minorities' lower involvement rates. Moreover, joining decisions are characterized by strong ethnic sorting across organizations of different ethnic composition: people are much more likely to join associations containing fewer ethnic out-group members. This limits the potential of voluntary associations as pathways to social integration. In contrast, once the initial hurdle of getting involved has been taken, people are no more likely to disengage from organizations with more ethnic out-group members. Inter-ethnic neighborhood contact and the local supply of involvement opportunities are most influential in explaining the strong sorting tendencies in people's joining decisions.",
A network model characterized by a latent attribute structure with competition,INFORMATION SCIENCES,Aug 1 2016,2016,"The quest for a model that is able to explain, describe, analyze and simulate real-world complex networks is of uttermost practical, as well as theoretical, interest. In fact, networks can be a natural way to represent many phenomena; often, they arise from a complex interweaving of some features of the nodes. For example, in a co-authorship network, a link stems more easily between authors with similar interests; similarly, in a genetic regulatory network, links are affected by the different biological functions of the regulators. In this paper we introduce and study a novel network model that is based on a latent attribute structure: this model, inspired by a generalization of the Indian Buffet process, is simple and contains a small number of parameters, with a clear and intuitive role. Each node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of the existence of an edge between two nodes depends on the features they share; the number of possible features is not fixed a priori and can grow indefinitely. Moreover, a random fitness parameter is introduced for each node in order to determine its ability to transmit its own features to other nodes; this behavior is added on top of a process of Indian-Buffet type. Because of the fitness property, a node's connectivity does not depend on its age alone, so that also ""young but fit"" nodes are able to compete and succeed in propagating their features and acquiring links. We also show how, considering the resulting bipartite node-attribute network, it is possible to gain some insight about which nodes were originally the most ""fit"".Our model for this bipartite network depends on few parameters, that are characterized by their straightforward interpretation and by the availability of proper estimators. Even if the parameters are easy to interpret and tune, the model is general enough to represent complex phenomena-e.g., homophily, heterophily, or any interplay between features. We provide some theoretical as well as experimental results regarding the power-law behavior of the model and the proposed tools for the estimation of the parameters. We also show, through a number of experiments, how the proposed model naturally captures most local and global properties (e.g., degree distributions, connectivity and distance distributions) real networks exhibit.

Extended inclusive fitness theory: synergy and assortment drives the evolutionary dynamics in biology and economics,SPRINGERPLUS,Jul 15 2016,2016,"W.D. Hamilton's Inclusive Fitness Theory explains the conditions that favor the emergence and maintenance of social cooperation. Today we know that these include direct and indirect benefits an agent obtains by its actions, and through interactions with kin and with genetically unrelated individuals. That is, in addition to kin-selection, assortation or homophily, and social synergies drive the evolution of cooperation. An Extended Inclusive Fitness Theory (EIFT) synthesizes the natural selection forces acting on biological evolution and on human economic interactions by assuming that natural selection driven by inclusive fitness produces agents with utility functions that exploit assortation and synergistic opportunities. This formulation allows to estimate sustainable cost/benefit threshold ratios of cooperation among organisms and/or economic agents, using existent analytical tools, illuminating our understanding of the dynamic nature of society, the evolution of cooperation among kin and non-kin, inter-specific cooperation, co-evolution, symbioses, division of labor and social synergies. EIFT helps to promote an interdisciplinary cross fertilization of the understanding of synergy by, for example, allowing to describe the role for division of labor in the emergence of social synergies, providing an integrated framework for the study of both, biological evolution of social behavior and economic market dynamics. Another example is a bio-economic understanding of the motivations of terrorists, which identifies different forms of terrorism.",
Estimating peer effects in networks with peer encouragement designs,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jul 5 2016,2016,"Peer effects, in which the behavior of an individual is affected by the behavior of their peers, are central to social science. Because peer effects are often confounded with homophily and common external causes, recent work has used randomized experiments to estimate effects of specific peer behaviors. These experiments have often relied on the experimenter being able to randomly modulate mechanisms by which peer behavior is transmitted to a focal individual. We describe experimental designs that instead randomly assign individuals' peers to encouragements to behaviors that directly affect those individuals. We illustrate this method with a large peer encouragement design on Facebook for estimating the effects of receiving feedback from peers on posts shared by focal individuals. We find evidence for substantial effects of receiving marginal feedback on multiple behaviors, including giving feedback to others and continued posting. These findings provide experimental evidence for the role of behaviors directed at specific individuals in the adoption and continued use of communication technologies. In comparison, observational estimates differ substantially, both underestimating and overestimating effects, suggesting that researchers and policy makers should be cautious in relying on them.",
Creativity and social alienation: the costs of being creative,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT,Jul 3 2016,2016,"Although creativity is a widely praised merit, the psychological costs that an employee may pay for being creative are less examined. The present study advances the research paradigm on the dark side of creativity by focusing on the negative psychological state (social alienation) of creative employees. By building on the studies on the homophily principle and on the cultural perspective of creativity, we investigated why creative employees are more likely to experience social alienation. Drawing on the social capital theory, we point out that social alienation of creative employees depends on their networking ability and harmony enhancement motive. A two-wave survey among 311 employees from 59 Chinese organizations supported the hypotheses. Implications of the findings are discussed for creativity and alienation literature as well as management practice.",
"Techno-optimism or Information Imperialism: Paradoxes in Online Networking, Social Media and Development",INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT,Jul 2016,2016,"In recent years, the world of social media and online networking has met with the world of international development, leading to rapid changes in development practice and to the emergence of new fields of study. Proponents of this change argue that the Internet provides the tools for global cooperation and participation. However, the reality is less clear, with critics asserting that much of the Information and Communication Technology and networking discourse and practice is rooted in past approaches to development. This reflects a wider debate about whether ICT provides space for alternative views and social movements, or if it represents a new form of networked information colonialism. Drawing on ethnographic research with the online development-oriented network projecthonduras.com, this paper reflects on these debates, and on the wider implications of social media in development practice. An early model of peer-to-peer collaboration in development, projecthonduras.com has over a decade of networking experience and has been the catalyst for many connections and encounters, which have, at times, literally saved lives. However, while research with this network highlights some potential for disintermediated and inclusive networking, it also provides an example of a conventional development approach operating within an online space, and illustrates the impact of digital exclusion and homophily. Using the networking concepts of disintermediation, participation and diversity/homophily, this paper explores the structure and discourse of projecthonduras.com and illustrates the paradoxical nature of ICT and social media in development, providing a cautionary note to those who look to social media to provide answers to contemporary development dilemmas.",
Hyperlinks as Institutionalized Connective Public Goods for Collective Action Online,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Jul 2016,2016,"Nongovernmental organization (NGO) hyperlink networks are institutionalized connective public goods. They influence which actors and what aspects of social issues are made visible to the public in search engine results. To understand how contextual forces and institutional pressures influence who hyperlinks to whom online, this research examines a hyperlink network of 410 NGOs with various social missions operating across China. It suggests that institutional factors external to the network impact the structure of NGO hyperlink networks. In particular, institutional convener and legal registration status induce homophily hyperlinking effects among organizations, controlling for network interdependencies and other organizational attributes. Implications for hyperlink networks, institutional homophily, NGO collective action, and the development of civil society in China are drawn from the results.",
Fishing Nets between Two Seas: Guilds and Ship-Owner Associations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Fishing Grounds of Andalusia,REVISTA ESPANOLA DE INVESTIGACIONES SOCIOLOGICAS,JUL-SEP 2016,2016,"This study examines the organizational network of the extractive sector in Andalusian fishing enclaves. For this, we have evaluated 6 types of informal and institutional relationships between a total of 30 guilds and ship-owner associations in 21 Andalusian fishing ports. The analyzed networks were found to have a core-periphery structure with the guilds playing a central role. The QAP procedure was used to identify two distinct contexts of relationship formation: informal meetings and the government fishing network (corresponding to formal meetings, such as fishing tables, port assemblies and fishing quota negotiations). We verified the existence of significant homophily dynamics based on both fishing ground and organization type.",
Of Echo Chambers and Contrarian Clubs: Exposure to Political Disagreement Among German and Italian Users of Twitter,SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY,JUL-SEP 2016,2016,"Scholars have debated whether social media platforms, by allowing users to select the information to which they are exposed, may lead people to isolate themselves from viewpoints with which they disagree, thereby serving as political ""echo chambers."" We investigate hypotheses concerning the circumstances under which Twitter users who communicate about elections would engage with (a) supportive, (b) oppositional, and (c) mixed political networks. Based on online surveys of representative samples of Italian and German individuals who posted at least one Twitter message about elections in 2013, we find substantial differences in the extent to which social media facilitates exposure to similar versus dissimilar political views. Our results suggest that exposure to supportive, oppositional, or mixed political networks on social media can be explained by broader patterns of political conversation (i.e., structure of offline networks) and specific habits in the political use of social media (i.e., the intensity of political discussion). These findings suggest that disagreement persists on social media even when ideological homophily is the modal outcome, and that scholars should pay more attention to specific situational and dispositional factors when evaluating the implications of social media for political communication.",
Not all emotions are created equal: Expressive behavior of the networked public on China's social media site,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jul 2016,2016,"This study attempts to investigate the online expressive behavior of social media users in China. Specifically, we combine machine learning-based textual analysis with social network analysis to examine the structure and content of the discussion network which formed around the political aspects of food safety issues on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The findings suggest that Weibo-mediated communication space does not serve as an effective forum for deliberative discussion because people of like mind tend to cluster and the factor of emotion predominates. Further statistical analyses of a hand-coded sample show that emotional discussions influence people more than cognitive discussions, with distinct emotions (e.g., anger, fear and sadness) having different effects. A poster's status is also found to matter. We contend that this kind of online civic talk underlines an expressive form of rationality that transcends the dominant bipolar instrumental-communicative dimension for understanding the use of social media in online political discussion.

"Managing consumer debt: Culture, compliance, and completion",JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,Jul 2016,2016,"We examine the cultural dimensions of participation in a debt management program (DMP). Archival data from Consumer Credit Counseling Service provide insights into the behavior of consumers in a DMP. Latino clients differ from Anglo clients, and are ultimately less successful in resolving debt problems. A key difference appears to be the expected monthly payment established for clients. While only debt level determines Latinos' expected payment, Anglos appear to better negotiate an expected payment from creditors, increasing their success. Importantly, homophily increases compliance for Latino debtor-counselor dyads. Overall, this study contributes to the transformative service research (TSR) literature by suggesting ways culture influences adherence to and completion of a DMP, leading to financial freedom for consumers in distress.

Growing Homophilic Networks Are Natural Navigable Small Worlds,PLOS ONE,Jun 27 2016,2016,"Navigability, an ability to find a logarithmically short path between elements using only local information, is one of the most fascinating properties of real-life networks. However, the exact mechanism responsible for the formation of navigation properties remained unknown. We show that navigability can be achieved by using only two ingredients present in the majority of networks: network growth and local homophily, giving a persuasive answer how the navigation appears in real-life networks. A very simple algorithm produces hierarchical self-similar optimally wired navigable small world networks with exponential degree distribution by using only local information. Adding preferential attachment produces a scale-free network which has shorter greedy paths, but worse (power law) scaling of the information extraction locality (algorithmic complexity of a search). Introducing saturation of the preferential attachment leads to truncated scale-free degree distribution that offers a good trade-off between these parameters and can be useful for practical applications. Several features of the model are observed in real-life networks, in particular in the brain neural networks, supporting the earlier suggestions that they are navigable.",
Mission Command in the Age of Network-Enabled Operations: Social Network Analysis of Information Sharing and Situation Awareness,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,Jun 22 2016,2016,"A common assumption in organizations is that information sharing improves situation awareness and ultimately organizational effectiveness. The sheer volume and rapid pace of information and communications received and readily accessible through computer networks, however, can overwhelm individuals, resulting in data overload from a combination of diverse data sources, multiple data formats, and large data volumes. The current conceptual framework of network enabled operations (NEO) posits that robust networking and information sharing act as a positive feedback loop resulting in greater situation awareness and mission effectiveness in military operations (Alberts and Garstka, 2004). We test this assumption in a large-scale, 2-week military training exercise. We conducted a social network analysis of email communications among the multi-echelon Mission Command staff (one Division and two sub-ordinate Brigades) and assessed the situational awareness of every individual. Results from our exponential random graph models challenge the aforementioned assumption, as increased email output was associated with lower individual situation awareness. It emerged that higher situation awareness was associated with a lower probability of out-ties, so that broadly sending many messages decreased the likelihood of attaining situation awareness. This challenges the hypothesis that increased information sharing improves situation awareness, at least for those doing the bulk of the sharing. In addition, we observed two trends that reflect a compartmentalizing of networked information sharing as email links were more commonly formed among members of the command staff with both similar functions and levels of situation awareness, than between two individuals with dissimilar functions and levels of situation awareness; both those findings can be interpreted to reflect effects of homophily. Our results have major implications that challenge the current conceptual framework of NEO. In addition, the information sharing network was largely imbalanced and dominated by a few key individuals so that most individuals in the network have very few email connections, but a small number of individuals have very many connections. These results highlight several major growing pains for networked organizations and military organizations in particular.",
Measure of Node Similarity in Multilayer Networks,PLOS ONE,Jun 14 2016,2016,"The weight of links in a network is often related to the similarity of the nodes. Here, we introduce a simple tunable measure for analysing the similarity of nodes across different link weights. In particular, we use the measure to analyze homophily in a group of 659 freshman students at a large university. Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom data collection software, complemented by questionnaire-based data. The network of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face contacts. We find that even strongly connected individuals are not more similar with respect to basic personality traits than randomly chosen pairs of individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels of acquaintanceships.",
Social networks and environmental outcomes,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jun 7 2016,2016,"Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.",
Social and Spatial Clustering of People at Humanity's Largest Gathering,PLOS ONE,Jun 3 2016,2016,"Macroscopic behavior of scientific and societal systems results from the aggregation of microscopic behaviors of their constituent elements, but connecting the macroscopic with the microscopic in human behavior has traditionally been difficult. Manifestations of homophily, the notion that individuals tend to interact with others who resemble them, have been observed in many small and intermediate size settings. However, whether this behavior translates to truly macroscopic levels, and what its consequences may be, remains unknown. Here, we use call detail records (CDRs) to examine the population dynamics and manifestations of social and spatial homophily at a macroscopic level among the residents of 23 states of India at the Kumbh Mela, a 3-month-long Hindu festival. We estimate that the festival was attended by 61 million people, making it the largest gathering in the history of humanity. While we find strong overall evidence for both types of homophily for residents of different states, participants from low-representation states show considerably stronger propensity for both social and spatial homophily than those from high-representation states. These manifestations of homophily are amplified on crowded days, such as the peak day of the festival, which we estimate was attended by 25 million people. Our findings confirm that homophily, which here likely arises from social influence, permeates all scales of human behavior.",
The Preference for Belief Consonance,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,SUM 2016,2016,"We consider the determinants and consequences of a source of utility that has received limited attention from economists: people's desire for the beliefs of other people to align with their own. We relate this 'preference for belief consonance' to a variety of other constructs that have been explored by economists, including identity, ideology, homophily, and fellow-feeling. We review different possible explanations for why people care about others' beliefs and propose that the preference for belief consonance leads to a range of disparate phenomena, including motivated belief-formation, proselytizing, selective exposure to media, avoidance of conversational minefields, pluralistic ignorance, belief-driven clustering, intergroup belief polarization, and conflict. We also discuss an explanation for why disputes are often so intense between groups whose beliefs are, by external observers' standards, highly similar to one-another.",
"Comparison of Respondent Driven Sampling Estimators to Determine HIV Prevalence and Population Characteristics among Men Who Have Sex with Men in Moscow, Russia",PLOS ONE,Jun 1 2016,2016,"Analytically distinct estimators have been proposed for the calculation of population-based estimates derived from respondent-driven sampling (RDS), yet there have been few comparisons of the inferences from these estimators using empirical data. We compared estimates produced by unweighted analysis used to calculate sample proportions and by three available estimators that are used to calculate population proportions, RDS-I, RDS-II (Volz-Heckathorn), and Gile's RDS-SS. Data were derived from a cross-sectional, RDS study of men who have sex with men (MSM) conducted from October 2010 to April 2013 in Moscow, Russia (N = 1,376, recruitment depth: 31 waves). Analyses investigated the influence of key parameters: recruitment depth, homophily, and network size on sample and population estimates. Variability in results produced by the estimators and recruitment depth were statistically compared using the coefficient of variation (CV). Sample proportions had the least variability across different recruitment depths, compared to the RDS estimators. Population estimates tended to differ at lower recruitment depth but were approximately equal after reaching sampling equilibrium, highlighting the importance of sampling to greater recruitment depth. All estimators incorporate inverse probability weighting using self-reported network size, explaining the similarities in across population estimates and the difference of these estimates relative to sample proportions. Current biases and limitations associated with RDS estimators are discussed.",
Partner Preference Among Men Who Have Sex with Men: Potential Contribution to Spread of HIV Within Minority Populations,LGBT HEALTH,Jun 2016,2016,"Purpose: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. Most prior research into drivers of HIV transmission has focused on individual characteristics rather than on dyadic-level behaviors such as sex partner selection. This article explores racial/ethnic preferences in sex and relationship partner selection among MSM to further contextualize the spread of HIV within minority groups.Methods: Participants were recruited through a mobile application (app) for men to meet other men in 2015 and completed an online survey on behaviors related to HIV risk. All analyses on the sample of 530 MSM were conducted in 2015.Results: There was significant homophily in partner selection within racial/ethnic minorities, but not for white MSM. In general, mobile app-using MSM reported a general preference for white and Hispanic men and a dispreference for black and Asian men, both for sex and relationship partners.Conclusion: Racial/ethnic preferences were found to drive intentions to form partnerships within this sample. Combined with the stigma many of these racial/ethnic minorities may also feel from homophobic attitudes within their own racial/ethnic communities, these MSM may be at particular risk for social isolation. These partner preferences likely affect the structure of the sexual networks of MSM and may contribute to increased clustering within high HIV incident sexual networks.",
"Race, Supervisorial Change, and Job Outcomes: Employability Resilience in NCAA Division I College Basketball Coaching",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,SUM 2016,2016,"We examine how race affects the employment status of subordinates following a job change by their immediate supervisors. We test whether racial homophily between a subordinate and a supervisor affects the odds of being let go. We also consider whether a racial match between an incoming head coach and assistant affects whether assistants retain their assistant coaching position. Data for these analyses come from a unique data set that explores what happens to 704 NCAA Division I college basketball assistant coaches after the head coach leaves the school. Logistic regression analyses confirm the benefit of working for a white head coach as this decreases the likelihood of being let go, compared to more positive outcomes such as following the coach to a new school, being internally promoted or retained after the head coach's departure. Furthermore, racial homophily with incoming head coaches insulates subordinates from having to search for new employment by increasing the likelihood of assistants being retained.",
It takes two to tango: Exploring social tie development with both online and offline interactions,STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING,Jun 2016,2016,"Understanding social tie development among users is crucial for user engagement in social networking services. In this paper, we analyze the social interactions, both online and offline, of users and investigate the development of their social ties using data trail of how social ties grow' left in mobile and social networking services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research attempt on studying social tie development by considering both online and offline interactions in a heterogeneous yet realistic relationship. In this study, we aim to answer three key questions: (i) is there a correlation between online and offline interactions? (ii) how is the social tie developed via heterogeneous interaction channels? and (iii) would the development of social tie between two users be affected by their common friends? To achieve our goal, we develop a Social-aware Hidden Markov Model (SaHMM) that explicitly takes into account the factor of common friends in measure of the social tie development. Our experiments show that, comparing with results obtained using HMM and other heuristic methods, the social tie development captured by our SaHMM is significantly more consistent to lifetime profiles of users.",
Predicting Peer Nominations Among Medical Students: A Social Network Approach,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,Jun 2016,2016,"PurposeMinimal attention has been paid to what factors may predict peer nomination or how peer nominations might exhibit a clustering effect. Focusing on the homophily principle that ""birds of a feather flock together,"" and using a social network analysis approach, the authors investigated how certain student-and/or school-based factors might predict the likelihood of peer nomination, and the clusters, if any, that occur among those nominations.MethodIn 2013, the Jefferson Longitudinal Study of Medical Education included a special instrument to evaluate peer nominations. A total of 211 (81%) of 260 graduating medical students from the Sidney Kimmel Medical College responded to the peer nomination question. Data were analyzed using a relational contingency table and an ANOVA density model.ResultsAlthough peer nominations did not cluster around gender, age, or class rank, those students within an accelerated program, as well as those entering certain specialties, were more likely to nominate each other. The authors suggest that clerkships in certain specialties, as well as the accelerated program, may provide structured opportunities for students to connect and integrate, and that these opportunities may have an impact on peer nomination. The findings suggest that social network analysis is a useful approach to examine various aspects of peer nomination processes.ConclusionsThe authors discuss implications regarding harnessing social cohesion within clinical clerkships, the possible development of siloed departmental identity and in-group favoritism, and future research possibilities.",
"The Effect of Electronic Word of Mouth on Sales: A Meta-Analytic Review of Platform, Product, and Metric Factors",JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH,Jun 2016,2016,"The increasing amount of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has significantly affected the way consumers make purchase decisions. Empirical studies have established an effect of eWOM on sales but disagree on which online platforms, products, and eWOM metrics moderate this effect. The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 1,532 effect sizes across 96 studies covering 40 platforms and 26 product categories. On average, eWOM is positively correlated with sales (. 091), but its effectiveness differs across platform, product, and metric factors. For example, the effectiveness of eWOM on social media platforms is stronger when eWOM receivers can assess their own similarity to eWOM senders, whereas these homophily details do not influence the effectiveness of eWOM for e-commerce platforms. In addition, whereas eWOM has a stronger effect on sales for tangible goods new to the market, the product life cycle does not moderate the eWOM effectiveness for services. With respect to the eWOM metrics, eWOM volume has a stronger impact on sales than eWOM valence. In addition, negative eWOM does not always jeopardize sales, but high variability does.",
Market formation as transitive closure: The evolving pattern of trade in music,NETWORK SCIENCE,Jun 2016,2016,"Where do new markets come from? I construct a network model in which national markets are nodes and flows of recorded music between them are links and conduct a longitudinal analysis of the global pattern of trade in the period 1976-2010. I hypothesize that new export markets are developed through a process of transitive closure in the network of international trade. When two countries' markets experience the same social influences, it brings them close enough together for new homophilous ties to be formed. The implication is that consumption of foreign products helps, not hurts, home-market producers develop overseas markets, but only in those countries that have a history of consuming the same foreign products that were consumed in the home market. Selling in a market changes what is valued in that market, and new market formation is a consequence of having social influences in common.",
Evolutionary Process of Social Capital Formation through Community Currency Organizations: The Japanese Case,VOLUNTAS,Jun 2016,2016,"Community currency systems are said to influence the revival of communities by promoting either local economic growth or social capital accumulation. However, no empirical studies have examined the multiple competing mechanisms for providing social support through transactional networks among participants. The current study connects network structural concepts to theories of social capital, transaction costs, homophily, and resource dependency at multiple levels and evaluates transactional relationships for community rebuilding and local economic development. We examine the evolutionary process of dynamic networks among local residents or organization members with network configurations in one of the largest Japanese community currency systems, ""Peanuts."" Using longitudinal network data over 12 years for approximately 1400 actors, we conclude that the evolution and achievement of transactional network dynamics and partner selections differ between the two groups of participants: individual members and organization members. We also provide practical implications for sustaining participants' transactions and commitment.",
Can online contacts between immigrants and veterans facilitate immigrants' social integration?,ETHNICITIES,Jun 2016,2016,"The current study analyzes whether cross-cultural communication through online social platforms between immigrants from the Former Soviet Union and different sectors of veteran Israelis reduces social distances and facilitates immigrants' integration. The research was conducted through an online survey of 296 Former Soviet Union immigrants who use social media sites in Hebrew. The findings show a positive impact of online contacts, only on social distances toward groups with very different cultures from Former Soviet Union immigrants: Arabs and ultra-orthodox Jews. Online contacts were found not to have a positive impact on social distances between immigrants and veteran Israelis from the dominant culture. In other words, online contact was not found to contribute to the social integration of Former Soviet Union immigrants, but the social media were found to have the potential to narrow cleavages in Israeli society by reducing stigmas and alienation.",
Gender homophily in online dyadic and triadic relationships,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,May 12 2016,2016,"Gender homophily, or the preference for interaction with individuals of the same gender, has been observed in many contexts, especially during childhood and adolescence. In this study we investigate such phenomenon by analyzing the interactions of the similar to 10 million users of Tuenti, a Spanish social networking service popular among teenagers. In dyadic relationships we find evidence of higher gender homophily for women. We also observe a preference of users with more friends to connect to the opposite gender. A particularly marked gender difference emerges in signing up for the social networking service and adding the first friends, and in the interactions by means of wall messages. In these contexts we find evidence of a strong homophily for women, and little or no homophily for men. By examining the gender composition of triangle motifs, we observe a marked tendency of users to group into gender homogeneous clusters, with a particularly high number of male-only triangles. We show that age plays an important role in this context, with a tendency to higher homophily for young teenagers in both dyadic and triadic relationships. Our findings have implications for addressing gender gap issues, understanding adolescent online behavior and technology adoption, and modeling social networks.",
In game we trust? Coplay and generalized trust in and beyond a Chinese MMOG world,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,May 3 2016,2016,"Although an emerging literature has demonstrated social and civic potentials of massively multiplayer online games, few studies have assessed their implications for generalized trust. Drawing on a large sample of Chevaliers' Romance III (CR3) players, this research examines how gamers' motivational, behavioral, and relational factors are related to generalized trust in China. Adopting a coplaying-centered approach, results show that generalized trust is enabled and constrained by teammate preference, coplay patterns, and motivations. Competence preference in teammates, having more weak-tie confidants as coplayers, and competition motivation are positively, while homophily preference in teammates, having more strong-tie confidants as coplayers, and socializing motivation are negatively associated with generalized trust. This research highlights the importance of contextualizing gaming implications in specific social and institutional contexts.",
Bubbling Up the Good Ideas: A Two-Mode Network Analysis of an Intra-Organizational Idea Challenge,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,May 2016,2016,"Organizations have been experimenting with intraorganizational crowdsourcing (IOC), yet the mechanisms of IOC production remain an underresearched topic. Drawing on a 2-mode ERGM, we examine structural mechanisms and individual-level factors that shape the network structure of idea generation and selection yielded by an IOC idea challenge in a global IT corporation. Results show a Matthew effect leading to 1) highly centralized employee participation around a few ""superactive"" employees who engage with many ideas and 2) highly centralized idea popularity with a few ideas attracting most employee attention. We find support for shared affiliations among employee-idea clusters in the first half of the participation, which is, however, less likely in the second half. We also find support for geographic homophily.",
"Preferences, Homophily, and Social Learning",OPERATIONS RESEARCH,MAY-JUN 2016,2016,"We study a sequential model of Bayesian social learning in networks in which agents have heterogeneous preferences, and neighbors tend to have similar preferences-a phenomenon known as homophily. We find that the density of network connections determines the impact of preference diversity and homophily on learning. When connections are sparse, diverse preferences are harmful to learning, and homophily may lead to substantial improvements. In contrast, in a dense network, preference diversity is beneficial. Intuitively, diverse ties introduce more independence between observations while providing less information individually. Homophilous connections individually carry more useful information, but multiple observations become redundant.",
Birds of a feather locate together? Foursquare checkins and personality homophily,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,May 2016,2016,"In this paper we consider whether people with similar personality traits have a preference for common locations. Due to the difficulty in tracking and categorising the places that individuals choose to visit, this is largely unexplored. However, the recent popularity of location-based social networks (LBSNs) provides a means to gain new insight into this question through checkins- records that are made by LBSN users of their presence at specific street level locations. A web-based participatory survey was used to collect the personality traits and checkin behaviour of 174 anonymous users, who, through their common check-ins, formed a network with 5373 edges and an approximate edge density of 35%. We assess the degree of overlap in personality traits for users visiting common locations, as detected by user checkins. We find that people with similar high levels of conscientiousness, openness or agreeableness tended to have checked-in locations in common. The findings for extraverts were unexpected in that they did not provide evidence of individuals assorting at the same locations, contrary to predictions. Individuals high in neuroticism were in line with expectations, they did not tend to have locations in common. Unanticipated results concerning disagreeableness are of particular interest and suggest that different venue types and distinctive characteristics may act as attractors for people with particularly selective tendencies. These findings have important implications for decision-making and location. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of shocks on international networks: Changes in the attributes of states and the structure of international alliance networks,JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH,May 2016,2016,"We study the effects of shocks - such as major wars that change states' strategic environments - on alliance networks. This has important implications for the structure of security cooperation networks. We develop an agent-based model (ABM) that: (1) models network evolution processes of security cooperation networks; (2) induces shocks that cause significant changes in agents' utilities due to shifts in common interests between states; (3) analyzes how networks reorganize in the post-shock period. We derive propositions from the ABM about the relationship between shock attributes and network structure. We compare the results of the ABM to similar shocks that operate on real-world alliance networks. The ABM results with random network data suggest that states that experience dramatic changes in their strategic environment increase network connectivity and consistency. Consequently, post-shock networks become increasingly connected (denser) and consistent (transitive). With a few notable exceptions, these results are corroborated by analysis of alliance network reorganization following shocks. We discuss the theoretical and empirical implications of the results and offer directions for future research on shocks and international networks.",
Endogenous thresholds and assurance networks in collective action,RATIONALITY AND SOCIETY,May 2016,2016,"This article treats a multi-player Stag Hunt where each player may have a different threshold (the number of other players that need to act along with the player for benefits of collective action to arise). Players are modeled as solving the strategic-uncertainty problem of whether or not to act, by assuring each other of their willingness to act. We show that in equilibrium there may, but need not, be homophily (players with the same thresholds seek assurance from each other) or a threshold-based social hierarchy (players with high thresholds, or conservatives, seek assurance from players with low thresholds, or radicals, but not vice versa). Put otherwise, a new strategic-uncertainty problem arises, namely, the problem of who should seek assurance from whom. We propose that players solve this problem by forming core-periphery assurance networks, with a number of players equal to the largest threshold in the core, and the remaining players in the periphery.",
"Hierarchical, Decentralized, or Something Else? Opposition Networks in the German Bundestag",LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY,May 2016,2016,"Members of the German parliament may force government to publicly answer questions by issuing minor interpellations (kleine Anfragen). We use 3,608 interpellations from the session 2009-13 that have been signed by authoring and supporting members to construct the social network of support relations among members within the three opposition parties. We find that parties differ markedly in terms of internal structure. While social democrats organize hierarchically, Greens cooperate horizontally. The network for socialist Linke in contrast shows signs of homophily and social segregation. Our approach yields a novel perspective on intraparty politics in parliamentary systems which are notoriously difficult to analyze.",
When Birds of a Feather Don't Flock Together: A Macrostructural Approach to Interracial Crime,SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,May 2016,2016,"The greater prevalence of intraracial crime to interracial crime is a common finding in criminology. This issue is best understood when specific crimes are studied from a proper theoretical basis. We argue that variation in rates of cross-racial crime is explained by homophily bias, reflected in residential segregation, in conjunction with the motivational mindset of an offender, specifically whether a crime is instrumental or expressive in nature. We hypothesize that homophily bias is stronger in expressive crimes than it is in instrumental crimes. Using the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for 2009 and 2010, we analyze robbery and aggravated assault as instrumental and expressive crimes, respectively. The analyses show that racial residential segregation increases, as expected, the relative frequency of black intraracial assault to black interracial assault, whereas it does not affect the relative frequency in robbery. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, the same variable shows little effect on the relative frequency of white intraracial to interracial assault. We give possible explanations as to why white crimes are insensitive to residential segregation.",
Participation in Voluntary Associations and Social Contact of Immigrants in Canada,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,May 2016,2016,"We explore how participation by immigrants in voluntary groups is related to their social contact patterns. Our discussion is guided by the structural integration and the homophily perspectives. Drawing from the 2008 Canadian General Social Survey, the findings in general support the structural integration perspective. The findings also show that frequency of participation in voluntary groups and number of voluntary associations participated have independent and significant positive relationships with socioeconomic range of contact and number of high-status contacts, except that the number of voluntary associations involved does not relate to the number of high-status contacts among immigrants. In addition, the findings show that receiving education overseas does not relate to the range of contact and high-status contact. However, visible minority immigrants significantly has lower socioeconomic range of contact than other immigrants even controlling for voluntary association participation.",
"The Influence of Gender, Age, Matriline and Hierarchical Rank on Individual Social Position, Role and Interactional Patterns in Macaca sylvanus at 'La Foret des Singes': A Multilevel Social Network Approach",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,Apr 18 2016,2016,"A society is a complex system composed of individuals that can be characterized by their own attributes that influence their behaviors. In this study, a specific analytical protocol based on social network analysis was adopted to investigate the influence of four attributes (gender, age, matriline, and hierarchical rank) on affiliative (allogrooming) and agonistic networks in a non-human primate species, Macaca sylvanus, at the park La Foret des Singes in France. The results show significant differences with respect to the position (i.e., centric, peripheral) and role (i.e., implication in the network cohesiveness) of an individual within a social network and hence interactional patterns. Females are more central, more active, and have a denser ego network in the affiliative social network tan males; thus, they contribute in a greater way to the cohesive structure of the network. High-ranking individuals are likely to receive fewer agonistic behaviors than low-ranking individuals, and high-ranking females receive more allogrooming. I also observe homophily for affiliative interactions regarding all attributes and homophily for agonistic interactions regarding gender and age. Revealing the positions, the roles, and the interactional behavioral patterns of individuals can help understand the mechanisms that shape the overall structure of a social network.",
Institutions and Cultural Diversity: Effects of Democratic and Propaganda Processes on Local Convergence and Global Diversity,PLOS ONE,Apr 8 2016,2016,"In a connected world where people influence each other, what can cause a globalized monoculture, and which measures help to preserve the coexistence of cultures? Previous research has shown that factors such as homophily, population size, geography, mass media, and type of social influence play important roles. In the present paper, we investigate for the first time the impact that institutions have on cultural diversity. In our first three studies, we extend existing agent-based models and explore the effects of institutional influence and agent loyalty. We find that higher institutional influence increases cultural diversity, while individuals' loyalty to their institutions has a small, preserving effect. In three further studies, we test how bottom-up and top-down processes of institutional influence impact our model. We find that bottom-up democratic practices, such as referenda, tend to produce convergence towards homogeneity, while top-down information dissemination practices, such as propaganda, further increase diversity. In our last model-an integration of bottom-up and topdown processes into a feedback loop of information-we find that when democratic processes are rare, the effects of propaganda are amplified, i.e., more diversity emerges; however, when democratic processes are common, they are able to neutralize or reverse this propaganda effect. Importantly, our models allow for control over the full spectrum of diversity, so that a manipulation of our parameters can result in preferred levels of diversity, which will be useful for the study of other factors in the future. We discuss possible mechanisms behind our results, applications, and implications for political and social sciences.",
Narcissism and Newlywed Marriage: Partner Characteristics and Marital Trajectories,PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT,Apr 2016,2016,"Despite narcissism's relation with interpersonal dysfunction, surprisingly little empirical research has been devoted to understanding narcissism's effect on intimate relationships in general or marital relationships in particular. The current study addressed this gap using longitudinal data from a community sample of 146 newlywed couples assessed 6 times over the first 4 years of marriage. First, we examined partner characteristics associated with higher levels of narcissism to determine the degree to which couples were matched on narcissism and related traits. Second, we examined how narcissism predicted the trajectory of marital quality over time, testing narcissism's association with initial levels of relationship functioning (the intercept) and changes in relationship functioning (the slope). Results indicated a small degree of homophily but otherwise no clear pattern of partner characteristics for individuals higher in narcissism. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that wives' total narcissism and entitlement/exploitativeness scores predicted the slope of marital quality over time, including steeper declines in marital satisfaction and steeper increases in marital problems. Husbands' narcissism scores generally had few effects on their own marital quality or that of their wives. These findings are notable in indicating that the effects of personality characteristics on marital functioning may take some time to manifest themselves, even if they were present from early in the marriage. Future research into the mediating psychological and interpersonal processes that link wives' narcissism with poorer marital functioning over time would be valuable.",
HOMOPHILY AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN NETWORKS,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMIC THEORY,Apr 2016,2016,"This paper proposes a strategy to estimate the community structure for a network accounting for the empirically established fact that communities and links are formed based on homophily. It presents a maximum likelihood approach to rank community structures where the set of possible community structures depends on the set of salient characteristics and the probability of a link between two nodes varies according to the characteristics of the two nodes. This approach has good large sample properties, which lead to a practical algorithm for the estimation. To exemplify the approach it is applied to data collected from four village clusters in Ghana.",
Cultural niche construction of repertoire size and learning strategies in songbirds,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY,Apr 2016,2016,"Birdsong is a complex cultural and biological system, and the selective forces driving evolutionary changes in aspects of song learning vary considerably among species. The extent to which repertoire size, the number of syllables or song types sung by a bird, is subject to sexual selection is unknown, and studies to date have provided inconsistent evidence. Here, we propose that selection pressure on the size and complexity of birdsong repertoires may facilitate the construction of a niche in which learning, sexual selection, and song-based homophily may co-evolve. We show, using a review of the birdsong literature and mathematical modeling, that learning mode (open-ended or closed-ended learning) is correlated with the size of birdsong repertoires. Underpinning this correlation may be a form of cultural niche construction in which a costly biological trait (for example, open-ended learning) can spread in a population (or be lost) as a result of direct selection on an associated cultural trait (for example, song repertoire size).",
Similarity-attraction effects in friendship formation: Honest platoon-mates prefer each other but dishonest do not,PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES,Apr 2016,2016,"Friends tend to be similar on many characteristics, including personality traits. Yet, a real-world similarity attraction effect based on actual personality traits is not supported by current research. One reason for this apparent contradiction could be that dark personality traits have been absent from this literature. In a sample (N = 181) of military cadet freshmen, we investigated homophily (""love of the same"") based on the traits identified by the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and two dark personality traits, Manipulativeness and Egotism. We did not find homophily based on the FFM traits. However, platoon-mate dyads with similar levels of trait Manipulativeness or Egotism were more likely to mutually like each other. Furthermore, response surface analyses revealed that homophily for these two traits occurred only at the low, or bright, end of these traits. Our results support arguments derived from evolutionary theory that argue for the importance of trait honesty in friendship formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Viral Altruism? Charitable Giving and Social Contagion in Online Networks,SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE,Mar 24 2016,2016,"How do social media affect the success of charitable campaigns? We show that, despite the promise of online platforms to generate social network effects in generosity through social contagion or peer effects, these platforms may instead stimulate costless (and less impactful) forms of involvement. Online social contagion might thus be limited when it comes to contributing real money to charities. This study relies on both individual-level longitudinal data and experimental evidence from a social media application that facilitates donations while broadcasting donors' activities to their contacts. We find that broadcasting is positively associated with donations, although some individuals appear to opportunistically broadcast a pledge and then delete it. Furthermore, broadcasting a pledge is associated with more pledges by a user's contacts, suggesting the presence of network effects or social contagion. However, results from a field experiment where broadcasting of the initial pledges was randomized suggest that the observational findings were likely due to homophily rather than genuine contagion effects. The experiment also shows that, although the campaigns reached approximately 6.4 million users and generated considerable attention in the form of clicks and ""likes,"" only 30 donations were made. Finally, an online survey experiment indicates that both the presence of an intermediary and a fee contributed to the low donation rate.",
Evolutionary Dynamics of Homophily and Heterophily,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Mar 8 2016,2016,"Most social interactions do not take place at random. In many situations, individuals choose their interaction partners on the basis of phenotypic cues. When this happens, individuals are often homophilic, that is, they tend to interact with individuals that are similar to them. Here we investigate the joint evolution of phenotypic cues and cue-dependent interaction strategies. By a combination of individual-based simulations and analytical arguments, we show that homophily evolves less easily than earlier studies suggest. The evolutionary interplay of cues and cue-based behaviour is intricate and has many interesting facets. For example, an interaction strategy like heterophily may stably persist in the population even if it is selected against in association with any particular cue. Homophily persisted for extensive periods of time just in those simulations where homophilic interactions provide a lower (rather than a higher) payoff than heterophilic interactions. Our results indicate that even the simplest cue-based social interactions can have rich dynamics and a surprising diversity of evolutionary outcomes.",
Homophily and missing links in citation networks,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,Mar 3 2016,2016,"Citation networks have been widely used to study the evolution of science through the lenses of the underlying patterns of knowledge flows among academic papers, authors, research sub-fields, and scientific journals. Here we focus on citation networks to cast light on the salience of homophily, namely the principle that similarity breeds connection, for knowledge transfer between papers. To this end, we assess the degree to which citations tend to occur between papers that are concerned with seemingly related topics or research problems. Drawing on a large data set of articles published in the journals of the American Physical Society between 1893 and 2009, we propose a novel method for measuring the similarity between articles through the statistical validation of the overlap between their bibliographies. Results suggest that the probability of a citation made by one article to another is indeed an increasing function of the similarity between the two articles. Our study also enables us to uncover missing citations between pairs of highly related articles, and may thus help identify barriers to effective knowledge flows. By quantifying the proportion of missing citations, we conduct a comparative assessment of distinct journals and research sub-fields in terms of their ability to facilitate or impede the dissemination of knowledge. Findings indicate that Electromagnetism and Interdisciplinary Physics are the two sub-fields in physics with the smallest percentage of missing citations. Moreover, knowledge transfer seems to be more effectively facilitated by journals of wide visibility, such as Physical Review Letters, than by lower-impact ones. Our study has important implications for authors, editors and reviewers of scientific journals, as well as public preprint repositories, as it provides a procedure for recommending relevant yet missing references and properly integrating bibliographies of papers.",
Detection of Homophilic Communities and Coordination of Interacting Meta-Agents: A Game-Theoretic Viewpoint,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING OVER NETWORKS,Mar 2016,2016,"This paper studies two important signal processing aspects of homophilic behavior namely, detection of homophilic communities and the distributed coordination of meta-agents, which interact with the detected homophilic communities. First, the theory of revealed preferences from microeconomics is used to construct a nonparametric decision test for homophilic behavior using only the time series of external influences and associated agents' responses. These tests rely on rationalizing the dataset of agents' actions as the play from the Nash equilibrium of a concave potential game. A stochastic gradient algorithm is given to optimize the external influence signal in real time to minimize the Type-II error probabilities of the detection test subject to specified Type-I error probability. Using the decision test, methods are provided to detect for homophilic communities. Subsequently, a nonparametric algorithm is presented that uses the constructed potential function for the potential game to predict the preferences of the detected homophilic communities. Second, we present a non-cooperative game model for interaction of meta-agents that interact with the communities and propose an algorithm that prescribes meta-agents how to take actions based on the preference of the communities and past interaction information with other meta-agents. The proposed algorithm has two timescales: the slow timescale is the nonparametric preference learning presented in the first part, and the fast timescale is a regret-matching stochastic approximation algorithm. It is shown that, if all meta-agents follow the proposed algorithm, their collective behavior is attracted to the correlated equilibria set of the game. This means that meta-agents can co-ordinate their strategies in a distributed fashion as if there exists a centralized coordinating device that they all trust to follow. We provide a real-world example using the energy market, and a numerical example to detect malicious agents in an online social network.",
Determinants of Word-of-Mouth Influence in Sport Viewership,JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT,Mar 2016,2016,"The purpose of this study was to identify key characteristics of word-of-mouth (WOM) communication and examine their impact on sport consumers' perceived influence in sport viewership. Through an extensive literature review, we identified the characteristics of the message sender (i.e., expertise and trustworthiness) and the message (i.e., richness of message content and strength of message delivery) as determinants of perceived influence of WOM. We also examined the moderating effects of homophily (interpersonal factors) and involvement (the message receiver characteristics). Data were collected from sport consumers who had received a recommendation to watch a sporting event in the preceding 3 months and actually watched the event. The results indicate the positive effects of trustworthiness, richness of message content, and strength of message delivery on WOM influence. Homophily and involvement were found to have moderating effects. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.",
Diversity and Community Can Coexist,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,Mar 2016,2016,"We examine the (in)compatibility of diversity and sense of community by means of agent-based models based on the well-known Schelling model of residential segregation and Axelrod model of cultural dissemination. We find that diversity and highly clustered social networks, on the assumptions of social tie formation based on spatial proximity and homophily, are incompatible when agent features are immutable, and this holds even for multiple independent features. We include both mutable and immutable features into a model that integrates Schelling and Axelrod models, and we find that even for multiple independent features, diversity and highly clustered social networks can be incompatible on the assumptions of social tie formation based on spatial proximity and homophily. However, this incompatibility breaks down when cultural diversity can be sufficiently large, at which point diversity and clustering need not be negatively correlated. This implies that segregation based on immutable characteristics such as race can possibly be overcome by sufficient similarity on mutable characteristics based on culture, which are subject to a process of social influence, provided a sufficiently large scope of cultural possibilities exists.",
Integrated microblog sentiment analysis from users' social interaction patterns and textual opinions,APPLIED INTELLIGENCE,Mar 2016,2016,"Traditional post-level opinion classification methods usually fail to capture a person's overall sentiment orientation toward a topic from his/her microblog posts published for a variety of themes related to that topic. One reason for this is that the sentiments connoted in the textual expressions of microblog posts are often obscure. Moreover, a person's opinions are often influenced by his/her social network. This study therefore proposes a new method based on integrated information of microblog users' social interactions and textual opinions to infer the sentiment orientation of a user or the whole group regarding a hot topic. A Social Opinion Graph (SOG) is first constructed as the data model for sentiment analysis of a group of microblog users who share opinions on a topic. This represents their social interactions and opinions. The training phase then uses the SOGs of training sets to construct Sentiment Guiding Matrix (SGM), representing the knowledge about the correlation between users' sentiments, Textual Sentiment Classifier (TSC), and emotion homophily coefficients of the influence of various types of social interaction on users' mutual sentiments. All of these support a high-performance social sentiment analysis procedure based on the relaxation labeling scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better sentiment classification accuracy than the textual classification and other integrated classification methods. In addition, IMSA can reduce pre-annotation overheads and the influence from sampling deviation.",
A simple model of two-stage choice,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY,Mar 2016,2016,"I provide choice-theoretic foundations for a simple two-stage model, called transitive shortlist methods, where choices are made by sequentially by applying a pair of transitive preferences (or rationales) to eliminate inferior alternatives. Despite its simplicity, the model accommodates a wide range of choice phenomena including the status quo bias, framing, homophily, compromise, and limited willpower. I establish that the model can be succinctly characterized in terms of some well-documented context effects in choice. I also show that the underlying rationales are straightforward to determine from readily observable reversals in choice. Finally, I highlight the usefulness of these results in a variety of applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Emergence of a multilayer structure in adaptive networks of phase oscillators,CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS,Mar 2016,2016,"We report on self-organization of adaptive networks, where topology and dynamics evolve in accordance to a competition between homophilic and homeostatic mechanisms, and where links are associated to a vector of weights. Under an appropriate balance between the intra- and inter- layer coupling strengths, we show that a multilayer structure emerges due to the adaptive evolution, resulting in different link weights at each layer, i.e. different components of the weights' vector. In parallel, synchronized clusters at each layer are formed, which may overlap or not, depending on the values of the coupling strengths. Only when intra- and inter- layer coupling strengths are high enough, all layers reach identical final topologies, collapsing the system into, in fact, a monolayer network. The relationships between such steady state topologies and a set of dynamical network's properties are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
The cost of friendship,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS,Mar 2016,2016,"We investigate how personal characteristics affect people's desire to collaborate and whether this attraction enhances or detracts from performance in venture capital. We find that venture capitalists who share the same ethnic, educational, or career background are more likely to syndicate with each other. This homophily reduces the probability of investment success, and the detrimental effect is most prominent for early-stage investments. A variety of tests show that the cost of affinity is most likely attributable to poor decision making by high-affinity syndicates after the investment is made. These results suggest that ""birds-of-a-feather-flock-together"" effects in collaboration can be costly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Message Framing Matters: Communicating Climate Change with Forest Landowners,JOURNAL OF FORESTRY,Mar 2016,2016,"To enhance their livelihoods and important ecosystem services, forest landowners in the southeastern United States could benefit from being aware of the potential impacts of future climate changes on their forests. Communicating information about climate risks, however, is challenging. This study explored the effect of message frames in videos on forest landowners' attitudes and intention to implement forest management practices for adapting to potential climate changes. Videos were sent electronically to landowners with a prevideo and postvideo surveys. Although the four videos motivated modest intention to act, only those that included stewardship values in their message framing resulted in increased feelings of efficacy. Perceived similarities between the viewer and the speaker were important for the viewer to trust the speaker, and when values portrayed in the video aligned with viewers' values, the viewers were more apt to like the videos, trust the speakers, and express an intention to act.",
Development of radio dramas for health communication pilot intervention in Canadian Inuit communities,HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL,Mar 2016,2016,"A mixed-methods approach was used to develop a culturally appropriate health intervention over radio within the Inuit community of Pangnirtung, Nunavut (NU), Canada. The radio dramas were developed, recorded and tested pre-intervention through the use of Participatory Process and informed by the extended elaboration likelihood model (EELM) for education-communication. The radio messages were tested in two focus groups (n = 4 and n = 5) to determine fidelity of the radio dramas to the EELM theory. Focus group feedback identified that revisions needed to be made to two characteristics required of educational programmes by the EELM theorem: first, the quality of the production was improved by adding Inuit youth recorded music and second, the homophily (relatability of characters) of radio dramas was improved by re-recording the dramas with voices of local youth who had been trained in media communication studies. These adjustments would not have been implemented had pre-intervention testing of the radio dramas not taken place and could have reduced effectiveness of the overall intervention. Therefore, it is highly recommended that media tools for health communication/education be tested with the intended target audience before commencement of programmes. Participatory Process was identified to be a powerful tool in the development and sustainability of culturally appropriate community health programming.",
Respect and Disrespect in Deliberation Across the Networked Media Environment: Examining Multiple Paths of Political Talk,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Mar 2016,2016,"There is extensive research dedicated to civility in online deliberation, but empirical studies on mutual respect are still scarce. By adopting a systemic approach to deliberation, this study identifies different targets of disrespect (conversation partners, arguments, actors and groups involved in a certain conflict, profanity without a clear target), and investigates their relations with deliberation in different online contexts. This paper argues that the nature of digital affordances related to anonymity and homophily influences the expression of foul language, but not as significantly as was originally assumed. Analysis reveals that online social norms help to explain the configuration of interactions and practices of reasoning together in YouTube, blogs, and Facebook; and the extent to which profanity affects justification and reciprocity.",
Purity Homophily in Social Networks,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL,Mar 2016,2016,"Does sharing moral values encourage people to connect and form communities? The importance of moral homophily (love of same) has been recognized by social scientists, but the types of moral similarities that drive this phenomenon are still unknown. Using both large-scale, observational social-media analyses and behavioral lab experiments, the authors investigated which types of moral similarities influence tie formations. Analysis of a corpus of over 700,000 tweets revealed that the distance between 2 people in a social-network can be predicted based on differences in the moral purity content-but not other moral content-of their messages. The authors replicated this finding by experimentally manipulating perceived moral difference (Study 2) and similarity (Study 3) in the lab and demonstrating that purity differences play a significant role in social distancing. These results indicate that social network processes reflect moral selection, and both online and offline differences in moral purity concerns are particularly predictive of social distance. This research is an attempt to study morality indirectly using an observational big-data study complemented with 2 confirmatory behavioral experiments carried out using traditional social-psychology methodology.",
The Enabling and Constraining Effects of Social Ties in the Process of Institutional Entrepreneurship,ORGANIZATION STUDIES,Mar 2016,2016,"While the past decade has produced a number of insights into the process of institutional change, scholars still lack a comprehensive understanding of the germinal stages of institutional entrepreneurship. More specifically, further knowledge is needed into what factors cause certain individuals to initiate norm-breaking behaviour while others continue to adhere to societal expectations. Prior work seeking to inform this question has focused either on individual-level or environmental-level explanations. Comparatively, we employ a social network perspective as a meso-level' lens into the space where actors and their environment intersect. Based upon our qualitative findings, we propose that social ties can serve as an important factor in enabling (heterophilic ties) as well as constraining (homophilic ties) institutional change. However, our data also suggest that these network forces are highly dynamic and contingent upon tie frequency, the sequencing of tie contact, and the prevailing social norms in which tie contact takes place.",
Social capital and homophily both matter for labor market outcomes - evidence from replication and extension,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Mar 2016,2016,"Social resource theory has been challenged, as the effects of contact resources on job outcomes may be spurious given the presence of homophily. We review the Mouw-Lin debate and propose that occupational homophily moderates the role of contact resources in the labor market and that effects of resources depend on labor market institutions. We analyze data from the US, East Germany before 1989, and post-reform China, combining the first-difference method and Heckman selection procedure to deal with endogeneity. Empirical findings from different labor market contexts demonstrate that: (1) contact resources have a causal and positive role in job outcomes; (2) in a market economy, the role of resources is more salient if they provide within-occupation job-leads; (3) under state job-assignment systems occupational homophily does not pay off; and (4) job-search ties can take the form of heterophilous selection.

Like two peas in a pod? Explaining friendship selection processes related to victimization and offending,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY,Mar 2016,2016,"In this paper, we examine the similarity between friends with respect to experiences with crime among a sample of Dutch individuals. We investigate the extent to which offenders, victims and victim-offenders (de)select friends differently and, subsequently, who (de)selects whom and why. We use data from the annual Dutch panel survey CrimeNL, which includes ego-centered network measures at each wave for more than 500 participants, ranging from 16 to 45 years old. Results show that offenders terminate friendships more often than non-offenders, and they have a higher likelihood of selecting new friends, regardless of prior victimization experiences. Furthermore, homophily with respect to crime involvement exists; both offenders and victims are more likely to select new friends who are similarly involved in crime. Risky lifestyles to a large extent explain why people select offenders as friends, whereas third parties (that is, parents and the pre-existing network of individuals) influence people's decision to engage in friendships with victims of crime. Nevertheless, after taking individual preferences, meeting opportunities and third parties into account, offenders and victims are still more likely to select friends with similar crime experiences.",
It's the way he tells them (and who is listening): men's dominance is positively correlated with their preference for jokes told by dominant-sounding men,EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Mar 2016,2016,"While much research has explored humorous exchange in relation to mate choice, recent perspectives have emphasized the importance of humor for monitoring interest within social partnerships more generally. Indeed, given that similarity is thought to be important in the maintenance of social partnerships, we may expect humor appreciation to vary according to the degree of similarity between humor producers and recipients. In the current study we report evidence for such variation that is specific to men's judgments of other men's humor. Here we manipulated voice pitch in a set of 'one-liner' jokes to create low-pitched and high-pitched versions of men and women telling jokes. A composite measure of men's own dominance was positively correlated with their preference for jokes told by other men with lowered voice pitch (a vocal cue to dominance). A follow-up study demonstrated that self-reported dominance was positively related to men's choice of low-pitch men as friends when judging humorous audio clips but not when judging neutral control audio clips, suggesting that humor may be important in mediating the effect of dominance on friendship choice. These studies indicate systematic variation in humor appreciation related to friendship choices which may function to promote cohesion within male partnerships based on status. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The role of partners' educational attainment in the association between HIV and education amongst women in seven sub-Saharan African countries,JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY,Feb 19 2016,2016,"Introduction: Individuals' educational attainment has long been considered as a risk factor for HIV. However, little attention has been paid to the association between partner educational attainment and HIV infection.Methods: We conducted cross-sectional analysis of young women (aged 15-34) in 14 Demographic and Health Surveys from seven sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries with generalized HIV epidemics. We measured the degree of similarity in educational attainment (partner homophily) in 75,373 partnerships and evaluated the correlation between homophily and female HIV prevalence at the survey cluster level. We then used logistic regression to assess whether own and partner educational attainment was associated with HIV serostatus amongst 38,791 women.Results: Educational attainment was positively correlated within partnerships in both urban and rural areas of every survey (Newman assortativity coefficients between 0.09 and 0.44), but this correlation was not ecologically associated with HIV prevalence. At the individual level, larger absolute differences between own and partner educational attainment were associated with significantly higher HIV prevalence amongst women. This association was heterogeneous across countries, but not between survey waves. In contrast to other women, for those aged 25 34 who had secondary or higher education, a more-educated partner was associated with lower HIV prevalence.Conclusions: HIV prevalence amongst women in SSA is associated not only with one's own education but also with that of one's partner. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how partners place individuals at risk of infection and suggest that HIV prevention efforts may benefit from considering partner characteristics.",
Opinion formation and bi-polarization with biased assimilation and homophily,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Feb 15 2016,2016,"An agent-based model incorporating biased assimilation is proposed in this paper to investigate opinion dynamics over a connected social network. The opinion of each agent is represented by a sequence of arguments, and it evolves through the interactions between agents. The probability that one agent chooses another to communicate depends on the similarity of their opinions. During every interaction, interacting agents exchange the argument randomly selected from the corresponding arguments sequence. Theoretical analysis reveals that this model results in consensus on either extreme positive opinion or extreme negative opinion, or generates bi-polarization. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamics of the model over different networks. Results are obtained in terms of the effect of homophily, biased assimilation and network topology on opinion formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
A geometric graph model for coauthorship networks,JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS,Feb 2016,2016,"Modeling coauthorship networks helps to understand the emergence and propagation of thoughts in academic society. A random geometric graph is proposed to model coauthor ship networks, the connection mechanism of which expresses the effects of the academic influences and homophily of authors, and the collaborations between research teams. Our analysis reveals that the modeled networks have a range of features of empirical coauthor ship networks, namely, the degree distribution made up of a mixture Poisson distribution with a power-law tail, clear community structure, small-world, high clustering, and degree assortativity. Moreover, the underlying formulae of the tail and forepart of the degree distribution, and the tail of the scaling relation between local clustering coefficient and degree are derived for the modeled networks, and are also applicable to the empirical networks.

Psychological pathways from social integration to health: An examination of different demographic groups in Canada,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Feb 2016,2016,"Rationale: The health effects of social integration have been extensively studied, yet the underlying dynamics of this relationship deserves more exploration. One of the important hypothesized pathways through which social integration affects health is psychological functioning, including a sense of belonging, personal control and generalized trust.Objective: Using a Canadian national survey, this study explored the effect of social integration on different health outcomes via psychological pathways, while incorporating network homophily as a predictor in the model.Methods: Five distinct demographic groups of Canadians (the Native-born Whites, Native-born visible minorities, the Aboriginal people, immigrant Whites and immigrant visible minorities) were compared on their social integration, psychological functioning, and health outcomes. Structural equation models tested the mediation effects of psychological pathways, and group differences were explored by adding interaction terms.Results: The study found that visible minority immigrants were least socially integrated, and the Aboriginal people had the poorest self-reported physical and mental health. Although the Aboriginal people had large networks and active network interactions, they showed stronger ethnic and linguistic homophily in their network formation than the two visible minority groups. Structural equation model results supported the mediated relationship between social integration and health via psychological pathways. A positive effect of friendship ethnic homophily on health was identified and explored.Conclusion: Policy makers may seek opportunities to create social environments that facilitate social interactions and formation of social ties and provide support for programs serving ethnic and immigrant groups.

Homogeneity of personal values and personality traits in Facebook social networks,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PERSONALITY,Feb 2016,2016,"Focusing on similarity of personal values and of personality traits, we investigated who is friends with whom in Facebook friendships. A Facebook application administered questionnaires and retrieved data on whom in our sample of 3348 participants were friends. On average, participants had 8.7 friends within our sample. People similar to each other, either regarding personal values or personality traits, tended to be friends. Moreover, the effect of similarity was not evenly distributed across the value or trait continuums. Those scoring high on Openness to Change or Self-Transcendence values were more likely to be friends with people sharing these values. Regarding personality, those high in Emotional Stability or Openness to Experience, or low in Extraversion, tended to have similar friends. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Does Community-Driven Development Improve Inclusiveness in Peasant Organizations? - Evidence from Senegal,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,Feb 2016,2016,"Using panel village census data from Senegal, we assess the impact of a decentralized agricultural development program the Programme de Services Agricoles et Organisations de Producteurs (PSAOP) on membership and assortative matching in community-based organizations (CBOs). We find that channeling agricultural assistance through CBOs makes these organizations more inclusive in the sense that several tradition-bound assortative matching patterns are broken: homophily in ethnicity and wealth are reduced. Traditionally marginalized groups such as men of nomadic background, women with small landholdings and little education and those residing in female-headed households become CBO members whereas the position of previous CBO leaders is not reinforced. Similarly, those households that received services from a CBO before the PSAOP was in place are less likely to stay. This leads to more heterogeneous CBOs and is in line with the terms and conditions of the program. On the other hand, the likelihood of CBO membership is reduced in project villages, with significant differences between men and women. Women disproportionately drop out of CBOs which receive PSAOP benefits. We conclude that for grassroots-level development projects to be successful, contextual factors need to be integrated into program design and implementation, since they shape local participation. Understanding local power relations and the potential for changing preferences due to external support are key to inclusive participation and development at the local. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Skill complementarity enhances heterophily in collaboration networks,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Jan 8 2016,2016,"Much empirical evidence shows that individuals usually exhibit significant homophily in social networks. We demonstrate, however, skill complementarity enhances heterophily in the formation of collaboration networks, where people prefer to forge social ties with people who have professions different from their own. We construct a model to quantify the heterophily by assuming that individuals choose collaborators to maximize utility. Using a huge database of online societies, we find evidence of heterophily in collaboration networks. The results of model calibration confirm the presence of heterophily. Both empirical analysis and model calibration show that the heterophilous feature is persistent along the evolution of online societies. Furthermore, the degree of skill complementarity is positively correlated with their production output. Our work sheds new light on the scientific research utility of virtual worlds for studying human behaviors in complex socioeconomic systems.",
"Seed exchange networks, ethnicity, and sorghum diversity",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jan 5 2016,2016,"Recent studies investigating the relationship between crop genetic diversity and human cultural diversity patterns showed that seed exchanges are embedded in farmers' social organization. However, our understanding of the social processes involved remains limited. We investigated how farmers' membership in three major social groups interacts in shaping sorghum seed exchange networks in a cultural contact zone on Mount Kenya. Farmers are members of residence groups at the local scale and of dialect groups clustered within larger ethnolinguistic units at a wider scale. The Chuka and Tharaka, who are allied in the same ethnolinguistic unit, coexist with the Mbeere dialect group in the study area. We assessed farmers' homophily, propensity to exchange seeds with members of the same group, using exponential random graph models. We showed that homophily is significant within both residence and ethnolinguistic groups. At these two levels, homophily is driven by the kinship system, particularly by the combination of patrilocal residence and ethnolinguistic endogamy, because most seeds are exchanged among relatives. Indeed, residential homophily in seed exchanges results from local interactions between women and their in-law family, whereas at a higher level, ethnolinguistic homophily is driven by marriage endogamy. Seed exchanges and marriage ties are interrelated, and both are limited between the Mbeere and the other groups, although frequent between the Chuka and Tharaka. The impact of these social homophily processes on crop diversity is discussed.",
Christianity and Implicit Racism in the U.S. Moral and Human Economy,OPEN THEOLOGY,Jan 2016,2016,"The relationship between Christianity and racism in the United States has a long history. In an age of 'multiculturalism' and 'colour-blind' ideology, explicit forms of racism have become less conspicuous. Still, disparities arise across the country's human economy, and explicit statements of egalitarianism are incongruent with practices of discrimination in U.S. Christian churches. This article explores this incongruence and the relationship between Christianity and implicit forms of racism. By discussing theological individualism and the principle of 'homophily', the article contributes to discussions about the relationship between the moral and human economy. Through this, a Christian morality of salvific aspiration is translated into a morality of personal economic responsibility and duty.",

The results are of particular importance for the development of technology that aims at reducing social isolation for people with less chances to interact, such as older adults.",
RELATIONS AND AREAS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN LANDOWNERS IN A PERI-URBAN AREA,METROPOLITAN RURALITIES,2016,2016,"While land management can be a subject of conflict in places where the composition of landowners is socially and culturally diverse, it also holds the potential of bringing landowners together across social groups. This chapter uses the case of a peri-urban area near Copenhagen, Denmark, to examine the relations landowners have through their use and management of land within and across social groups. To elaborate the analysis and discussion of social groups, social coherence and fragmentation, this chapter introduces the concepts of homophily and self-categorisation. Interviews with 40 landowners from two parishes addressed four types of land-based relations: (1) exchange of help and services; (2) debate of farming/management; (3) shared interests and (4) friendship. While the pattern of relations overall supported the idea that people interact more with their own social group, the analysis also showed areas of interaction across groups as well. Three overall themes summarise important areas of cohesion/fragmentation: (1) Rented land and contracting, (2) Common interests between landowners including hunting, farming and horses, (3) Urgency and geographic proximity.",
Factors influencing Generation Y consumers' perceptions of eWOM credibility: a study of the fast-food industry,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMER RESEARCH,2016,2016,"eWOM communication is certainly one of the most influential drivers of purchase decisions. However, little knowledge is available on the factors that influence the trustworthiness and credibility of eWOM communication. To address this research gap, the study aimed to assess whether the three independent variables (homophily, authority and interestingness) have a significant positive indirect effect on eWOM credibility, as mediated by source trustworthiness. The context of the study was fast-food retailers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted and the target population included all Generation Y consumers that visited the fast-food market leaders in Gauteng province, the economic hub of South Africa. Lisrel version 8.8 was used to analyse the results obtained from a realised sample of 362 respondents and to compile the structural equation model. The findings of the study support the research hypotheses formulated and offer a theoretical contribution by enhancing knowledge of the relationships between the variables investigated as well as the factors that could influence eWOM credibility. The study also has meaning to fast-food retailers, as the model could be applied to formulate appropriate strategies and influence the online conversations and perceptions of consumers.",

Integrating Relationships and Attributes: A Model of Multilayer Networks,2016 IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE IN CYBERSPACE (DSC 2016),2016,2016,"Various network relationships in many complex social systems can be described effectively by multilayer networks, but we find that there are interactions between individuals attributes and their social relationships by a principle of homophily, which hence impact the process of information spread and social influence in complex social systems. In order to integrate individuals relationships and attributes in complex social systems effectively, we extract the hidden information of individuals attributes to build a relationships-attributes-based model of multi-layer networks. Proposing that using information entropy which satisfies the conditions of degree distribution and community features to evaluate information values for each network in the multilayer networks, we construct a more reasonable integrated network to solve the problems of data compression reduction of multilayer networks. In addition, we analyze the relationships-attributes-based multilayer networks from the perspectives of the structure of the multilayer networks and the structure of the integrated network on two empirical data. The results verify the correlation between attribute networks and relationship networks, and give more insights into the importance of the proposed relationships-attributes-based model of multilayer networks and the positive role of the integrated network in synthesizing the relationships-attributes-based multilayer networks.",
Hybrid Community Detection Approach in Multilayer Social Network: Scientific Collaboration Recommendation Case Study,2016 IEEE/ACS 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (AICCSA),2016,2016,"Within real-world social networks people are linked with multiple types of relationships, which brings new challenges in community detection for multilayer social network where each layer represents one type of relationships. However, most of existing approaches consist on transforming the problem into a classical problem of community detection in monoplex network. In this work, we propose a new hybrid community detection approach in multilayer social networks. This approach considers simultaneously the network structure (different social connections) and the homophily of participants (similarities between users). To do so we propose a new multiplex information graph model to represent multilayer social network. Then, we adapt a combined community detection algorithm to the multiplex case. Furthermore, an example in the field of scientific collaboration recommendation is given to illustrate the practical usefulness of the proposed approach. Finally, a comparison with other community detection approaches evaluates its performance.",

Different from existing friendship-oriented user recommendation approaches, we exploit user interest homophily to recommend users of similar interests, combining the users' social network as well as their topical interests. We first profile users with social links and topical interests derived from ""re-pin paths"". We further design a collaborative filtering strategy for user recommendation based on interest homophily. Experiments on a content curation social network show that our recommendation algorithm based on user interest homophily performs better than recommendation based on user popularity.",

Domain-specific user preference prediction based on multiple user activities,2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA),2016,2016,"Inferring latent user preferences using both structured and unstructured data is an important social computing task. In this paper, we propose a user preference representation based on user activities embedded in unstructured data to better encode the homophily theory. The representation of an individual user is learned using a embedding based method to integrate latent user preferences in social media. The method has the ability to integrate a variety of user activities based cues from user comments, user social network (i.e; follower/followee connections) and user interested topics which are indicated by the topics a user has participated in. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the prediction of each user's favorite team as a part of user preferences in a dataset collected from the Hu-pu basketball discussion forum.(1) Results clearly indicate that our proposed user representation outperforms other user representation baselines. Integrating user social network and user interested topics with user comments can improve the overall performance of user preference prediction.",
Link prediction in the Twitter mention network: impacts of local structure and similarity of interest,2016 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING WORKSHOPS (ICDMW),2016,2016,The creation of social ties is driven by several factors which can arguably be related to individual preferences and to the common social environment of individuals. Effects of homophily and triadic closure mechanisms are claimed to be important in terms of initiating new social interactions and in turn to shape the global social structure. This way they eventually provide some potential to predict the creation of social ties between disconnected people sharing common friends or common subjects of interest. In this paper we analyze a large Twitter data corpus and quantify similarities between people by considering the set of their common friends and the set of their commonly shared hashtags in order to predict mention links among them. We show that these similarity measures are correlated among connected people and that the combination of contextual and local structural features provides better predictions as compared to cases where they are considered separately. These results help us to better understand the evolution of egocentric and global social networks and provide advances in the design of better recommendation systems and resource allocation plans.,
"Homophily, Structure, and Content Augmented Network Representation Learning",2016 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING (ICDM),2016,2016,"Advances in social networking and communication technologies have witnessed an increasing number of applications where data is not only characterized by rich content information, but also connected with complex relationships representing social roles and dependencies between individuals. To enable knowledge discovery from such networked data, network representation learning (NRL) aims to learn vector representations for network nodes, such that off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms can be directly applied. To date, existing NRL methods either primarily focus on network structure or simply combine node content and topology for learning. We argue that in information networks, information is mainly originated from three sources: (1) homophily, (2) topology structure, and (3) node content. Homophily states social phenomenon where individuals sharing similar attributes (content) tend to be directly connected through local relational ties, while topology structure emphasizes more on global connections. To ensure effective network representation learning, we propose to augment three information sources into one learning objective function, so that the interplay roles between three parties are enforced by requiring the learned network representations (1) being consistent with node content and topology structure, and also (2) following the social homophily constraints in the learned space. Experiments on multi-class node classification demonstrate that the representations learned by the proposed method consistently outperform state-of-the-art NRL methods, especially for very sparsely labeled networks.",
A Friend Like Me: Modeling Network Formation in a Location-Based Social Network,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2016,2016,"This article studies the strategic network formation in a location-based social network. We build an empirical model of social link creation that incorporates individual characteristics and pairwise user similarities. Specifically, we define four user proximity measures from biography, geography, mobility, and short messages. To construct proximity from unstructured text information, we build topic models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Using Gowalla data with 385,306 users, 3 million locations, and 35 million check-in records, we empirically estimate the model to find evidence on the homophily effect on network formation. To cope with possible endogeneity issues, we use exogenous weather shocks as our instrumental variables and find the empirical results are robust: network formation decisions are significantly affected by our proximity measures.",
Social and Spatial Clustering of People at Humanitys Largest Gathering,Figshare,2017-02-28,2016,"Macroscopic behavior of scientific and societal systems results from the aggregation of microscopic behaviors of their constituent elements, but connecting the macroscopic with the microscopic in human behavior has traditionally been difficult. Manifestations of homophily, the notion that individuals tend to interact with others who resemble them, have been observed in many small and intermediate size settings. However, whether this behavior translates to truly macroscopic levels, and what its consequences may be, remains unknown. Here, we use call detail records (CDRs) to examine the population dynamics and manifestations of social and spatial homophily at a macroscopic level among the residents of 23 states of India at the Kumbh Mela, a 3-month-long Hindu festival. We estimate that the festival was attended by 61 million people, making it the largest gathering in the history of humanity. While we find strong overall evidence for both types of homophily for residents of different states, participants from low-representation states show considerably stronger propensity for both social and spatial homophily than those from high-representation states. These manifestations of homophily are amplified on crowded days, such as the peak day of the festival, which we estimate was attended by 25 million people. Our findings confirm that homophily, which here likely arises from social influence, permeates all scales of human behavior. Copyright: CC BY",
Measure of Node Similarity in Multilayer Networks,Figshare,2017-02-28,2016,"The weight of links in a network is often related to the similarity of the nodes. Here, we introduce a simple tunable measure for analysing the similarity of nodes across different link weights. In particular, we use the measure to analyze homophily in a group of 659 freshman students at a large university. Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom data collection software, complemented by questionnaire-based data. The network of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face contacts. We find that even strongly connected individuals are not more similar with respect to basic personality traits than randomly chosen pairs of individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels of acquaintanceships. Copyright: CC BY",
Institutions and Cultural Diversity: Effects of Democratic and Propaganda Processes on Local Convergence and Global Diversity,Figshare,2017-02-28,2016,"In a connected world where people influence each other, what can cause a globalized monoculture, and which measures help to preserve the coexistence of cultures? Previous research has shown that factors such as homophily, population size, geography, mass media, and type of social influence play important roles. In the present paper, we investigate for the first time the impact that institutions have on cultural diversity. In our first three studies, we extend existing agent-based models and explore the effects of institutional influence and agent loyalty. We find that higher institutional influence increases cultural diversity, while individuals' loyalty to their institutions has a small, preserving effect. In three further studies, we test how bottom-up and top-down processes of institutional influence impact our model. We find that bottom-up democratic practices, such as referenda, tend to produce convergence towards homogeneity, while top-down information dissemination practices, such as propaganda, further increase diversity. In our last modelan integration of bottom-up and top-down processes into a feedback loop of informationwe find that when democratic processes are rare, the effects of propaganda are amplified, i.e., more diversity emerges; however, when democratic processes are common, they are able to neutralize or reverse this propaganda effect. Importantly, our models allow for control over the full spectrum of diversity, so that a manipulation of our parameters can result in preferred levels of diversity, which will be useful for the study of other factors in the future. We discuss possible mechanisms behind our results, applications, and implications for political and social sciences. Copyright: CC BY",
"Adolescent Substance Use, Aggressive Behaviors, and Peer Context Behavioral Norms",JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE EDUCATION AND PSYCHOLOGY,2016,2016,"The goal of this study was to examine behavioral norm effects in 2 peer contexts (classroom, school) on adolescent substance use (tobacco, alcohol, cannabis) and aggressive behaviors (bullying, physical fighting). Participants were 5,642 adolescents (M-age = 14.29 years, SD = 1.26; 49% boys). There were 3 hypotheses. First, behavioral norms in both contexts affect individual behavior. Second, classroom norms have stronger effects on individual behavior than school norms. Third, classroom and school norms interact and exacerbate each other's influence. Results indicated that classroom norms had stronger effects than school norms on individual tobacco and alcohol use. Furthermore, school norms had equal or stronger effects than classroom norms on the 2 indicators of aggressive behaviors. There was no evidence for an interaction between classroom and school norms for any dependent variable. This study demonstrates that the complexity of multiple (nested) peer contexts should be considered to fully understand peer influence processes.",

Investigating Regional Prejudice in China Through the Lens of Weibo,"SOCIAL INFORMATICS, PT II",2016,2016,"Regional prejudice is prevalent in Chinese cities where native residents and migrants from other parts of China lack mutual trust. Weibo users actively discuss and argue about the issue of migration, which provides a good source of data to examine the communication network regarding regional prejudice. We are interested in the posts and reposts related to the topic on migrants. In a Weibo repost, one can add new content in addition to the original post. Then both original and new content as a whole can be read by others. In particular, we focus on the reposts in response to native residents' complaints about migrants. Based on the sentiment (negative or non-negative) and the direction (native resident -> migrant or migrant -> native resident), we classify the reposts into four categories. We find evidence of homophily in regional prejudice in the Weibo communication network: 72.7% of the time, native residents' complaints trigger more complaints from other native residents. What interests us most are the socioeconomic factors that can reverse the sentiment or direction of the original posts. A multinomial regression model of the reposting patterns reveals that in a city with better housing security and a larger migrant population, migrant Weibo users are much more likely to argue with native residents who hold a negative view about migrants. One important implication from our findings is that a secure socioeconomic environment facilitates the communication between migrants and native residents and helps break the self-reinforcing loop of regional prejudice.",
TRANSGOVERNMENTAL NETWORKS AND COOPERATION IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH,REVISTA DE CIENCIA POLITICA,2016,2016,"Why do bureaucrats from developing countries cooperate internationally? I argue that international inter-agency cooperation in the Global South results from the need of expert bureaucrats to invest in skill formation when governments do not. When states cut funding, expert bureaucrats cooperate with foreign peers to upgrade their skillsets because career advancement is contingent on up-to-date expertise. To test my theory, I use cross-national co-sponsorship data of projects in nuclear energy, science and technology (NEST) for 69 countries (1980-2008). Results show that bureaucrats cooperate internationally when government spending decreases and that cooperation is more likely to occur among bureaucrats with higher initial skill levels and similar levels of professional development (i.e. homophily). These findings carry implications for the study of global governance in the developing world.",
Trust-based Recommendations through Triadic Closure,"2016 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, SYSTEMS & APPLICATIONS (IISA)",2016,2016,Information filtering and recommender systems exploit various techniques to deal with the information overload problem. One popular technique for making recommendations is based on trust statements between users in a social network. Yet explicit trust statements are usually very sparse leading to the need for expanding the trust networks by inferring new trust relationships. This study proposes a novel model to infer new trusted neighbors and combines it with existing methods to achieve a fully expanded trust network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.,
Communication Constraints and Motivations in the Context of Knowledge Sharing: A Systematic Literature Review,2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT (IEEM),2016,2016,"Innovation and product development activities in firms in almost all countries rely on the product development teams comprised of across functions. The members of product development team are those coming from various backgrounds, across departments and across areas of science.In many product development projects, team members do not always collaborate as expected due to differences in views and poor communication. This Systematic Literature Review explored what factors are inhibitining and motivate product development teams in their communication to share knowledge. Based on the review of 34 relevant articles, this paper presents five factors which inhibit the team members to communicate (functional diversity, homophily, knowledge hoarding, organizational culture, centralization) and five factors which motivate the team members to communicate (reward system, organizational culture, trust, colocated, technology).",
An Overview of Diffusion in Complex Networks,COMPLEX NETWORKS AND DYNAMICS: SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INTERACTIONS,2016,2016,"We survey a series of theoretical contributions on diffusion in random networks. We start with a benchmark contagion process, referred in the epidemiology literature as the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model, which describes the spread of an infectious disease in a population. To make this model tractable, the interaction structure is considered as a heterogeneous sampling process characterized by the degree distribution. Within this framework, we distinguish between the case of unbiased-degree networks and biased-degree networks. We focus on the characterization of the diffusion threshold; that is, a condition on the primitives of the model that guarantees the spreading of the product to a significant fraction of the population, and its persistence. We also extend the analysis introducing a general diffusion model with features that are more appropriate for describing the diffusion of a new product, idea, behavior, etc.",
An Overview of the Measurement of Segregation: Classical Approaches and Social Network Analysis,COMPLEX NETWORKS AND DYNAMICS: SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INTERACTIONS,2016,2016,"We present a comprehensive overview of the literature on the measurement on segregation. With a focus on the evenness and exposure dimensions-two of the five dimensions of segregation in the multi-dimensional framework defined by Massey and Denton (Soc Forces 67(2):281-315, 1988)-we introduce some of the most relevant segregation measures developed under the classical statistical approach and under the social networks analysis framework. We also briefly describe two different approaches for the definition of segregation measures when using social networks, namely the use of descriptive graph statistics and the use of spectral graph theory.",

A picture is worth a thousand words: an empirical study on the influence of content visibility on diffusion processes within a virtual world,BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,2016,2016,"Studying information diffusion and the spread of goods in the real world and in many digital services can be extremely difficult since information about the information flows is challenging to accurately track. How information spreads has commonly been analysed from the perspective of homophily, social influence, and initial seed selection. However, in virtual worlds and virtual economies, the movements of information and goods can be precisely tracked. Therefore, these environments create laboratories for the accurate study of information diffusion characteristics that have been difficult to study in prior research. In this paper, we study how content visibility as well as sender and receiver characteristics, the relationship between them, and the types of multilayer social network layers affect content absorption and diffusion in virtual world. The results show that prior visibility of distributed content is the strongest predictor of content adoption and its further spread across networks. Among other analysed factors, the mechanics of diffusion, content quality, and content adoption by users' neighbours on the social activity layer had very strong influences on the adoption of new content.",
#ISISisNotIslam or #DeportAllMuslims? Predicting Unspoken Views,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 ACM WEB SCIENCE CONFERENCE (WEBSCI'16),2016,2016,"This paper examines the effect of online social network interactions on future attitudes. Specifically, we focus on how a person's online content and network dynamics can be used to predict future attitudes and stances in the aftermath of a major event. In this study, we focus on the attitudes of US Twitter users towards Islam and Muslims subsequent to the tragic Paris terrorist attacks that occurred on November 13, 2015. We quantitatively analyze 44K users' network interactions and historical tweets to predict their attitudes. We provide a description of the quantitative results based on the content (hashtags) and network interaction (retweets, replies, and mentions). We analyze two types of data: (1) we use post-event tweets to learn users' stated stances towards Muslims based on sampling methods and crowd-sourced annotations; and (2) we employ pre-event interactions on Twitter to build a classifier to predict post-event stances. We found that pre-event network interactions can predict someone's attitudes towards Muslims with 82% macro F-measure, even in the absence of prior mentions of Islam, Muslims, or related terms.",

This study explores the prevalence of Facebook groups associated with courses from MITx and HarvardX, the geographic distribution of students in such groups as compared to the courses at large, and the extent to which such groups are location and/or language homophilous. Results suggests that a non-trivial number of MOOC students engage in Facebook groups, that learners from a number of non-U.S. locations are disproportionately likely to participate in such groups, and that the groups display both location and language homophily. These findings have implications for how MOOCs and social media platforms can support learners from non-English speaking contexts.",
How user personality and social value orientation influence avatar-mediated friendship,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE,2016,2016,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of user personality and vlaues on the number of connections users make, the number of requests for connections that users give out, and the number of connections invitations users receive.Design/methodology/approach - This is a field study of 179 participants interacting in a novel virtual world. The world's server logs are used to capture sociometrics about the users and their interaction.Findings - Findings suggest that personality and values influence the number of friends users make and the number of friendship requests users give out, but not the number of friendship invitations users receive. Only one personality trait - conscientiousness - exhibits homophily.Originality/value - Perosnality and social value orientation have rarely been studied together in information systems (IS) research, despite research showing the two have an impact on IS relevant constructs. The use of server logs for data capture is novel. Avatar friendship is an under-researched concept in IS.",
Professional Community of Coaching Practice: Rhythmic Gymnastics Coaches' Social Network,Korean Journal of Sport Science,2016,2016,"Previous work has shown that coaches sought information from several sources; however, there was a strong reliance on learning from other coaches within their social networks. There has been limited research examining the nature of these social networks with other coaches (Trudel and Gilbert 2004). Thus the purpose of this study was to examine the structures of coaches’ social networks of Korean rhythmic gymnasts. Research questions were: (1) What are the network structures of Korean rhythmic gymnasts’ coaches? (2) What structural parameters contribute to coaches’ network structures, and (3) Is there an association between coaches’ network and flow of information in their networks? A total of 37 coaches of youth rhythmic gymnasts (6-18 years old) participated in this study. Each of those coaches was asked to complete a Name Generator Questionnaire (i.e., list four names that you have a close relationship with) and general socio-demographic survey. Data were analyzed using social network analysis tools such as UCINET, p-net, and Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Analysis of network centrality, density, and strong components showed that (1) homophily was identified in the structure of coaches’ social networks (2) homophily (e.g., by gymnasts’ ranking, mentor coaches) contributed to the total social network of coaches, and (3) interacting only with close coaches in the network, coaches received information about coaches/coaching from the strong ties rather than weak ties (Granovetter, 1973). This study also has strong links to Wenger’s (1998) community of practice which posited that groups of people share a common characteristic in practice.",

Research performance and degree centrality in co-authorship networks The moderating role of homophily,ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,2016,2016,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the relationship between a scholar's research performance (using weighted journal-impact factor average) and their degree centrality; the impact of author-homophily (in terms of gender, institutional sector, academic age, academic ranks, province and city) on this relationship is investigated as well.Design/methodology/approach - Using scientific publishing data and journal-impact factors from Thomson Reuters' ISI Web of Science (SCI) and Journal Citation Reports, respectively, the domestic co-authorship network of chemistry researchers in Pakistan during 2002-2009 was constructed then modeled via ordinary least squares regression.Findings - Results show that the personal characteristics of a researcher do not necessarily lead to high degree centrality, i. e. attributes may not be causal to co-author relationships. Instead, high degree centrality is more so a function of the forerunning research performance of the researcher: those whom publish more in terms of impact factor, attract more co-authors (high degree centrality). Moreover, the relationship between research performance and degree centrality is positively moderated by age and province homophily and negatively moderated by city homophily.Research limitations/implications - Data are sourced wholly from the Pakistani chemistry research community; results many not be generalizable to other sub-populations or the wider research community.Practical implications - The findings provide insights to performance-seeking authors: knowing that their research performance enhances their centrality, which in-turn may lead to increased research performance and various other desirable professional outcomes. In addition, researchers can look toward establishing similar (homophilous) or dissimilar (heterophilous) ties knowing that the relationship between research performance and centrality will likely be stronger when similarity or dissimilarity exists.Social implications - This study supports the idea that high research performance attracts more potential co-authors, which in-turn may lead to ever greater research performance, which suggests that the research community will be fragmented between high-and low-performing researchers. Also researcher will have similar or dissimilar ties in terms of various characteristics which in turn moderate the research performance centrality relationship.Originality/value - This paper counteracts the empirical belief that researchers are attractive as potential co-authors according to their personal and professional characteristics. It is actually their research performance and homophily or heterophily of their ties which matters.",
Personality Homophily and the Local Network Characteristics of Facebook,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING ASONAM 2016,2016,2016,"Social networks are known to form on the basis of homophily, where nodes with some type of similar characteristics are more likely to be connected. Some of the most fundamental human characteristics are reflected by an individual's personality, which represents a persistent disposition governing a human's outlook and approach to diverse situations. While taking into account demographics of age and gender, we assess the extent to which personality homophily is evident in the local network features of Facebook. Using a large sample obtained from the MyPersonality dataset, we find that a range of network-based features correlate with personality facets of individuals. In particular, extraversion had a positive effect on an individual's network size, while neuroticism had a negative effect. Additionally, extraversion and openness were positively related to transitivity, which was moderated by gender. Finally, we found that conscientiousness, agreeableness and extraversion were homophilous: people with higher similarity on these facets were more strongly connected. This was additionally mediated by gender for agreeableness: personality similarity had an effect for male-only and mixed pairs, but not for female-only pairs. Personality similarity was also stronger among closed triangles, compared to open ones. These results support the idea that inherent attraction between individuals, on the basis of personality, drives the roles we play within our online social networks.",
A Hybrid Statistical and Semantic Model for Identification of Mental Health and Behavioral Disorders using Social Network Analysis,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING ASONAM 2016,2016,2016,"The advent of social networking and open health web forums such as PatientsLikeMe, WebMD, ehealth forum etc. have provided avenues for social user data that can prove instrumental in suggesting futuristic trends in healthcare. Homophily in social networks is a vital contributor for analyzing patterns for medical conditions, diagnosis and treatment options. Since, members with similar medical issues contribute to a common discussion pool; this offers a rich source of information that can be utilized. This paper intends to explore growing trends in Mental Health and Behavioral Studies (MHB) which lays emphasis on co-existing conditions resulting in comorbidity. We present a novel approach where personality traits inferred from unstructured text of patients and general social users are compared via statistical analysis. This is achieved by our Psychiatric Disorder Determination (PDD) algorithm. Further, Social media data of users showing personality traits of patients is subjected to semantic based text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Ontology Based Information Extraction (OBIE) in our Addiction Category Determination (ACD) algorithm. This provides categorization of user journals to common topics of discussion by referring to ontologies DBpedia, Freebase and YAGO2s. The final category hence obtained can be predicted to be a trending subject of concern for users with Psychiatric disorders developing Addictive behavioral personalities.",

Embracing Cultural Diversity: Online Social Ties in Distributed Workgroups,ACM CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK AND SOCIAL COMPUTING (CSCW 2016),2016,2016,"Cross-cultural network ties have been shown to improve decision-making, creativity, conflict-resolution and use of collaborative technologies. Nevertheless, cultural barriers are difficult to overcome. We used data from an internal Social Networking System (SNS) in a large global company to see if membership in the same company might reduce the effect of cultural homophily. We found no effect. However, when we focused on members of 87 distributed workgroups, we found that the effect of cultural differences actually reversed, indicating greater cultural diversity in online friendship ties than observed in the company at large. We discuss alternative explanations for this finding and the implications for work environments in global companies.",
Distinguishing between Personal Preferences and Social Influence in Online Activity Feeds,ACM CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK AND SOCIAL COMPUTING (CSCW 2016),2016,2016,"Many online social networks thrive on automatic sharing of friends' activities to a user through activity feeds, which may influence the user's next actions. However, identifying such social influence is tricky because these activities are simultaneously impacted by influence and homophily. We propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and observational data about people's actions to estimate the extent of copy-influence-mimicking others' actions that appear in a feed. We assume that non-friends don't influence users; thus, comparing how a user's activity correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can help tease out the effect of copy-influence.Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates that don't account for homophily overestimate copy-influence by varying, often large amounts. Further, copy-influence estimates fall below 1% of total actions in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not affected by the feed. Our results question common perceptions around the extent of copy-influence in online social networks and suggest improvements to diffusion and recommendation models.",
"Social Association and Social Inequality in Poland, 1988-2013",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,2016,2016,"The present study contributes to the study of educational and occupational homophily in marital and friendship relations in Poland. Using data from the most recent installment of an ongoing longitudinal study, the article adds to the existing body of findings on the topic and also (a) applies a novel conceptual framework to the data to obtain estimates of homophily for the different characteristics and relations, and (b) tests hypotheses specifying a link between the amount of homophily and the overall degree of inequality. The conceptual framework models homophily in terms of the probability that a member of a given group will reject an out-group member as an associate. The hypotheses build on work on the so-called Matthew effect by Slomczynski et al. (2007) and a theoretical argument derived from status and exchange theories. Empirical analyses presented in the second part of the study suggest that there has been some change in the degree of homophily, but the magnitude of that change depends on the distance separating the categories: while the estimates of the rejection probabilities for relations between distant categories are more or less stable across the period under study, we observe a decrease in homophily in social associations between categories that are close to one another in the social hierarchy.",
Data Portraits and Intermediary Topics: Encouraging Exploration of Politically Diverse Profiles,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES (IUI'16),2016,2016,"In micro-blogging platforms, people connect and interact with others. However, due to cognitive biases, they tend to interact with like-minded people and read agreeable information only. Many efforts to make people connect with those who think differently have not worked well. In this paper, we hypothesize, first, that previous approaches have not worked because they have been direct - they have tried to explicitly connect people with those having opposing views on sensitive issues. Second, that neither recommendation or presentation of information by themselves are enough to encourage behavioral change. We propose a platform that mixes a recommender algorithm and a visualization-based user interface to explore recommendations. It recommends politically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and displays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's personal content. We performed an ""in the wild"" evaluation of this platform, and found that people explored more recommendations when using a biased algorithm instead of ours. In line with our hypothesis, we also found that the mixture of our recommender algorithm and our user interface, allowed politically interested users to exhibit an unbiased exploration of the recommended profiles. Finally, our results contribute insights in two aspects: first, which individual differences are important when designing platforms aimed at behavioral change; and second, which algorithms and user interfaces should be mixed to help users avoid cognitive mechanisms that lead to biased behavior.",
A Preference-Driven Database Approach to Reciprocal User Recommendations in Online Social Networks,"DATABASE AND EXPERT SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS, DEXA 2016, PT II",2016,2016,"Online Social Networks (OSN) are frequently used to find people with common interests, though such functionality is often based on mechanisms such as friends-of-friends that do not perform well for real life interactions. We demonstrate an integrated database-driven recommendation approach that determines reciprocal user matches, which is an important feature to reduce the risk of rejection. Similarity is computed in a data-adaptive way based on dimensions such as homophily, propinquity, and recommendation context. By representation of dimensions as unique preference database queries, user models can be created in an intuitive way and can be directly evaluated on datasets. Query results serve as input for a reciprocal recommendation process that handles various similarity measures. Performance benchmarks conducted with data of a commercial outdoor platform prove the applicability to reallife tasks.",

We examined a communication network of 71 health professionals in four professional roles: physician, nurse, health management, and support personnel (dietitian, pharmacist, or social worker), or other health professionals (including physical, respiratory, and occupational therapists, and medical students) working in a burn unit. Data for this cross-sectional study were collected by surveying members of a healthcare team. Ties were defined by asking team members whom they discussed patient care matters with on the shift. We built an exponential random graph model to determine: (1) does professional role influence the likelihood of a tie; (2) are ties more likely between team members from different professions compared to between team members from the same profession; and (3) which professions are more likely to form interprofessional ties. Health management and support personnel ties were 94% interprofessional while ties among nurses were 60% interprofessional. Nurses and other health professionals were significantly less likely than physicians to form ties. Nurses were 1.64 times more likely to communicate with nurses than non-nurses (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.01-2.66); there was no significant role homophily for physicians, other health professionals, or health management and support personnel. Understanding communication networks in healthcare teams is an early step in understanding how teams work together to provide care; future work should evaluate the types and quality of interactions between members of interprofessional healthcare teams.",
Hierarchy of Knowledge Translation: From Health Problems to Ad-Hoc Drug Design,CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,2016,2016,"An innovative approach to analyze the complexity of translating novel molecular entities and nanomaterials into pharmaceutical alternatives (i.e., knowledge translation, KT) is discussed. First, some key concepts on the organization and translation of the biomedical knowledge (paradigms, homophily, power law distributions, hierarchy, modularity, and research fronts) are reviewed. Then, we propose a model for the knowledge translation (KT) in Drug Discovery that considers the complexity of interdisciplinary communication.Specifically, we address two highly relevant aspects: 1) A successful KT requires the emergence of organized bodies of inter-and transdisciplinary research, and 2) The hierarchical and modular topological organization of these bodies of knowledge. We focused on a set of previously-published studies on KT which rely on a combination of network analysis and computer-assisted analysis of the contents of scientific literature and patents. The selected studies provide a duo of complementary perspectives: the demand of knowledge (cervical cancer and Ebola hemorrhagic fever) and the supply of knowledge (liposomes and nanoparticles to treat cancer and the paradigmatic Doxil, the first nano-drug to be approved).",
Ranking Features in Facebook to Detect Overlapping Communities,"2016 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKING, SENSING, AND CONTROL (ICNSC)",2016,2016,"Attributed social networks includes not only the network structure but also features of the nodes. The huge data in social networks has increased the risk of false discoveries, identifying communities in Facebook requires simple but effective fast techniques. Existing community detection methods suffer from high computational cost caused by both huge structure (nodes) and attribute dimensionality.Based on the homophily property of social networks, that linked nodes likely share similar attributes, we propose a new approach to rank attributes of a social network, called RELNA. Then we detect communities using only high ranked attributes instead of all, therefore, the computation time can be reduced dramatically. Comparisons between RELNA and LINKREC (a well-known attribute ranking algorithm) were made through experiments on Facebook data sets, the results are almost the same. Furthermore, we use the obtained top relevant attributes on CESNA algorithm (an well known overlapping community detection algorithm) to detect communities, results show that our approach is much faster meanwhile cluster precision keeps almost the same as CESNA.",
Dynamics of Evolving Social Groups,EC'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 ACM CONFERENCE ON ECONOMICS AND COMPUTATION,2016,2016,"Exclusive social groups are ones in which the group members decide whether or not to admit a candidate to the group. Examples of exclusive social groups include academic departments and fraternal organizations. In the present paper we introduce an analytic framework for studying the dynamics of exclusive social groups. In our model, every group member is characterized by his opinion, which is represented as a point on the real line. The group evolves in discrete time steps through a voting process carried out by the group's members. Due to homophily, each member votes for the candidate who is more similar to him (i.e., closer to him on the line). An admission rule is then applied to determine which candidate, if any, is admitted. We consider several natural admission rules including majority and consensus.We ask: how do different admission rules affect the composition of the group in the long term? We study both growing groups (where new members join old ones) and fixed-size groups (where new members replace those who quit). Our analysis reveals intriguing phenomena and phase transitions, some of which are quite counterintuitive.",
Promoter Homophily in Boards: Does it Really Matter? - An Analysis of Indian Firms,ECONOMICS BULLETIN,2016,2016,"The phenomenon of homophily which suggests that people tend to associate with others having similar traits is observed in many relations including marriage, friendship, work relations, etc. In this paper we provide evidence of homophily in Indian boards with respect to the linguistic affiliation of the promoter. A homophilous board is in effect a less linguistically diverse board. Homophily can lead to fall in diverse perspectives, weak governance and higher risk of decision errors. At the same time homophily also improves communication and coordination among the members of the board and the promoter leading to smooth board functioning. We find that promoter homophily in board is negatively associated with financial performance of firms indicating that the negative channels dominates the positive effects for firms in India. Further, the relation is stronger for the standalone firms vis-a-vis the groups firms suggesting that in emerging market economies the group firms having established reputation and connection with other group firms can partially offset the negative effects of homophily in board. The findings are in support of the research emphasizing the need of board diversity across various dimensions.",
A Temporal-Causal Modelling Approach to Integrated Contagion and Network Change in Social Networks,ECAI 2016: 22ND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,2016,2016,"This paper introduces an integrated adaptive temporal-causal network model for dynamics in networks of social interactions addressing contagion between states, and changing connections within these social networks by two principles: the homophily principle and the more-becomes-more principle. The model has been evaluated in three different manners: by simulation experiments, by verification based on mathematical analysis, and by validation against an empirical data set.",
Detecting Communities Using Coordination Games : A Short Paper,ECAI 2016: 22ND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,2016,2016,"Communities typically capture homophily as people of the same community share many common features. This paper is motivated by the problem of community detection in social networks, as it can help improve our understanding of the network topology. Given the selfish nature of humans to align with like-minded people, we employ game theoretic models and algorithms to detect communities in this paper. Specifically, we employ coordination games to represent interactions between individuals in a social network. We provide a novel and scalable two phased algorithm NashOverlap to compute an accurate overlapping community structure in the given network. We evaluate our algorithm against the best existing methods for community detection and show that our algorithm improves significantly on benchmark networks with respect to standard normalised mutual information measure.",
Explore city dynamics from the communication network between base stations,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS,2016,2016,"With the continuing urbanisation of the world's population, the risk of economic, health and environmental disaster is also increasing. There is an urgent demand for urban planners and governments to understand how people use the city's infrastructure. Recently, as cell phones become more popular, mobile phone data provides an unlimited source of information about the city. In this paper, we build a social network between different base stations and analyse how the places are connected by using a four-day mobile phone dataset, which consists of 17,598,000 records. Particularly, we construct communication network between different parts of the city and analyse the degree distribution of the network and the homophily of the administrative areas. We then use Louvain method to detect the community structure of the network on weekdays and weekends. Our results show that the in-degree and out-degree distribution of the network exhibit a heavy-tailed form and the assortativity by administrative area is strong. The communities found on weekdays and weekends are both spatially contiguous, which implies that whether at work or not, people tend to communicate within a spatially enclosed community.",
Attraction during the service encounter: examining the other side of the coin,JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING,2016,2016,"Purpose - The existing literature dealing with attractiveness during a service encounter focuses on employee attractiveness and its consequences. This paper aims to consider the other side of the coin by focusing on customers' attractiveness.Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of two studies, this paper presents and tests a model explaining the specific role that employee social attraction plays in customer service perception and satisfaction judgment.Findings - It suggests that the appraisal of customers' physical attractiveness and homophily may lead to situations in which employees are socially attracted to customers, thus influencing customer service perception.Originality/value - Consequently, this research provides insights into the role of attraction determinants in a service context. In addition, it demonstrates how employees' social attraction is triggered in a service context. The findings contribute to satisfaction research by extending prior research perceptions on dyadic service encounters and examining both employee attitude and customer perceptions in service interactions.",
A Multifactor Approach to Candidate Image,COMMUNICATION STUDIES,2016,2016,"Decades of communication research have demonstrated that political candidate images are important predictors of electoral success and that campaign communication influences these image perceptions. However, questions remain about the relative importance of various facets of candidate image, how electoral context and partisanship influence the salience of these facets, and whether privileged classes enjoy presumption in image facets that reinforce their dominant position in politics. These questions require a new approach to image research. We propose a multifactor approach that explores the relative importance of six image traits: character, intelligence, leadership, benevolence, homophily, and charm. The benefits of this approach are illustrated through application to two electoral contexts, the 2012 U.S. presidential election and the 2014 U.S. midterm elections.",
Identifying Cohesive Subgroups of Elementary School Students’Friendship Networks and Exploring Academic Help Networks Formation Using Social Network Analysis,Journal of Educational Evaluation,2016,2016,"The purpose of this study is identifying cohesive subgroups of elementary school students's friendship networks and to explore the effects of achievement goals, academic achievement, formal and informal organizations on elementary school students’ academic help networks formation using social network analysis. Specifically, we measured elementary school students’ friendship networks and academic help networks in Gyeonggi province in Spirng(N=273) and Fall(N=259) 2015. Second, we identified cohesive subgroups based on elementary school students’ close friends network and presented sociograms with explanation. Third, we analyzed the effects of formal and informal organizations, achievement goals, academic achievement on academic help networks formation after controlling for gender using p2 models. Firstly, the results of identifying cohesive subgroups indicated that cohesive subgroups consisted of same gender in general, but showed different aspects by grade. Secondly, the results of multilevel p2 models indicated that formal organization(classrooms) and informal organization(cohesive subgroups) were statistically significant and positively related to academic help network formation. Additionally, social mastery goals was statistically positively related to providing academic help, while social performance approach goals was statistically negatively related to providing academic help and social performance approach goals was statistically positively related to receiving academic help. Finally, there was homophily effect of academic achievement on academic help network formation.",
Sympatric Multiculturalism in Opinion Models,BAYESIAN INFERENCE AND MAXIMUM ENTROPY METHODS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,2016,2016,"While social interactions tend to decrease differences in opinions, multiplicity of groups and individual opinion differences persist in human societies. Axelrod identified homophily and social conformity seeking as basic interactions that can lead to multiculturalism in spatial scenarios in models under certain special conditions. We follow another route, where the social interaction between any two agents is given by the descent along the gradient of a cost function deduced from a Bayesian learning formalism. The cost function depends on a hyperparameter that estimates the trust of one agent in the information provided by the other. If the expected value of the total cost function is relevant information, Maximum Entropy permits characterizing the state of the society. Furthermore we introduce a dynamics on the trust parameters, which increases when agents concur and decreases otherwise. We study the resulting phase diagram in the case of large number of interacting agents on a complete social graph, hence under sympatric conditions. Simulations show that there is evolution of assortative distrust in rich cultural environments measured by the diversity of the set of issues under discussions. High distrust leads to antilearning which leads to multiple groups which hold different opinions on the set of issues. We simulate conditions of political pressure and interaction that describe the House of Congress of Brazil and are able to qualitatively replicate voting patterns through four presidential cycles during the years of 1994 to 2010.",
"Peer interaction in rural preschool classrooms: Contributions of children's learning-related behaviors, language and literacy skills, and problem behaviors",EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY,2016,2016,"Peer interaction contributes strongly to children's development and learning, but the processes by which peer interaction is shaped in preschool classrooms, particularly classrooms in rural communities, are largely unknown. This study aimed to examine the patterns of peer interaction in rural preschool classrooms as a way to extrapolate how children influence each other in their day-to-day social interaction. Included in this study were 270 preschoolers (Mean age = 53 months, SD = 3.2) from 61 preschool classrooms located in rural communities that primarily served children from low-income families. Results of actor-partner interdependence models demonstrate significant homophily effects of children's learning related behaviors and language and literacy skills, after accounting for gender and problem behavior homophily. The similarity of learning-related behaviors between a dyad mediated the relationship between their problem behaviors and the frequency of peer interaction. Children's language and literacy skills were similar to the skills of their peers with whom they interacted more often toward the end of the academic year. These findings have implications for understanding and improving peer interaction in rural preschool classrooms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Mining Social Ties Beyond Homophily,2016 32ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING (ICDE),2016,2016,"Summarizing patterns of connections or social ties in a social network, in terms of attributes information on nodes and edges, holds a key to the understanding of how the actors interact and form relationships. We formalize this problem as mining top-k group relationships (GRs), which captures strong social ties between groups of actors. While existing works focus on patterns that follow from the well known homophily principle, we are interested in social ties that do not follow from homophily, thus, provide new insights. Finding top-k GRs faces new challenges: it requires a novel ranking metric because traditional metrics favor patterns that are expected from the homophily principle; it requires an innovative search strategy since there is no obvious anti-monotonicity for such GRs; it requires a novel data structure to avoid data explosion caused by multidimensional nodes and edges and many-to-many relationships in a social network. We address these issues through presenting an efficient algorithm, GRMiner, for mining top-k GRs and we evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency using real data.",
SLR: A Scalable Latent Role Model for Attribute Completion and Tie Prediction in Social Networks,2016 32ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING (ICDE),2016,2016,"Social networks are an important class of networks that span a wide variety of media, ranging from social websites such as Facebook and Google Plus, citation networks of academic papers and patents, caller networks in telecommunications, and hyperlinked document collections such as Wikipedia - to name a few. Many of these social networks now exceed millions of users or actors, each of which may be associated with rich attribute data such as user profiles in social websites and caller networks, or subject classifications in document collections and citation networks. Such attribute data is often incomplete for a number of reasons - for example, users may be unwilling to spend the effort to complete their profiles, while in the case of document collections, there may be insufficient human labor to accurately classify all documents. At the same time, the tie or link information in these networks may also be incomplete - in social websites, users may simply be unaware of potential acquaintances, while in citation networks, authors may be unaware of appropriate literature that should be referenced.Completing and predicting these missing attributes and ties is important to a spectrum of applications, such as recommendation, personalized search, and targeted advertising, yet large social networks can pose a scalability challenge to existing algorithms designed for this task. Towards this end, we propose an integrative probabilistic model, SLR, that captures both attribute and tie information simultaneously, and can be used for attribute completion and tie prediction, in order to enable the above mentioned applications. A key innovation in our model is the use of triangle motifs to represent ties in the network, in order to scale to networks with millions of nodes and beyond. Experiments on real world datasets show that SLR significantly improves the accuracy of attribute prediction and tie prediction compared to well-known methods, and our distributed, multi-machine implementation easily scales up to millions of users. In addition to fast and accurate attribute and tie prediction, we also demonstrate how SLR can identify the attributes most responsible for homophily within the network, thus revealing which attributes drive network tie formation.",
Subgroup Analysis of Global Communication Network on Twitter,The Journal of the Korea Contents Association,2016,2016,"We investigated subgroups within a global communication network to improve the empirical understanding of global communication phenomenon from the social network perspective. We collected global communication data from Twitter and constructed a global communication network. We also added countries’ geographic and economic properties used in the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. We analyzed the subgroups’ structure within the global communication network using centrality analysis, core-peripheral analysis, and cohesion analysis. We also detected communities embedded within the global communication network with modularity-based community detection methods. We found that the core countries occupy central positions in the global communication network and there is a hierarchical communication structure among the economic subgroups. Futhermore, we discovered some communities within the global communication network and found that countries within the communities can have homophily such as economy, geography, history, culture, and religion.",
Multilayer structure formation via homophily and homeostasis,DYNAMICS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN BIOMEDICAL PHOTONICS XIII,2016,2016,"The competition of homophily and homeostasis mechanisms taking place in the multilayer network where several layers of connection topologies are simultaneously present as well as the interaction between layers is considered.

Influence and Sentiment Homophily on Twitter Social Circles,COMPLEX NETWORKS VII,2016,2016,"Web-based social relations mirror several known phenomena identified by Social Sciences, such as Homophily. Social circles are inferable from those relations and there are already solutions to find the underlying sentiment of social interactions. We present an empirical study that combines existing Graph Clustering and Sentiment Analysis techniques for reasoning about Sentiment dynamics at cluster level and analyzing the role of social influence on sentiment contagion, based on a large dataset extracted from Twitter during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Exploiting WebGraph and LAW frameworks to extract clusters, and SentiStrength to analyze sentiment, we propose a strategy for finding moments of Sentiment Homophily in clusters. We found that clusters tend to be neutral for long ranges of time, but denote volatile bursts of sentiment polarity locally over time. In those moments of polarized sentiment homogeneity there is evidence of an increased, but not strong, chance of one sharing the same overall sentiment that prevails in the cluster to which he belongs.",
The Effects of Friends who drink on Adolescent Drinking Onset: Focusing on Social Learning Theory and Friends' Network Effect,Health and Social Science,2016,2016,"The early age of drinking onset is significantly associated with alcohol problem in adulthood. Therefore the alcohol drinking onset during adolescence should be paid more attention and developed further academically. This study aims to investigate the effects of friends who drink to alcohol drinking onset in South Korean adolescences and examine the context of effects within friends network(homophily or diffusion). A 5-year (2003-2007) panel data from Korea Youth Panel Survey (KYPS) were analyzed for this study. And I carried out Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on age of alcohol drinking onset and discrete-time event history analysis to find out a possibility of causal relationship between friends who drink and alcohol drinking onset. The results showed that the survivor function of alcohol drinking onset differs greatly depending on the presence of friends who drink. And based on the discrete-time event history analysis, the effect of friends who drink is strongly associated with alcohol drinking onset. Furthermore, interaction effects between duration (age) and friends who drink are detected. These findings imply that friends who drink within friends effect on learning of drinking and evidence of diffusion within friends network",
A Longitudinal Study of Sex Homophily and its Changes in a Public Organization,Korean Review of Organizational Studies,2016,2016,"Homophily is “the principle that a contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people” (McPherson et al. 2001, p. 416). Using a social network perspective, this study examines the differences in sex homophily, the tendency to form their interpersonal network with those from the same sex (men to men, women to women), and their longitudinal changes in an organization. Using social network data collected longitudinally in an organization with a large infusion of newcomers, this study found that polarization of sex homophily occurs over time as men’s homophily increases while that of women’s decreases. Homophilous ties generally last longer in both men’s and women’s networks. In women’s network, their ties with other women were more likely to survive in women’s informal network, whereas they were more likely to perish in women’s formal network. The results imply that women’s patterns of interaction may change as they seek the resources and support they need during their organizational entry, while homophily among men begins soon after their organizational entry. The findings also suggest that the patterns of sex homophily in a network may be greatly determined by who controls resources in the network. Therefore, the changes that occur in women’s sex homophily patterns may raise another barrier to women’s career development and success.",
Entity resolution in disjoint graphs: An application on genealogical data,INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS,2016,2016,"Entity Resolution (ER) is the process of identifying references referring to the same entity from one or more data sources. In the ER process, most existing approaches exploit the content information of references, categorized as content-based ER, or additionally consider linkage information among references, categorized as context-based ER. However, in new applications of ER, such as in the genealogical domain, the very limited linkage information among references results in a disjoint graph in which the existing content-/context-based ER techniques have very limited applicability. Therefore, in this paper we propose first, to use the homophily principle for augmentation of the original input graph by connecting the potential similar references, and second, to use a Random Walk based approach to consider contextual information available for each reference in the augmented graph. We evaluate the proposed method by applying it to a large genealogical dataset and we succeed to predict 420,000 reference matches with precision 92% and discover six novel and informative patterns among them which can not be detected in the original disjoint graph.",
Like Will to Like? Partner Choice among Muslim Migrants and Natives in Western Europe,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,2016,2016,"The most influential theory on partner choice, from which I will also depart, the theory on assortative mating, starts from the premise that individuals prefer to marry someone who shares certain characteristics denoted by the Greek term 'homophily'. Religious and ethnic homophily are very important in this context. Consequently, this paper looks at marriages between natives and migrants of different origin, which are at the same time interreligious as the focus is on Muslim migrants. Marriages between natives and migrants from countries with a large Muslim majority have been reported as exceptionally low. Further analyses try to find out what is so exceptional about intermarriage between Muslim migrants and natives and devote attention to levels of individual religiosity, conflicting ideas about family life and relationships, premarital sexuality, attitudes about intermarriage and lastly, the role of parents in the matchmaking process. The latter have been understudied in previous research, as it was mostly not able to go beyond socio-demographic variables. My research provides evidence for all of these factors, but in contrast to earlier research, my analyses show for the first time that parental interference and possibly the importance of value transmission through marriage reduce the likelihood to intermarry.",
Socio-spatial affiliation networks,COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS,Jan 1 2016,2016,"Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have recently attracted a lot of attention due to the number of novel services they can offer. Prior work on analysis of LBSNs has mainly focused on the social part of these systems. Even though it is important to know how different the structure of the social graph of an LBSN is as compared to the friendship-based social networks (SNs), it raises the interesting question of what kinds of linkages exist between locations and friendships. The main problem we are investigating is to identify such connections between the social and the spatial planes of an LBSN. In particular, in this paper we focus on answering the following general question ""What are the bonds between the social and spatial information in an LBSN and what are the metrics that can reveal them?"" In order to tackle this problem, we employ the idea of affiliation networks. Analyzing a dataset from a specific LBSN (Gowalla), we make two main interesting observations; (i) the social network exhibits signs of homophily with regards to the ""places/venues"" visited by the users, and (ii) the ""nature"" of the visited venues that are common to users is powerful and informative in revealing the social/spatial linkages. We further show that the ""entropy"" of a venue can be used to better connect spatial information with the existing social relations. The entropy records the diversity of a venue and requires only location history of users (it does not need temporal history). Finally, we provide a simple application of our findings for predicting existing friendship relations based on users' historic spatial information. We show that even with simple unsupervised or supervised learning models we can achieve significant improvement in prediction when we consider features that capture the ""nature"" of the venue as compared to the case where only apparent properties of the location history are used (e.g., number of common visits).

"Homophily, influence and the decay of segregation in self-organizing networks",NETWORK SCIENCE,2016,2016,"We study the persistence of network segregation in networks characterized by the co-evolution of vertex attributes and link structures, in particular where individual vertices form linkages on the basis of similarity with other network vertices (homophily), and where vertex attributes diffuse across linkages, making connected vertices more similar over time (influence). A general mathematical model of these processes is used to examine the relative influence of homophily and influence in the maintenance and decay of network segregation in self-organizing networks. While prior work has shown that homophily is capable of producing strong network segregation when attributes are fixed, we show that adding even minute levels of influence is sufficient to overcome the tendency towards segregation even in the presence of relatively strong homophily processes. This result is proven mathematically for all large networks and illustrated through a series of computational simulations that account for additional network evolution processes. This research contributes to a better theoretical understanding of the conditions under which network segregation and related phenomenon-such as community structure-may emerge, which has implications for the design of interventions that may promote more efficient network structures.",
The impact of user's availability on On-line Ego Networks: a Facebook analysis,COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS,Jan 1 2016,2016,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) are the most popular applications in todays Internet and they have changed the way people interact with each other. Understanding the structural properties of OSNs and, in particular, how users behave when they connect to OSNs is crucial for designing user-centered systems. Results about OSNs demonstrated that the relationships that an individual (ego) maintains with other people (alters) can be organized into a set of circles (named Dunbar's circles) according to the ego network model. The study of the impact of ego networks structure on the availability patterns of users is seriously limited by the lack of information about users availability patterns. In this work we contribute to fill this gap by analysing availability information of a sample of Facebook users. The data reveal a number of strong temporal dependencies (or temporal homophily) which provide insights into the availability pattern that characterize an ego network.

Ethnic Composition and Friendship Segregation: Differential Effects for Adolescent Natives and Immigrants,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Jan 2016,2016,"Ethnically diverse settings provide opportunities for interethnic friendship but can also increase the preference for same-ethnic friendship. Therefore, same-ethnic friendship preferences, or ethnic homophily, can work at cross-purposes with policy recommendations to diversify ethnic representation in social settings. In order to effectively overcome ethnic segregation, we need to identify those factors within diverse settings that exacerbate the tendency toward ethnic homophily. Using unique data and multiple network analyses, the authors examine 529 adolescent friendship networks in English, German, Dutch, and Swedish schools and find that the ethnic composition of school classes relates differently to immigrant and native homophily. Immigrant homophily disproportionately increases as immigrants see more same-ethnic peers, and friendship density among natives has no effect on this. By contrast, native homophily remains relatively low until natives see dense groups of immigrants. The authors' results suggest that theories of interethnic competition and contact opportunities apply differently to ethnic majority and minority groups.",
Exploring the Combination of Dempster-Shafer Theory and Neural Network for Predicting Trust and Distrust,COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,2016,2016,"In social media, trust and distrust among users are important factors in helping users make decisions, dissect information, and receive recommendations. However, the sparsity and imbalance of social relations bring great difficulties and challenges in predicting trust and distrust. Meanwhile, there are numerous inducing factors to determine trust and distrust relations. The relationship among inducing factors may be dependency, independence, and conflicting. Dempster-Shafer theory and neural network are effective and efficient strategies to deal with these difficulties and challenges. In this paper, we study trust and distrust prediction based on the combination of Dempster-Shafer theory and neural network. We firstly analyze the inducing factors about trust and distrust, namely, homophily, status theory, and emotion tendency. Then, we quantify inducing factors of trust and distrust, take these features as evidences, and construct evidence prototype as input nodes of multilayer neural network. Finally, we propose a framework of predicting trust and distrust which uses multilayer neural network to model the implementing process of Dempster-Shafer theory in different hidden layers, aiming to overcome the disadvantage of Dempster-Shafer theory without optimization method. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
The Contingent Effects of Social Networks on Social Learning in ERP Assimilation,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 49TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES (HICSS 2016),2016,2016,"In the assimilation stage of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, a major challenge for employees and managers is to overcome knowledge barriers and learn ERP knowledge efficiently. Social learning refers to informal learning-from-others in daily works. Prior literature has shown benefits of social networks on individual learning. However, several studies suggested that the value of social networks doesn't generalize to all conditions. We employed a comparative case study to identify key components of social learning and investigate the contingent effects of social networks on social learning in different organizational settings. Data obtained by interviewing 23 ERP users in two firms in China indicate that 1) social learning is a bidirectional process with two essential stages, 2) instrumental ties, position homophily, external ties, and centrality of ERP learning network are positively associated with social learning, and 3) expressive ties and rank homophily affect social learning contingently.",
Strategic Network Formation in a Location-Based Social Network: A Topic Modeling Approach,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 49TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES (HICSS 2016),2016,2016,"This paper studies strategic network formation in a location-based social network. We build a structural model of social link creation that incorporates individual characteristics and pairwise user similarities. Specifically, we define four user proximity measures from biography, geography, mobility, and short messages. To construct proximity from unstructured text information, we build topic models using latent Dirichlet allocation. Using Gowalla data with 385,306 users, three million locations, and 35 million check-in records, we empirically estimate the structural model to find evidence on the homophily effect in network formation.",
"From social anxiety to interpersonal connectedness: Relationship building within face-to-face, phone and instant messaging mediums",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jan 2016,2016,"The present research examined whether social anxiety moderates the potential relationship between conversation medium and interpersonal connectedness. Hypotheses predicted that individuals with high social anxiety would demonstrate greater interpersonal connectedness following instant messaging conversations; whereas, individuals with low social anxiety would report greater interpersonal connectedness following face-to-face and phone conversations. Undergraduate participants (N = 165) were randomly assigned to one of three conversation mediums (face-to-face, phone or instant messaging) during which they engaged in an interaction with an unfamiliar partner. Participants completed a measure of social anxiety before the interaction and measures of interpersonal connectedness prior to and following the interaction. Results revealed that level of social anxiety is a significant contingent condition for the association between type of conversation medium and attitude homophily (i.e., a measure of interpersonal connectedness). For individuals with low social anxiety, scores on the attitude homophily measure were significantly lower in the instant messaging condition, compared to the face-to-face and phone conditions.

Adolescent Friend Similarity on Alcohol Abuse as a Function of Participation in Romantic Relationships: Sometimes a New Love Comes Between Old Friends,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Jan 2016,2016,"This study tests the hypothesis that adolescents with romantic partners are less similar to their friends on rates of alcohol abuse than adolescents without romantic partners. Participants ( 662 girls, 574 boys) ranging in age from 12 to 19 years nominated friends and romantic partners, and completed a measure of alcohol abuse. In hierarchical linear models, friends with romantic partners were less similar on rates of alcohol abuse than friends without romantic partners, especially if they were older and less accepted. Follow-up longitudinal analyses were conducted on a subsample (266 boys, 374 girls) of adolescents who reported friendships that were stable across 2 consecutive years. Associations between friend reports of alcohol abuse declined after adolescents became involved in a romantic relationship, to the point at which they became more similar to their romantic partners than to their friends.",
Rumors and factitious informational blends: The role of the web in speculative politics,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Jan 2016,2016,"The World Wide Web has changed the dynamics of information transmission and agenda-setting. Facts mingle with half-truths and untruths to create factitious informational blends (FIBs) that drive speculative politics. We specify an information environment that mirrors and contributes to a polarized political system and develop a methodology that measures the interaction of the two. We do so by examining the evolution of two comparable claims during the 2004 presidential campaign in three streams of data: (1) web pages, (2) Google searches, and (3) media coverage. We find that the web is not sufficient alone for spreading misinformation, but it leads the agenda for traditional media. We find no evidence for equality of influence in network actors.",
From neighbors to school friends? How adolescents' place of residence relates to same-ethnic school friendships,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2016,2016,"This study examines to what extent adolescents' place of residence is related to the opportunities and the preferences to befriend same-ethnic classmates. Analyzing 3345 students within 158 German and Dutch school classes, we find that sharing a neighborhood provides additional meeting opportunities to become friends in class as adolescents are likely to befriend classmates who live nearby them or who live nearby a friend of them (propinquity mechanism). However, this hardly explains why adolescent friendship networks in school classes tend to be ethnically homogeneous. Also, we find no convincing evidence that an adolescent's preference for same-ethnic friends in class varies with the share of outgroup members in his/her neighborhood (exposure mechanism).

The influence of structural balance and homophily/heterophobia on the adjustment of random complete signed networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2016,2016,"Inconsistencies in the empirical support for balance theory are often explained by recourse to competing mechanisms that reduce the total degree of balance in the network. These mechanisms (such as differential popularity and subgroup hostility) may depend on exogenous properties of the nodes. This paper offers an alternative explanation for the departure of networks from global balance, according to which the myopic nature of sign adjustment in accordance with a pressure for local balance may reduce the global degree of balance and impede the formation of groups, whereas competing mechanisms that rely on exogenous node properties (e.g., homophily) facilitate these processes. The paper describes a set of simulations designed to study the evolution of complete signed networks under a local sign-change regime, induced by structural balance, homophily and heterophobia. Tolerance for local violation of balance and homophily is allowed to vary with a consequent impact upon the global degree of balance and group formation processes. We find the conditions under which the pressure towards local homophily and balance operate against each other culminating in a (locally) dynamic yet (globally) stationary state in which homophily adjusts towards group formation and balance undermines this process.

Partner selection in international environmental networks: The effect of skills and money on cooperation in the Global South,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY,Jan 2016,2016,"What explains cooperation in international environmental networks? What are the effects of skills and money on the decision by state agencies to collaborate across borders on environmental problems? This article answers these questions, showing that international cooperation provides environmental bureaucrats and their agencies with the opportunity to pool scarce resources, update critical skills, and attract funds from international donors. Theory and results offer novel findings on network homophily (the tendency of similar actors to work together), as international cooperation increases between environmental state agencies at similar levels of program development. Hypotheses are tested using social network analysis to measure cooperation on a dataset that includes all regional and global grants awarded over the past two decades by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

The Network of International Student Mobility (Working Title),21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INDICATORS (STI 2016),2016,2016,"In a previous paper (see Vogtle and Windzio 2016) we investigated the impact of membership in the Bologna Process on patterns and driving forces of cross-national student mobility. Student exchange flows were analysed for almost all Bologna Process member states and nonBologna OECD members over a ten-year period (from 2000 to 2009). We applied a Social Network Approach focusing on outbound diploma-mobility to identify positions of countries in the network of cross-national student exchange. Based on social network analyses, we first visualized the exchange patterns between sampled countries. In doing so, we analysed the student exchange linkages to gain descriptive insights into the development of the network (see Figure 1). Second, we used Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) to test which factors determine patterns of transnational student mobility. The results of this network analyses reveal that cross-national student exchange networks are stable over time. At the core of these networks are the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany; they attract the highest shares of students from the remaining countries in our sample. Moreover, the results of the ERGM demonstrate that homophily between countries determines student exchange patterns. The most relevant ties exist between bordering countries. Moreover, membership in the Bologna Process impacts on mobility patterns, and the effect size increases over the periods investigated.",
The Echo Chamber: Strategic Voting and Homophily in Social Networks,AAMAS'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTONOMOUS AGENTS & MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS,2016,2016,"We propose a model where voters are embedded in a social network. Each voter observes the ballots of her neighbors in the network, from which she infers the likely outcome of the election. Each voter may then revise her vote strategically, to maximize her expected utility. Our work focuses on plurality voting, where strategic voting is a major concern. We show that in practice, strategization increases with voter knowledge, yet can improve the social welfare for the population. Real world social networks exhibit a property called homophily; sometimes called ""The Echo Chamber Effect"", which is the tendency for friends to have similar ideologies. We find that homophily dampens the benefits of strategization, and correspondingly, lowers the frequency of its occurrence. This effect may contribute to the low number of strategic voters observed in real world elections. Additionally, strategization may lead to the elimination of less popular candidates, as voters revise their votes to less preferred but more hopeful candidates. This phenomenon is known as Duverger's Law in political science, and we show that it does not hold in certain network structures.",
Influences of SNS Brand Community Experience on Brand Loyalty,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ANNUAL CONFERENCE (2016), BKS ONE AND TWO",2016,2016,"Recently, SNS brand community experience research is an important issue for social media marketing. Current research analyzed the relationships of SNS brand community experiences, community commitment and brand loyalty through South Korea consumer. Research results showed that the information experience, entertainment experience, homophily experience and relationship base experience had positive influences on community commitment. Which authors designed in the study of ""relationship base experience"" had the largest impact on community commitments. SNS brand community commitment had a positive influence on brand attitude (attitudinal loyalty). However, SNS brand community commitment did not have a significant impact on the purchase intention (behavioral loyalty). Brand attitude directly influence on the purchase intention. Lastly, the research had discussed the theoretical and practical implications.",
HeteroSales: Utilizing Heterogeneous Social Networks to Identify the Next Enterprise Customer,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW'16),2016,2016,"Nowadays, a modern e-commerce company may have both online sales and offline sales departments. Normally, online sales attempt to sell in small quantities to individual customers through broadcasting a large amount of emails or promotion codes, which heavily rely on the designed backend algorithms. Offline sales, on the other hand, try to sell in much larger quantities to enterprise customers through contacts initiated by sales representatives, which are more costly compared to online sales. Unlike many previous research works focusing on machine learning algorithms to support online sales, this paper introduces an approach that utilizes heterogenous social networks to improve the effectiveness of offline sales. More specifically, we propose a two-phase framework, HeteroSales, which first constructs a company-to-company graph, a.k.a. Company Homophily Graph (CHG), from semantics based meta-path learning, and then adopts label propagation on the graph to predict promising companies that we may successfully close an offline deal with. Based on the statistical analysis on the world's largest professional social network, LinkedIn, we demonstrate interesting discoveries showing that not all the social connections in a heterogeneous social network are useful in this task. In other words, some proper data preprocessing is essential to ensure the effectiveness of offline sales. Finally, through the experiments on LinkedIn social network data and third-party offline sales records, we demonstrate the power of HereroSales to identify potential enterprise customers in offline sales.",
Learning to Rank Personalized Search Results in Professional Networks,SIGIR'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 39TH INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL,2016,2016,"LinkedIn search is deeply personalized - for the same queries, different searchers expect completely different results. This paper presents our approach to achieving this by mining various data sources available in LinkedIn to infer searchers' intents (such as hiring, job seeking, etc.), as well as extending the concept of homophily to capture the searcher-result similarities on many aspects. Then, learning-to-rank is applied to combine these signals with standard search features.",
Controversy Detection in Wikipedia Using Collective Classification,SIGIR'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 39TH INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL,2016,2016,"Concerns over personalization in IR have sparked an interest in detection and analysis of controversial topics. Accurate detection would enable many beneficial applications, such as alerting search users to controversy. Wikipedia's broad coverage and rich metadata offer a valuable resource for this problem. We hypothesize that intensities of controversy among related pages are not independent. Thus, we propose a stacked model which exploits the dependencies among related pages. Our approach improves classification of controversial web pages when compared to a model that examines each page in isolation, demonstrating that controversial topics exhibit homophily. Using notions of similarity to construct a subnetwork for collective classification, rather than using the default network present in the relational data, leads to improved classification with wider applications for semi-structured datasets, with the effects most pronounced when a small set of neighbors is used.",
Conversations and Campaign Dynamics in a Hybrid Media Environment: Use of Twitter by Members of the German Bundestag,SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY,JAN-MAR 2016,2016,"This article examines how Members of the German Bundestag (MdBs) used Twitter in the context of the country's 2013 federal elections. In particular, we explore the dynamics in the MdBs' use of Twitter during different periods of the electoral term: How do the tweeting habits of MdBs differ by party before and during the election campaign in (a) public versus personal communication and (b) campaign versus policy messages? How are the selection of interaction partners, centralization on leading actors, and reciprocity of the MdBs' Twitter networks affected by election campaigning? We address these questions by conducting a content analysis combined with a network analysis of interaction patterns. The comparative application of both methods explains the differences of MdBs' networks. The comparison clearly exhibits election campaign-driven changes related to the amount of activity and the character of tweeted messages. During the campaign period, MdBs' tweets clearly discussed specific policies less than before. Tweeting about one's personal life occurred also less frequently in the final campaign stage. Instead, the MdBs mainly complement other forms of election campaigning through a vivid metacommunication on campaign developments. Network relations reflect these variations and were less often reciprocated in proximity to the election and showed a higher degree of group homophily. We also found a substantial representation of print and broadcast media actors in the examined @ reply networks. It is likely that these interactions and conversations with journalists are part of an MdB's individual performance of ""news management.""",
Health as status? Network relations and social structure in an American retirement community,AGEING & SOCIETY,Jan 2016,2016,"This study examines social ties within a community of retirement residents to examine how health influences patterns of social interaction. Drawing from a social fields perspective, I anticipated that health would emerge as a key form of status. I hypothesised that this would manifest in the healthiest residents receiving a disproportionate share of social tie nominations, and that the network would be characterised by distinct patterns of health-based sorting. Exponential random graph models were used to disentangle individual, dyadic and higher-order influences on reports of interaction. Findings support the main hypotheses, pointing to the importance of health as a basis of micro-level social structure in contexts where it is a scarce and valued resource. I urge further research to trace out these implications in other unique settings.",

An observational study identifying obese subgroups among older adults at increased risk of mobility disability: do perceptions of the neighborhood environment matter?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,Dec 18 2015,2015,"Background: Obesity is an increasingly prevalent condition among older adults, yet relatively little is known about how built environment variables may be associated with obesity in older age groups. This is particularly the case for more vulnerable older adults already showing functional limitations associated with subsequent disability.Methods: The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) trial dataset (n = 1600) was used to explore the associations between perceived built environment variables and baseline obesity levels. Age-stratified recursive partitioning methods were applied to identify distinct subgroups with varying obesity prevalence.Results: Among participants aged 70-78 years, four distinct subgroups, defined by combinations of perceived environment and race-ethnicity variables, were identified. The subgroups with the lowest obesity prevalence (45.5-59.4 %) consisted of participants who reported living in neighborhoods with higher residential density. Among participants aged 79-89 years, the subgroup (of three distinct subgroups identified) with the lowest obesity prevalence (19.4 %) consisted of non-African American/Black participants who reported living in neighborhoods with friends or acquaintances similar in demographic characteristics to themselves. Overall support for the partitioned subgroupings was obtained using mixed model regression analysis.Conclusions: The results suggest that, in combination with race/ethnicity, features of the perceived neighborhood built and social environments differentiated distinct groups of vulnerable older adults from different age strata that differed in obesity prevalence. Pending further verification, the results may help to inform subsequent targeting of such subgroups for further investigation.",
Cooperation dynamics of polycentric climate governance,MATHEMATICAL MODELS & METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES,Dec 15 2015,2015,"Global coordination for the preservation of a common good, such as climate, is one of the most prominent challenges of modern societies. In this manuscript, we use the framework of evolutionary game theory to investigate whether a polycentric structure of multiple small-scale agreements provides a viable solution to solve global dilemmas as climate change governance. We review a stochastic model which incorporates a threshold game of collective action and the idea of risky goods, capturing essential features unveiled in recent experiments. We show how reducing uncertainty both in terms of the perception of disaster and in terms of goals induce a transition to cooperation. Taking into account wealth inequality, we explore the impact of the homophily, potentially present in the network of influence of the rich and the poor, in the different contributions of the players. Finally, we discuss the impact of polycentric sanctioning institutions, showing how such a scenario also proves to be more efficient than a single global institution.",
Social Affiliation from Religious Disaffiliation: Evidence of Selective Mixing Among Youth with No Religious Preference During the Transition to College,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,Dec 2015,2015,"The number of individuals claiming a nonreligious identity in the United States is on the rise, with one-fourth of the overall U.S. public failing to identify with any of the major religious traditions. In this article, we examine whether religious disaffiliation structures social network formation in a social context in which religious identification (and religiosity) is a salient cultural marker. We take advantage of unique data on the personal networks of youth transitioning into a college where religion is a culturally salient facet of everyday life. We hypothesize that, if there is nonreligious homophily, it may result from an attraction of the disaffiliated to each other or from a repulsion away from the religiously affiliated. Results of exponential random graph models suggest that both mechanisms may be at play. We find that religious Nones and affiliated non-Catholics are disproportionately more likely to form and maintain relationships with one another and are relatively less likely to form and maintain relationships with members of their respective religious out-groups. We close by outlining the implications of our findings and delineating promising avenues for future research.",
Identifying the topology of the K-pop video community on YouTube: A combined Co-comment analysis approach,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Dec 2015,2015,"YouTube is a successful social network that people use to upload, watch, and comment on videos. We believe comments left on these videos can provide insight into user interests, but to this point have not been used to map out a specific video community. Our study investigates whether and how user commenting behavior impacts the topology of the K-pop video community through analysis of co-commenting behavior on these videos. We apply a traditional author cocitation analysis to this behavior, in a process we refer to as co-comment analysis, to detect the topology of this community. This involves: a) an analysis of user co-comments to elicit the inclination of user homophily within the community; b) an analysis of user co-comments, weighted frequency of co-comments, to detect user interests in the community; and c) an analysis of user co-comments, weighted sentiment scores, to capture user opinions by polarity. The results indicate that users who comment on specific K-pop videos also tend to comment on topically similar YouTube videos. We also find that the number of comments made by users correlates with the degree of positivity of their comments. Conversely, users who comment negatively on K-pop videos are not inclined to form specific user groups, but rather present only their opinions individually.",
Temporal influence over the Last.fm social network,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,Dec 2015,2015,"In a previous result, we showed that the influence of social contacts spreads information about new artists through the Last.fm social network. We successfully decomposed influence from effects of trends, global popularity, and homophily or shared environment of friends. In this paper, we present our new experiments that use a mathematically sound formula for defining and measuring the influence in the network. We provide new baseline and influence models and evaluation measures, both batch and online, for real-time recommendations with very strong temporal aspects. Our experiments are carried over the 2-year ""scrobble"" history of 70,000 Last.fm users. In our results, we formally define and distil the effect of social influence. In addition, we provide new models and evaluation measures for real-time recommendations with very strong temporal aspects.",
Inference of demographic attributes based on mobile phone usage patterns and social network topology,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,Dec 2015,2015,"Mobile phone usage provides a wealth of information, which can be used to better understand the demographic structure of a population. In this paper, we focus on the population of Mexican mobile phone users. We first present an observational study of mobile phone usage according to gender and age groups. We are able to detect significant differences in phone usage among different subgroups of the population. We then study the performance of different machine learning (ML) methods to predict demographic features (namely, age and gender) of unlabeled users by leveraging individual calling patterns, as well as the structure of the communication graph. We show how a specific implementation of a diffusion model, harnessing the graph structure, has significantly better performance over other node-based standard ML methods. We provide details of the methodology together with an analysis of the robustness of our results to changes in the model parameters. Furthermore, by carefully examining the topological relations of the training nodes (seed nodes) to the rest of the nodes in the network, we find topological metrics which have a direct influence on the performance of the algorithm.",
"Social ties, homophily and extraversion-introversion to generate complex networks",SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,Dec 2015,2015,"Many interconnected systems and particularly social interactions can be modeled as networks. These networks often exhibit common properties such as high clustering coefficient, low average path lengths and degree distributions following power-law. Networks having these properties are called small world-scale free networks or simply complex networks. Recent interest in complex networks has catalysed the development of algorithmic models to artificially generate these networks. Often these algorithms introduce network properties in the model regardless of their social interpretation resulting in networks which are statistically similar but structurally different from real world networks. In this paper, we focus on social networks and apply concepts of social ties, homophily and extraversion-introversion to develop a model for social networks with small world and scale free properties. We claim that the proposed model produces networks which are structurally similar to real world social networks.",
Misery loves company: happiness and communication in the city,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,Dec 2015,2015,"The high population density in cities confers many advantages, including improved social interaction and information exchange. However, it is often argued that urban living comes at the expense of reducing happiness. The goal of this research is to shed light on the relationship between urban communication and urban happiness. We analyze geo-located social media posts (tweets) within a major urban center (Milan) to produce a detailed spatial map of urban sentiments. We combine this data with high-resolution mobile communication intensity data among different urban areas. Our results reveal that happy (respectively unhappy) areas preferentially communicate with other areas of their type. This observation constitutes evidence of homophilous communities at the scale of an entire city (Milan), and has implications on interventions that aim to improve urban well-being.",
I Don't Like You Any More: Facebook Unfriending by Israelis During the Israel-Gaza Conflict of 2014,JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,Dec 2015,2015,"This article explores Facebook unfriending during the Israel-Gaza conflict of 2014. We suggest that politically motivated unfriending is a new kind of political gesture. We present an analysis of a survey of 1,013 Jewish Israeli Facebook users. A total of 16% of users unfriended or unfollowed a Facebook friend during the fighting. Unfriending was more prevalent among more ideologically extreme and more politically active Facebook users. Weak ties were most likely to be broken, and respondents mostly unfriended people because they took offense at what they had posted or disagreed with it. Although social network sites may expose people to diverse opinions, precisely by virtue of the many weak ties users have on them, our findings show these ties to be susceptible to dissolution.",
The coevolution of beliefs and networks,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,Dec 2015,2015,"Social psychologists have shown that people experience cognitive dissonance when two or more of their cognitions diverge, and that they actively manage the dissonance. With this in mind, we develop a model of social learning in networks to understand the coevolution of beliefs and networks. We focus on beliefs concerning an objective phenomenon. Initial beliefs are based on noisy, private and unbiased information. Because the information is noisy, initial beliefs differ, creating dissonance. In our model, behavior is motivated by a desire to minimize this dissonance. In many circumstances this behavior adversely affects the efficiency of social learning, such that in equilibrium the mean aggregate belief is biased and there is significant variation of beliefs across the population. The parameterizations of our model that result in the most inefficient learning produce a fractionalized network structure in which there are a number of distinct groups: within any group all beliefs are identical; beliefs differ from group to group, sometimes greatly; there is no intergroup interaction. Since dissonance minimizing behavior is apparently a deeply rooted feature of humans, we are led to ask: What policies could improve the situation? Our results suggest that policies that improve the availability of objective information and/or increase the size of networks enhance efficiency of social learning. On the other hand, anything that makes changing networks more attractive as a dissonance minimizing strategy has the opposite effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
"Co-authorship, Homophily, and Scholarly Influence in Information Systems Research",JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Dec 2015,2015,"Information Systems (IS) researchers have increasingly focused attention on understanding the identity of our field (Hirschheim & Klein 2003; Lyytinen & King 2004). One facet of any discipline's identity is the social aspect of how its scholars actually conduct their work (DeSanctis 2003), which is formally labeled as the study of sociology of science. Contributing to this tradition of work, we empirically examine scholarly influence (Acedo et al., 2006); scientific collaboration, including metrics that capture the prevalence of c-oauthored work; antecedents to co-authorship; and the effect of co-authorship on subsequent citations. Based on analyzing five leading IS journals for a period of seven years, we found that co-authored papers have become increasingly common in leading IS journals and that coauthoring continues to be more prevalent in journals published in North America compared to European journals. Moreover, we found significant effects of homophily related to gender, homophily/proximity, and geography. IS scholars worldwide exhibit a stronger preference for collaborating with co-authors of the same sex and those who attended the same PhD program than one would expect by chance. We also examined differences among journals and found some intriguing results for the effect of co-authorship on citations. Overall, we found evidence that the number of co-authors was positively related to citations although there was some variance across journals. These findings point to a need for more research to better understand both the processes of collaboration and the drivers and downstream benefits associated with it.",
Bridging the online/offline divide: The example of digital gaming,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Dec 2015,2015,"Studies of virtual worlds are often based on the dichotomous 'real world'/'virtual world', yet research has indicated that this division is far from unproblematic. The aim of this study is to examine empirically the link between online/offline using the example of social online gaming. The data consist of individual and group interviews with 33 adult garners. The results explore three themes sociability and design; group membership; norms and rules and show how on-and offline are inexorably linked through the social organizational demands of Internet gaming. Individuals ground online group membership in offline relations and shared characteristics, aiming to maximize game-play gains and support sociability. Gaming with 'people like us' facilitates creation of norms and expectations, which aids in producing stable social groups. Thus the boundary between online and offline becomes contingent on links between people. The study shows how important offline connections are for online interaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

F-Commerce platform for apparel online social shopping: Testing a Mowen's 3M model,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,Dec 2015,2015,"Applying the Meta-Theoretic Model of Motivation and Personality (3M Model), this research examined (1) whether online social shopping intention in Facebook commerce was affected by users' personality traits, psychographic characteristics, and gratifications and (2) whether tie strength and homophily moderated the links between gratifications and intention. U.S. Facebook users who had online social shopping experience (n=601) were drawn from a consumer panel. Users who were market mavens and social browsers were likely to use online social shopping for the purpose of socializing and intended to engage in online social shopping.

Choice of comparator in restorative trials: A network analysis,DENTAL MATERIALS,Dec 2015,2015,"Objectives. The choice of trial comparators might impact on the validity of the available evidence. We aimed at evaluating dental restorative trial networks and the underlying comparisons made, hypothesizing that certain comparators are disproportionally preferred or avoided.Methods. A systematic review was performed via Medline, CENTRAL and EMBASE. Randomized controlled trials on dental restoration or adhesive materials published 2005-2015 were included. Social network analysis techniques were used to assess trial networks.Results. 114 studies on 15 321 restorations placed in 5232 patients were included. 57 and 53 trials investigated restoration of cervical and load-bearing cavities, respectively. Four trials on non-cervical, non-load-bearing cavities did not form a network and were not evaluated. The most frequently assessed material combination was hybrid composites placed using 2-step etch-and-rinse adhesives. In cervical cavities, the majority of trials compared adhesives, not restorative materials. In load-bearing cavities, testing other restorative materials (ormocers, compomers) was common, too. In both networks, comparisons within material classes were frequent. There was significant homophily (p <0.001), i.e. certain material classes were preferred as comparators, while this preference seemed to change with time. Only very few comparisons yielded significant differences between materials.Significance. The disproportional use of certain material classes as comparator might be due to their perceived role as gold standard. Compared with other scientific disciplines, dental restorative trial networks seem less prone for bias by comparator choice. Factors underlying the network geometry should be assessed to understand drivers of the research agenda. (C) 2015 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Effects of Heterogeneity and Homophily on Cooperation,SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY,Dec 2015,2015,"The article provides a micro-behavioral model and an experimental design to understand the effect of heterogeneity in social identities on cooperation while accounting for endogenous sorting. Social identity is induced exogenously using the minimal group paradigm. The experiment manipulates sorting with three treatments: having subjects interact with both in- and outgroup members, giving them the choice to interact either with ingroup or outgroup members, and isolating the groups from the outset. Cooperation is measured by the Prisoner's Dilemma Games at the dyadic level and by Public Goods Games at the tetradic level. The results show that heterogeneity hampers between-group cooperation at the dyadic level. In addition, endogenous sorting mitigates this negative effect of heterogeneity on cooperation. Heterogeneity hampers cooperation at the tetradic level most substantially if there is a commonly known negative history between groups.",
Homophily-Based Link Prediction in The Facebook Online Social Network: A Rough Sets Approach,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,Dec 2015,2015,"Online social networks are highly dynamic and sparse. One of the main problems in analyzing these networks is the problem of predicting the existence of links between users on these networks: the link prediction problem. Many studies have been conducted to predict links using a variety of techniques like the decision tree and the logistic regression approaches. In this work, we will illustrate the use of the rough set theory in predicting links over the Facebook social network based on homophilic features. Other supervised learning algorithms are also employed in our experiments and compared with the rough set classifier, such as naive Bayes, J48 decision tree, support vector machine, logistic regression, and multilayer perceptron neural network. Moreover, we studied the influence of the ""common groups"" and ""common page likes"" homophilic features on predicting friendship between users of Facebook, and also studied the effect of using the Jaccard coefficient in measuring the similarity between users' homophilic attributes compared with using the overlap coefficient. We conducted our experiments on two different datasets obtained from the Facebook online social network, where users in each dataset live within the same geographical region. The results showed that the rough set classifier significantly outperformed the other classifiers in all experiments. The results also demonstrated that the common groups and the common page likes features have a significant influence on predicting the friendship between users of Facebook. Finally, the results revealed that using the overlap coefficient homophilic features provided better results than that of the Jaccard coefficient features.",
Skill heterogeneity in startups and its development over time,SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS,Dec 2015,2015,"We study how startup teams are assembled in terms of team member human capital characteristics. To this end, we derive a statistically motivated benchmark for new venture team heterogeneity in terms of observed team member characteristics to generate stylized facts about team member diversity at startup and how it evolves as the new venture matures. We use the population of Danish startups that were established in 1998 and track them until 2001. Main findings are that teams are relatively more homogeneous at startup compared to our benchmark, indicating that difficulties associated with workforce heterogeneity (like affective conflict or coordination cost) as well as ""homophily"" (people's inclination to bound with others with similar characteristics) may overweigh the benefits of heterogeneity. While workforce heterogeneity does increase over time, the increase is smaller compared to our benchmark but substantially larger than if team additions and replacements had the same characteristics as the initial team members.",
The Emergence of Relationship-based Cooperation,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Nov 16 2015,2015,"This paper investigates the emergence of relationship-based cooperation by coupling two simple mechanisms into the model: tie strength based investment preference and homophily assumption. We construct the model by categorizing game participants into four types: prosocialists (players who prefers to invest in their intimate friends), antisocialists (players who prefer to invest in strangers), egoists (players who never cooperate) and altruists (players who cooperate indifferently with anyone). We show that the relationship-based cooperation (prosocialists) is favored throughout the evolution if we assume players of the same type have stronger ties than different ones. Moreover, we discover that strengthening the internal bonds within the strategic clusters further promotes the competitiveness of prosocialists and therefore facilitates the emergence of relationship-based cooperation in our proposed scenarios. The robustness of the model is also tested under different strategy updating rules and network structures. The results show that this argument is robust against the variations of initial conditions and therefore can be considered as a fundamental theoretical framework to study relationship-based cooperation in reality.",
Mapping online political talks through network analysis: a case study of the website of Italy's Five Star Movement,POLICY STUDIES,Nov 2 2015,2015,"Understanding relations among online users involved in political discussions can help us understand similarities and differences with corresponding offline interactions. Online communities generally demonstrate too high a level of homophily among users to be illustrative. But online political discussions do not necessarily prevent diversity of opinions. The discussion Forum of Italy's Five Star Movement provides an interesting case study because of the diverse political orientations of participants and the wide range of discussion topics. I apply network analysis to map in detail the relations among the Forum's users to unravel network characteristics and actor behaviours. After harvesting 86,943 discussions and 461,297 comments published by 84,203 unique users, I capture features of the network topology to understand: whether users participate in various discussions; if discussions fragment in multiple threads showing assortative mixing tendencies; and if comments concentrate around few discussions approaching a power-law like distribution. This paper aims to improve understanding of the argumentative political discourse, but has also applications for political institutions interested in enhancing computer-mediated public reasoning.",
JOURNALIST-SOURCE RELATIONS The case of Taiwan correspondents in China,JOURNALISM STUDIES,Nov 2 2015,2015,"This article examines the news work of Taiwan correspondents in mainland China, focusing particularly on the issue of journalist-source relations. Drawing upon the concepts of tie strength and homophily from social network analysis, this article argues that strong and heterophilous ties play a crucial role for foreign correspondents working within a context where news information does not always flow freely. Data from in-depth interviews and a supplementary survey show that different types of source ties offer different types of information to the Taiwan correspondents. The analysis illustrates how strong ties with Chinese officials and correspondents from other countries allow Taiwan journalists to obtain the news information and clues that are of the highest value, i.e., information and clues about exclusive and/or sensitive stories. The Taiwan correspondents established such strong ties through long-term interactions and instrumental exchange. Implications of the findings for understanding the work of foreign correspondents are discussed.",
Similar Others in Same-Sex Couples' Social Networks,JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY,Nov 2 2015,2015,"Same-sex couples experience unique minority stressors. It is known that strong social networks facilitate access to psychosocial resources that help people reduce and manage stress. However, little is known about the social networks of same-sex couples, in particular their connections to other same-sex couples, which is important to understand given that the presence of similar others in social networks can ameliorate social stress for stigmatized populations. In this brief report, we present data from a diverse sample of 120 same-sex couples in Atlanta and San Francisco. The median number of other same-sex couples known was 12; couples where one partner was non-Hispanic White and the other a person of color knew relatively few other same-sex couples; and there was a high degree of homophily within the social networks of same-sex couples. These data establish a useful starting point for future investigations of couples' social networks, especially couples whose relationships are stigmatized or marginalized in some way. Better understandings of the size, composition, and functions of same-sex couples' social networks are critically needed.",
A triadic closure and homophily-based recommendation system for online social networks,WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Nov 2015,2015,"Recommendation systems are popular both commercially and in the research community. For example, Online in Social Networks (OSNs) like Twitter, they are gaining an increasing attention since a lot of connection are established between users without any previous knowledge. This highlights one of the key features of a lot of OSNs: the creation of relationships between users. Therefore, it is important to find new ways to provide interesting friendships suggestions. However, mining and analyzing data from large scale Social Networks can become critical in terms of computational resources. This is particularly true in the context of ubiquitous access, where resource-constrained mobile devices are used to access the social network services. To this end, designing architectures/solutions offering the possibility of operating in a Mobile Cloud scenario is of key importance. Accordingly, we present a new recommendation system scheme that tries to find the right trade-offs between the exploitation of the already existing links/relationships and the interest affinities between users. In particular, such scheme is based on an inherently parallel Hubs And Authorities algorithm together with similarity measures that, for scalability purposes, can be easily transposed in a cloud scenario. The first one let us leverage triadic closures while the second one takes into account homophily. The proposal is supported by an extensive performance analysis on publicly available Twitter data. In particular, we proved the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation system by using several performance metrics available in the literature which include precision, recall, F-measure and G-measure. The results show encouraging perspectives in terms of both effectiveness and scalability, that are driving our future research efforts.",
"Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms and Newlyweds' Observed Communication, Partner Characteristics, and Longitudinal Marital Outcomes",JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2015,2015,"Given borderline personality disorder's (BPD) relation with interpersonal dysfunction, there is substantial interest in understanding BPD's effect on marriage. The current study used data from a community sample of 172 newlywed couples to examine spouses' BPD symptoms in relation to their observed communication, partner BPD symptoms, 4-year marital quality trajectories, and 10-year divorce rates. BPD symptoms were correlated cross-sectionally with more negative skills during observational problem-solving and social support tasks, and spouses reporting more BPD symptoms were married to partners reporting more BPD symptoms. Longitudinally, hierarchical linear modeling of newlyweds' 4-year marital trajectories indicated that BPD symptoms predicted the intercept of marital quality for spouses and their partners, reflecting lower levels of marital satisfaction and higher levels of marital problems. BPD symptoms did not predict 10-year divorce rates. These findings highlight the chronic relationship impairment associated with BPD symptoms, indicate that distress begins early in marriage, and suggest that partners with higher levels of BPD symptoms remain in more troubled marriages.",
How you talk about climate change matters: A communication network perspective on epistemic skepticism and belief strength,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,Nov 2015,2015,"A population's attitudes toward climate change can strongly influence governmental policies as well as community and individual climate-related behaviors. These attitudes have been explained with a variety of factors, including cultural worldviews, environmental attitudes, political ideology, knowledge of climate change, severe weather exposure, and sociodemographic characteristics. These studies typically assume an individual forms attitudes on the basis of preexisting values or beliefs and do not account for dynamic social interaction as a source of influence. This study introduces a network perspective that accounts for the social embeddedness of individuals, using network variables to predict climate attitudes, including homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, centrality, network size, and network valence. An exploratory factor analysis identified two distinct attitudinal dimensions: climate change epistemic skepticism and belief strength. Using egocentric data from a nationally representative survey collected in 2011, this study found that network variables were significant in predicting both climate attitude dimensions; hierarchical regression analyses accounting for other known predictors found two different predictive models for epistemic skepticism and belief strength. Homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, and network valence predicted epistemic skepticism (R-change(2) = 4.8%), while centrality and network strength predicted belief strength (R-change(2)=8.9%). The analyses also found support for cultural factors as significant predictors of climate attitudes, particularly Christianity and cultural worldviews. The results of this study suggest that interpersonal influence through communication networks is a promising avenue for continued research, and should be included in studies of climate attitude formation and change.

Do birds singing the same song flock together? A mixed-method study on language as a tool for changing social homophily in primary schools in Flanders (Belgium),INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS,Nov 2015,2015,"The characteristics of a school's pupil population determine the boundaries within which friendships can grow at school, as pupils tend to develop friendships with others that are similar to them. This is an example of social homophily. Since language is an indicator of social status and identity, we aim at finding out whether it is a basis for social homophily. This study investigates what the effects of linguistic diversity on same-language friendships are for both multilingual pupils and pupils from Dutch-only homes and whether tolerant practices towards multilingualism impact friendship patterns. To get a deeper understanding of the context in which friendships develop, we examine pupils' perception of the language hierarchies in their school as well. We use a mixed-method design. The quantitative data analyzed in this article originate from a teacher and pupil survey in 67 primary schools in three highly diverse regions in Flanders during the 2012-2013 school year. The qualitative data have been gathered in two focus groups in which 24 pupils of the same school participated. Stepwise multilevel modeling showed that for multilingual pupils, a negative effect of tolerant practices towards multilingualism on same-language friendships existed, while linguistic diversity was of lesser importance. For pupils from Dutch-only homes, linguistic diversity had a negative effect on the number of same-language friendships and tolerance did not matter for friendship patterns. The insignificant effect of tolerance in pupils from Dutch-only homes can be explained by the strong dominance of Dutch, which the qualitative analysis also revealed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Diffusion of innovations in Axelrod's model,JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT,Nov 2015,2015,"Axelrod's model for the dissemination of culture contains two key factors required to model the process of diffusion of innovations, namely, social influence (i.e. individuals become more similar when they interact) and homophily (i.e. individuals interact preferentially with similar others). The strength of these factors is controlled by two parameters: F, the number of features that characterize the cultures, and q, the common number of states each feature can assume. For fixed F, a large value of q reduces the frequency of interactions between individuals because it makes their cultures more diverse. Here we assume that the innovation is a new state of a cultural feature of a single individual-the innovator-and study how the innovation spreads through the networks of the individuals. For infinite regular lattices in one (1D) and two dimensions (2D), we find that initially successful innovation spreads linearly with time t, but in the long-time limit it spreads diffusively (similar to t(1/2)) in 1D and sub-diffusively (similar to t/ln t) in 2D. For finite lattices, the growth curves for the number of adopters are typically concave functions of t. For random graphs with a finite number of nodes N, we argue that the classical S-shaped growth curves result from a trade-off between the average connectivity K of the graph and the per-feature diversity q. A large q is needed to reduce the pace of the initial spreading of the innovation and thus delimit the early-adopters stage, whereas a large K is necessary to ensure the onset of the take-off stage at which the number of adopters grows superlinearly with t. In an infinite random graph we find that the number of adopters of a successful innovation scales with t(gamma) with gamma = 1 for K > 2 and 1/2 < gamma < 1 for K = 2. We suggest that the exponent. may be a useful index to characterize the process of diffusion of successful innovations in diverse scenarios.",
A network study exploring factors that promote or erode interaction among diverse community health workers in rural Ethiopia,HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING,Nov 2015,2015,"Task shifting in response to the health workforce shortage has resulted in community-based health workers taking on increasing responsibility. Community health workers are expected to work collaboratively, though they are often a heterogeneous group with a wide range of training and experience. Interpersonal relationships are at the very core of effective teamwork, yet relational variables have seldom been the focus of health systems research in low resource, rural settings. This article helps fill this knowledge gap by exploring the dyadic level, or relational, characteristics of community maternal and newborn health workers and the individual and collective influence of these characteristics on interaction patterns. Network data were collected from community health workers (N = 194) in seven rural kebeles of Amhara region, Ethiopia from November 2011 to January 2012. Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was used to fit regression models for frequency of work interactions, a proxy for teamwork. Strong and consistent evidence was found in support of Trust and Past training together as important relational factors for work interactions; less consistent evidence was found across sites in support of Homophily, Distance and Shared motivations. Our findings also point to a typology of network structure across sites, where one set of networks was characterized by denser and stronger health worker ties relative to their counterparts. Our results suggest that the development of interventions that promote trust and incorporate cross-cadre training is an important step in encouraging collective action. Moreover, assessing the structure of health worker networks may be an effective means of evaluating health systems strengthening efforts in rural, low-resource settings.",
Homophily in the career mobility of China's political elite,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Nov 2015,2015,"We argue that leadership promotion in China's political elite relies on homophily for signals of trustworthiness and future cooperative behavior more than on economic performance. We first point to the limitation of the economic performance argument from within the framework of China's specific M-form state structure, and then we proffer a sociological explanation for why higher-level elites in China rely on homophilous associations in recruiting middle-level elites to the top positions of state. Using a unique dataset covering China's provincial leaders from 1979 to 2011, we develop a homophily index focusing on joint origin, joint education and joint work experience. We trace personal similarities in these respects between provincial leaders and members of China's supreme decision-making body, the Politbureau's Standing Committee. We then provide robust evidence confirming the persisting impact of homophilous associations on promotion patterns in post-reform China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
How friends affect user behaviors? An exploration of social relation analysis for recommendation,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,Nov 2015,2015,"Incorporating the influence of social relationships effectively is fundamental to social recommendation (SR). However, most of the SR algorithms are based on the homophily assumption, where they ignored friends' different influence on users and users' different willingness to be influenced, which may make improper influence information integrated and harm the recommendation results. To address this, we propose a unified framework to properly incorporate the influence of social relationships into recommendation by the guidance of buddy (friends who have strong influence on user) and susceptibility (the willingness to be influenced) mining. Specifically, the Social Influence Propagation (SIP) method is proposed to identify each user's buddies and susceptibility and the Social Influence based Recommendation model is proposed to generate the final recommendation. Experiments on the real-world data demonstrate that the proposed framework can better utilize users' social relationships, resulting in increased recommendation accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Homophily and social influence among online casual game players,TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS,Nov 2015,2015,"Homophily and social influence are the main explanations for why there are more ties among people who have similar socio-demographic or behavioral characteristics. Homophily refers to the phenomenon that people are more likely to make relational ties with others who are similar to themselves than those who are not, whereas social influence refers to the phenomenon that an individual's behavior is likely to become more similar to that of her friends over time. It is important to study both homophily and social influence processes of a social network because each process can lead to different structural characteristics for a social network; homophily can lead to separation among the members of a network, whereas social influence can lead to network-wide uniformity. In this study, we examine homophily and social influence processes among online casual game players. Specifically, we ask whether an online casual game player tends to be friends with other online casual game players who have similar game genre preferences and whether a player's genre preferences and gaming frequencies become more similar to those of her Kongregate friends over time. For this study, demographic attributes, game genre preferences, gaming frequencies, and relational ties for 2488 game players were collected for two time periods from Kongregate. The panel data were analyzed with RSiena, the R version of SIENA (Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis), a social network analysis program used for social network panel data. The results suggest that there might not be strong homophily and social influence processes operating among the game players in the sampled network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Soaking It Up: Absorptive Capacity in Interorganizational New Product Development Teams,JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT,Nov 2015,2015,"Prior research has acknowledged the importance of an organization's absorptive capacitythe ability to acquire new knowledge and information, assimilate, transform, and exploit itfor innovation purposes. Because innovations are usually developed by project teams, this suggests that absorptive capacity, as a construct, may also be usefully applied at the team level. Consequently, this study developed a measure for team-level absorptive capacity, investigated the potential influencing factors, and examined its relationship to team effectiveness in terms of product innovativeness in an interorganizational context. Specifically, building on the theory of homophily and information and decision-making theories, three factors (social-category similarity, work-style similarity, and knowledge complementarity between the recipient and the partner organization teams) were identified as likely antecedents of team absorptive capacity. The hypotheses were tested on data from 98 interorganizational new product development teams and included responses from team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. With regard to the antecedents of team absorptive capacity in interorganizational settings, the results showed a significant positive association with partners' work-style similarity and an inverted U-shaped relationship with partners' knowledge complementarity. Social-category similarity was not significantly associated with team absorptive capacity. We also examined whether team absorptive capacity was related to interorganizational team effectiveness and found a significant positive relationship between team absorptive capacity and product innovativeness. The study demonstrates that absorptive is indeed related to team effectiveness outcomes in an interorganizational context, which underlines the importance of team-level absorptive capacity for product innovation management and suggests paying more attention to the lower levels of absorptive capacity.",
Sampling Motif-Constrained Ensembles of Networks,PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS,Oct 29 2015,2015,"The statistical significance of network properties is conditioned on null models which satisfy specified properties but that are otherwise random. Exponential random graph models are a principled theoretical framework to generate such constrained ensembles, but which often fail in practice, either due to model inconsistency or due to the impossibility to sample networks from them. These problems affect the important case of networks with prescribed clustering coefficient or number of small connected subgraphs (motifs). In this Letter we use the Wang-Landau method to obtain a multicanonical sampling that overcomes both these problems. We sample, in polynomial time, networks with arbitrary degree sequences from ensembles with imposed motifs counts. Applying this method to social networks, we investigate the relation between transitivity and homophily, and we quantify the correlation between different types of motifs, finding that single motifs can explain up to 60% of the variation of motif profiles.",
Quantifying the Role of Homophily in Human Cooperation Using Multiplex Evolutionary Game Theory,PLOS ONE,Oct 23 2015,2015,"Nature shows as human beings live and grow inside social structures. This assumption allows us to explain and explore how it may shape most of our behaviours and choices, and why we are not just blindly driven by instincts: our decisions are based on more complex cognitive reasons, based on our connectedness on different spaces. Thus, human cooperation emerges from this complex nature of social network. Our paper, focusing on the evolutionary dynamics, is intended to explore how and why it happens, and what kind of impact is caused by homophily among people. We investigate the evolution of human cooperation using evolutionary game theory on multiplex. Multiplexity, as an extra dimension of analysis, allows us to unveil the hidden dynamics and observe non-trivial patterns within a population across network layers. More importantly, we find a striking role of homophily, as the higher the homophily between individuals, the quicker is the convergence towards cooperation in the social dilemma. The simulation results, conducted both macroscopically and microscopically across the network layers in the multiplex, show quantitatively the role of homophily in human cooperation.",
Network closure among sellers and buyers in social commerce community,ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,OCT-NOV 2015,2015,"Social commerce communities connect sellers and buyers and allow them to seek and share product information. Although the extant literature has realized its economic value, there has been little research on the antecedents of network closure in social commerce community with longitudinal network data. Based on the evolving network data from Taobao.com and network closure theory, this research analyzes network closure among sellers and buyers in social commerce community and we find that the drivers of network closure in social commerce communities vary across different types of relationships. Specifically, (1) from the buyers' perspective, they are more likely to follow other buyers and sellers through observational learning and contagion; (2) from the sellers' perspective, the homophily, reciprocity, and structural equivalence are the general mechanisms that drive them following both buyers and sellers; (3) the results from the robustness checks show that the findings would not be affected by the sample size or the duration of the observations.This study contributes to the ongoing study of social networks analysis in social shopping and social commerce. Furthermore, the ties studied in this research connect both sellers and buyers, which are different from the ties of friendship in most social network literatures. Findings from this research will also help marketers better understand how social commerce community networks evolve and adjust their relationship management strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Social cohesion and knowledge diffusion: understanding the embeddedness-homophily association,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,Oct 2015,2015,"The idea of social relations shaping business and production relations between economic agents is not new. Production relations may become socially embedded and may exhibit homophily. We work towards understanding an embeddedness-homophily connection with the support of a case study of the decline of a formerly dominant handloom weavers' community in Kerala, the Saliyars. We demonstrate that there is a spectrum of cohesion along which network links can be categorised, and that it is homophilous-embeddedness that truly defines cohesion. We build the evidence that the Saliyars' networks were characterised by 'homophilous-embeddedness', which, we show, has been relayed across generations. Due to this attribute, the Saliyars are placed as an example that counters the standard line in the literature that community cohesion has been historically congruent to technological progress and knowledge diffusion in handloom in India.",
Categories and networks in jazz evolution: The overlap between bandleaders' jazz sidemen from 1930 to 1969,POETICS,Oct 2015,2015,"This paper expands on Peterson's process model for historical changes in jazz. Peterson suggests that, given certain circumstances, musical genres migrate from 'low-brow' to 'high-brow'. I test this proposition for jazz by investigating whether bandleaders were associated through the same sidemen ('sidemen overlap') across time, and the underlying logics leading to these overlaps. I confirm Peterson's model to the extent that sidemen overlap shifts from a 'commercial' logic to a 'style-based' logic. From 1930 to 1949, sidemen overlap between bandleaders is mainly predicted by recording session volumes (akin to 'commercial logic'). From 1945 to 1969, style similarity emerges as an important predictor of sidemen overlap. I extend Peterson's process model by providing a more nuanced account, based on social networks. I show substantive collaboration across styles. As a consequence, stylistic shifts are not as abrupt as originally depicted. I also explore how past associations become increasingly stronger in terms of explaining sidemen overlap. Furthermore, race emerges as an important variable in explaining the same phenomenon. During the thirties, non-African-American homophily is high. After this period, African-American homophily increases steadily until the late fifties, decreasing again during the sixties.

"Substance Use Homophily Among Geosocial Networking Application Using Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men",ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR,Oct 2015,2015,"Geosocial networking applications (GSN apps) represent important virtual contexts in which gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) seek affiliation. These apps allow users to create and view public profiles, send photos, and text messages, and connect with other users based on shared interests and geographic proximity. The present study examined substance use homophily among a sample of 295 MSM recruited via a popular GSN app. Comparisons of social network members met via GSN app versus elsewhere and associations between both individual and network characteristics and recent binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit substance use were explored using bivariate tests of association and multivariate logistic regression analyses. High rates of recent binge drinking (59 %), marijuana use (37 %), and illicit substance use (27 %) were observed among participants. GSN app use greater than 1 year and showing naked chest or abs in a profile picture were positively associated with recent illicit substance use. In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictors of binge drinking (AOR 3.81; 95 % CI 1.86-7.80), marijuana use (AOR 4.12; 95 % CI 2.22-7.64), and illicit substance use (AOR 6.45; 95 % CI 3.26-12.79) were the presence of a social network member who also engaged in these behaviors. Social network interventions that target binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit substance use may be delivered via GSN apps to reduce the prevalence of substance use and related risks among MSM in these virtual contexts.",
Effect of Media Usage Selection on Social Mobilization Speed: Facebook vs E-Mail,PLOS ONE,Sep 30 2015,2015,"Social mobilization is a process that enlists a large number of people to achieve a goal within a limited time, especially through the use of social media. There is increasing interest in understanding the factors that affect the speed of social mobilization. Based on the Langley Knights competition data set, we analyzed the differences in mobilization speed between users of Facebook and e-mail. We include other factors that may influence mobilization speed (gender, age, timing, and homophily of information source) in our model as control variables in order to isolate the effect of such factors. We show that, in this experiment, although more people used e-mail to recruit, the mobilization speed of Facebook users was faster than that of those that used e-mail. We were also able to measure and show that the mobilization speed for Facebook users was on average seven times faster compared to e-mail before controlling for other factors. After controlling for other factors, we show that Facebook users were 1.84 times more likely to register compared to e-mail users in the next period if they have not done so at any point in time. This finding could provide useful insights for future social mobilization efforts.",
The role of social networks in the development of overweight and obesity among adults: a scoping review,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,Sep 30 2015,2015,"Background: Although it is increasingly acknowledged that social networks are important to our understanding of overweight and obesity, there is limited understanding about the processes by which such networks shapetheir progression. This paper reports the findings of a scoping review of the literature that sought to identify the key processes through which social networks are understood to influence the development of overweight and obesity.Methods: A scoping review was conducted. Forty five papers were included in the final review, the findings of which were synthesised to provide an overview of the main processes through which networks have been understood to influence the development of overweight and obesity. Results: Included papers addressed a wide range of research questions framed around six types of networks: a paired network (one's spouse or intimate partner); friends and family (including work colleagues and people within social clubs); ephemeral networks in shared public spaces (such as fellow shoppers in a supermarket or diners in a restaurant); people living within the same geographical region; peers (including co-workers, fellow students, fellow participants in a weight loss programme); and cultural groups (often related toethnicity). As individuals are embedded in many of these different types of social networks at any one time, the pathways of influence from social networks to the development of patterns of overweight and obesity are likely to be complex and interrelated. Included papers addressed a diverse set of issues: body weight trends over time; body size norms or preferences; weight loss and management; physical activity patterns; and dietary patterns.Discussion: Three inter-related processes were identified: social contagion (whereby the network in which people are embedded influences their weight or weight influencing behaviours), social capital (whereby sense of belonging and social support influence weight or weight influencing behaviours), and social selection (whereby a person's network might develop according to his or her weight).Conclusions: The findings have important implications for understanding about methods to target the spread of obesity, indicating that much greater attention needs to be paid to the social context in which people make decisions about their weight and weight influencing behaviours.",
Competition between Homophily and Information Entropy Maximization in Social Networks,PLOS ONE,Sep 3 2015,2015,"In social networks, it is conventionally thought that two individuals with more overlapped friends tend to establish a new friendship, which could be stated as homophily breeding new connections. While the recent hypothesis of maximum information entropy is presented as the possible origin of effective navigation in small-world networks. We find there exists a competition between information entropy maximization and homophily in local structure through both theoretical and experimental analysis. This competition suggests that a newly built relationship between two individuals with more common friends would lead to less information entropy gain for them. We demonstrate that in the evolution of the social network, both of the two assumptions coexist. The rule of maximum information entropy produces weak ties in the network, while the law of homophily makes the network highly clustered locally and the individuals would obtain strong and trust ties. A toy model is also presented to demonstrate the competition and evaluate the roles of different rules in the evolution of real networks. Our findings could shed light on the social network modeling from a new perspective.",
Partnership Ties Shape Friendship Networks: A Dynamic Social Network Study,SOCIAL FORCES,Sep 2015,2015,"Partnership ties shape friendship networks through different social forces. First, partnership ties drive clustering in friendship networks: individuals who are in a partnership tend to have common friends and befriend other couples. Second, partnership ties influence the level of homophily in these emerging friendship clusters. Partners tend to be similar in a number of attributes (homogamy). If one partner selects friends based on preferences for homophily, then the other partner may befriend the same person regardless of whether they also have homophilic preferences. Thus, two homophilic ties emerge based on a single partner's preferences. This amplification of homophily can be observed in many attributes (e.g., ethnicity, religion, age). Gender homophily, however, may be de-amplified, as the gender of partners differs in heterosexual partnerships. In our study, we follow dynamic friendship formation among 126 individuals and their cohabiting partners in a university-related graduate housing community over a period of nine months (N = 2,250 self-reported friendship relations). We find that partnership ties strongly shape the dynamic process of friendship formation. They are a main driver of local network clustering and explain a striking amount of homophily.",
A multi-source integration framework for user occupation inference in social media systems,WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Sep 2015,2015,"With the rapid development of social media applications, lots of users are connected with friends online, and their daily life and opinions are recorded. Social media provides us an unprecedented way to collect and analyze billions of users' information. Proper user attribute identification or profile inference becomes increasingly attractive and feasible. However, the flourishing social records also pose great challenge in effective feature selection and integration for user profile inference, which is mainly caused by the text diversity and complex community structures. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to infer the user occupation from his/her social activities recorded in the micro-blog system, which is a multi-source integration framework that combines both content and network information. We first identify some beneficial content features, and propose a machine learning classification model, named content model. We proceed to exploit the social network information, which tailors a community discovery based latent dimension solution to extract community-based feature, and utilizes the neighbor predictions for inference updating. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on a large real-life micro-blog dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our integrated model for the occupation inference task, verify the effect of homophily in user interaction records, and reveal different effects of heterogeneous interactive networks.",
Multilevel animal societies can emerge from cultural transmission,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Sep 2015,2015,"Multilevel societies, containing hierarchically nested social levels, are remarkable social structures whose origins are unclear. The social relationships of sperm whales are organized in a multilevel society with an upper level composed of clans of individuals communicating using similar patterns of clicks (codas). Using agent-based models informed by an 18-year empirical study, we show that clans are unlikely products of stochastic processes (genetic or cultural drift) but likely originate from cultural transmission via biased social learning of codas. Distinct clusters of individuals with similar acoustic repertoires, mirroring the empirical clans, emerge when whales learn preferentially the most common codas (conformism) from behaviourally similar individuals (homophily). Cultural transmission seems key in the partitioning of sperm whales into sympatric clans. These findings suggest that processes similar to those that generate complex human cultures could not only be at play in non-human societies but also create multilevel social structures in the wild.",
"Monolingualism, integration and assortative mixing in social networks: A literature review",TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE,Sep 2015,2015,"Afrikaans education institutions are increasingly coming under fire, because the use of Afrikaans is believed to lead to a lack of integration between different population groups in South Africa. Afrikaans is seen as a white language, while it is argued that black students attend classes in English, which means that the separation of students in terms of language also allegedly leads to a separation in terms of race. The proposal is then that by removing Afrikaans as a medium of instruction, South African education institutions will become integrated.This article critically engages with this view from the perspective of complex network theory by investigating community formation in networks. The concepts of modularity and transitivity or clustering, as developed within the field of complex network theory, are discussed with reference to examples of different types of networks. Modularity provides a way of quantifying whether distinct groups of nodes emerge in a network, while transitivity refers to the formation of triangles in a network. Modularity and transitivity are calculated for a number of real networks, and compared with Erdos and Renyi (1960) type network models where link formation occurs at random. It is shown that community formation is not peculiar to South African society or even social networks in general, but is a characteristic of complex networks, which include social networks as well as technological, biological and information networks.Community formation arises partly as a result of assortativity or homophily, which means that similar nodes tend to form links with each other. Homophily in social networks can be based on language, but also manifests on the grounds of race, class, income group, geographical location and so on. An overview is given of a number of studies that investigated community formation in social networks, including in terms of language, such as Blondel et al.'s (2008) study of language communities in Belgium, or Leskovec and Horvitz's (2007) study of the Microsoft Instant Messaging (IM) network Although it is shown that quantitative evidence exists that language does lead to the formation of distinct communities, some studies of community formation in the monolingual environment of the United States are also discussed, including Moody's (2001) study of race relations amongst high school students, where it was shown that homogenous communities also emerge without language being a variable. In addition, some quantitative evidence is also provided for community formation based on age and geographical location.The conclusion the article arrives at is that integration will not be brought about by removing Afrikaans from education institutions, since the monolingual environment of the United States is still characterized by separate communities that are formed on the basis of race. The wide-spread occurrence of communities in networks indicates that it is a salient feature of networks, and that when removing one variable, another will still result in the formation of distinct communities. A brief discussion is also given of problems associated with the formation of social ties based on heterophily, i.e. where social ties are formed based on difference rather than similarity.",
Network Dynamics: How Can We Find Patients Like Us?,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Sep 2015,2015,"Social networks have been shown to affect health. Because online social networking makes it easier for individuals to interact with experientially similar others in regard to health issues and to exchange social support, there has been an increasing effort to understand how networks function. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to how these networks are formed. In this paper, we examine the driving forces behind patients' social network formation and evolution. We argue that patients' health-related traits influence their social connections and that the patients' network layout is shaped by their cognitive capabilities and their network embeddedness. By studying longitudinal data from 1,322 individuals and their communication ties in an online healthcare social network, we find that firsthand disease experience, which provides knowledge of the disease, increases the probability that patients will find experientially similar others and establish communication ties. Patients' cognitive abilities, including the information load that they can process and the range of social ties that they can manage, however, limit their network growth. In addition, we find that patients' efforts to reach out for additional social resources are associated with their embeddedness in the network and the cost of maintaining connections. Practical implications of our findings are discussed.",
Predicting the evolution of social networks with life cycle events,TRANSPORTATION,Sep 2015,2015,"This paper presents a model of social network evolution, to predict and simulate changes in social networks induced by lifecycle events. We argue that social networks change with lifecycle events, and we extend a model of friendship selection to incorporate these dynamics of personal social networks. The model uses theories of homophily and reciprocity and is formulated in a random utility maximization framework to predict the formation of social ties between individuals in the population. It is then extended to predict the evolution of social networks in response to life cycle events. The model is estimated using attribute data of a national sample and an event-based retrospective dataset collected in 2009 and 2011 respectively. Findings suggest that homophily has a strong effect on the formation of new ties. However, heterophily also plays a role in maintaining existing ties. Although the motivation of this research stems from incorporating social network dynamics in large-scale travel behaviour micro-simulation models, the research can be used in a variety of fields for similar purposes.",
Content and perception of weight-related maternal messages communicated to adult daughters,EATING AND WEIGHT DISORDERS-STUDIES ON ANOREXIA BULIMIA AND OBESITY,Sep 2015,2015,"This study examined communication between mothers and overweight daughters on weight or weight-related behaviors through the perspective of adult daughters.Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze in-depth individual interviews conducted with 15 adult daughters.Mothers who actively engaged in weight management behaviors, such as dieting and exercising regularly, transmitted these behaviors through modeling and served as continuous sources of verbal guidance on the topic. Weight management was discussed frequently and explicitly. Daughters relied on mothers for motivation in the form of supportive statements consisting of specific recommendations on weight management practices, encouragement to attempt or continue weight management practices, empathy with the struggle of managing weight, and affirmation of practices conducive to weight management. Mothers who did not engage in weight management behaviors were not viewed as credible sources for advice on diet and exercise. Daughters did most of the advice giving and modeling on weight management behaviors. Weight management was discussed infrequently and cautiously. Daughters perceived weight-related messages from mothers as unsolicited and critical.The results suggest that shared lifestyle goals among family members are important for facilitating supportive communication and engagement in health-promoting behaviors and have implications for family-based weight management interventions.",
Factors that affect the formation of networks for collaborative learning: an empirical study conducted at a Chilean university,Ingeniare. Revista chilena de ingeniería,2015-09,2015,"This article shows the results of applying social network analysis techniques to explore the antecedents in the formation of collaborative learning networks in Chile. Immersed in learning analytics, the paper indicates a set of individual variables of students that explain the relationship structure between them for the purpose of collaborating in the study. In particular, the study used a Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure to analyze a network of students belonging to a Chilean university. The results support the existence of three antecedents in the formation of a network to collaborate in the learning: homophily, closeness in the academic performance and looseness in the happiness level.",
When Bias Binds: Effect of Implicit Outgroup Bias on Ingroup Affiliation,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,Sep 2015,2015,"We tested a novel process we term implicit homophily in which perceivers' implicit outgroup bias shapes their affiliative responses toward ingroup targets with outgroup friends as a function of perceived similarity. Across 4 studies, we tested implicit homophily in the context of racial groups. We found that White participants with higher implicit anti-Black bias reported less affiliative responses toward White targets with Black friends compared with White targets with White friends, and this effect persisted above and beyond the effects of implicit pro-White bias and explicit racial bias (Studies 1-3). We further found evidence that this relationship between implicit anti-Black bias and affiliation exists because participants infer how comfortable targets are around outgroup members (Preliminary Study) and use this information to infer similarity on this dimension (Studies 1-3). Our findings also suggested that stigma transference and expectancy violation were not viable alternative mediators (Preliminary Study and Study 1). Finally, women's implicit anti-Black bias predicted their likelihood of having Facebook friends with Black friends, providing ecological and behavioral evidence of implicit homophily (Study 4). Implications for research on stigma by association, extended contact, affiliation, and network formation are discussed.",
Compressed knowledge transfer via factorization machine for heterogeneous collaborative recommendation,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,Sep 2015,2015,"Collaborative recommendation has attracted various research works in recent years. However, an important problem setting, i.e., ""a user examined several items but only rated a few"", has not received much attention yet. We coin this problem heterogeneous collaborative recommendation (HCR) from the perspective of users' heterogeneous feedbacks of implicit examinations and explicit ratings. In order to fully exploit such different types of feedbacks, we propose a novel and generic solution called compressed knowledge transfer via factorization machine (CKT-FM). Specifically, we assume that the compressed knowledge of user homophily and item correlation, i.e., user groups and item sets behind two types of feedbacks, are similar and then design a two-step transfer learning solution including compressed knowledge mining and integration. Our solution is able to transfer high quality knowledge via noise reduction, to model rich pairwise interactions among individual-level and cluster-level entities, and to adapt the potential inconsistent knowledge from implicit feedbacks to explicit feedbacks. Furthermore, the analysis on time complexity and space complexity shows that our solution is much more efficient than the state-of-the-art method for heterogeneous feedbacks. Extensive empirical studies on two large data sets show that our solution is significantly better than the state-of-the-art non-transfer learning method w.r.t. recommendation accuracy, and is much more efficient than that of leveraging the raw implicit examinations directly instead of compressed knowledge w.r.t. CPU time and memory usage. Hence, our CKT-FM strikes a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer in HCR. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Challenging Race-Based Stereotypes about Gay and Bisexual Men's Sexual Behavior and Perceived Penis Size and Size Satisfaction,SEXUALITY RESEARCH AND SOCIAL POLICY,Sep 2015,2015,"Racial prejudice and stereotyping in gay and bisexual communities may be important contextual factors that contribute to racial disparities in HIV. In an effort to challenge race-based stereotypes regarding gay and bisexual men's sexuality, we sought to determine the extent to which race and ethnicity were associated with (1) racial homophily (i.e., same-race partnerships), (2) sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, condomless anal sex (CAS), sexual position (top/versatile/bottom)), and (3) perceived penis size and size satisfaction. Data were taken from a survey of 1,009 gay and bisexual men recruited using a street-intercept method at gay, lesbian, and bisexual community events in NYC in 2006-15 % Black, 61 % White, 18 % Latino, and 6 % Asian/Pacific Islander (mean age, 35.7). There was strong evidence of racial homophily (i.e., having a partner of the same race) among men who were in relationships, particularly for White and Black men. Race and ethnicity was largely unassociated with multiple dimensions of sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, CAS, sexual positioning). Although we observed some racial and ethnic differences in perceived penis size that were consistent with stereotypes, the magnitudes of the differences were insufficient to justify the stereotype. As well, there were no significant differences with regard to satisfaction with penis size or lying to others about penis size. The disproportionate HIV prevalence among Black and Latino men does not appear to be as a result of differences in sexual behavior (e.g., CAS, number of partners) and race-based sexual stereotypes were largely unsupported by empirical data.",
All My Friends Are Doing It: Potentially Offensive Sexual Behavior Perpetration Within Adolescent Social Networks,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE,Sep 2015,2015,"The current study used social network analysis to investigate peer network and individual predictors of potentially offensive sexual behaviors among high school students. Ninth-grade students (n=308; 158 girls) completed surveys assessing their perpetration of potentially offensive sexual behaviors against their peers, as well as measures of their sexualized gender stereotypes and propensity to self-monitor. Participants selected up to eight of their closest friends from a roster. Results revealed homophily of potentially offensive sexual behaviors, such that adolescents perpetrated similar amounts of physical/verbal, electronic, and homophobic behaviors as their friends. Characteristics of the peer network (e.g., mean network perpetration, centrality of individual, and gender composition) and the individual adolescent (e.g., gender, sexualized gender stereotypes, self-monitoring) predicted adolescents' own behavior.",
Generalized scale-free homophilic network,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C,Sep 2015,2015,"We propose a simple network growth process where the preferential attachment contains two essential parameters: homophily, namely, the tendency of sites to link with similar ones, and the number of attaching neighbors. It jointly generalizes the Barabasi-Albert model and the scale-free homophilic model with a control parameter which tunes the importance of the homophily on preferential attachment process. Our results support a detailed discussion about different kinds of correlation, in special a fitness correlation introduced in this paper, and comparisons between BA model, scale-free homophilic model, and our present model considering its topological properties: degree distribution, time dependence of the connectivity and clustering co-efficient.",
Friendship-making: Exploring Network Formations through the Narratives of Irish Highly Qualified Migrants in Britain,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,Aug 24 2015,2015,"The paper, drawing on narrative analysis of qualitative research with Irish highly qualified migrants in Britain, examines the processes of friendship-making in contexts of mobility. In so doing, I consider what stories of making new friends in new places, reveal about interconnections between selection opportunities but also obstacles, as well as the role of preferences and shared interests. My work contributes to the recent resurgence of interest in place by exploring the salience of proximate, situated, local relationships as sources of emotional support and sociality, even among migrant professionals. Adopting a focus on friendship-making, I seek to go beyond a narrow notion of homophily-defined by an ethnic lens-to understand how migrants draw upon different aspects of identities to forge links and build relationships with a diverse range of people. The paper lies at the nexus of related but distinct bodies of literature-migration, social network analysis and friendship-to explore where, how, why and with who migrants form new friendship networks. I suggest that by connecting these approaches there is potential not only to develop a more thorough understanding of sociality in mobility but also to overcome some gaps within each of these approaches.",
The Relationship of Policymaking and Networking Characteristics among Leaders of Large Urban Health Departments,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Aug 2015,2015,"Background: The relationship between policy networks and policy development among local health departments (LHDs) is a growing area of interest to public health practitioners and researchers alike. In this study, we examine policy activity and ties between public health leadership across large urban health departments. Methods: This study uses data from a national profile of local health departments as well as responses from a survey sent to three staff members (local health official, chief of policy, chief science officer) in each of 16 urban health departments in the United States. Network questions related to frequency of contact with health department personnel in other cities. Using exponential random graph models, network density and centrality were examined, as were patterns of communication among those working on several policy areas using exponential random graph models. Results: All 16 LHDs were active in communicating about chronic disease as well as about use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD). Connectedness was highest among local health officials (density = .55), and slightly lower for chief science officers (d = .33) and chiefs of policy (d = .29). After accounting for organizational characteristics, policy homophily (i.e., when two network members match on a single characteristic) and tenure were the most significant predictors of formation of network ties. Conclusion: Networking across health departments has the potential for accelerating the adoption of public health policies. This study suggests similar policy interests and formation of connections among senior leadership can potentially drive greater connectedness among other staff.",
The Interrelation of Immigrants' Interethnic Ties and Socioeconomic Status in Germany. An Autoregressive Panel Analysis,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POPULATION-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE DEMOGRAPHIE,Aug 2015,2015,"This paper analyses the causality between interethnic ties and socioeconomic status (SES) for Italian, Turkish and former Yugoslavian immigrants in Germany. Referring to social capital theory and its inherent problem of homophily, the interrelation between these two constructs remains ambiguous. The data come from the German socioeconomic panel study. After demonstrating the drawbacks of existing empirical studies on this issue, results of fixed effects panel regressions and autoregressive cross-lagged panel models (ARM) with latent variables are presented. In this respect, the latter are considered more appropriate to tackle the formulated questions. To counter common criticism of ARM, an unmeasured variable model is computed in order to control for spurious relationships. After accounting for simultaneity, reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity, the interethnic ties of immigrants positively influence the respondents' SES. In the strictest test, no significant reverse effect remains. Hence, the results support social capital theory.",
Do Your Online Friends Make You Pay? A Randomized Field Experiment on Peer Influence in Online Social Networks,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Aug 2015,2015,"Demonstrating compelling causal evidence of the existence and strength of peer-to-peer influence has become the holy grail of modern research in online social networks. In these networks, it has been consistently demonstrated that user characteristics and behavior tend to cluster both in space and in time. There are multiple well-known rival mechanisms that compete to be the explanation for this observed clustering. These range from peer influence to homophily to other unobservable external stimuli. These multiple mechanisms lead to similar observational data, yet have vastly different policy implications. In this paper, we present a novel randomized experiment that tests the existence of causal peer influence in the general population-one that did not involve subject recruitment for experimentation-of a particular large-scale online social network. We utilize a unique social feature to exogenously induce adoption of a paid service among a group of randomly selected users, and in the process develop a clean exogenous randomization of treatment and control groups. A variety of nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric approaches, ranging from resampling-based inference to ego-level random effects to logistic regression to survival models, yield close to identical, statistically and economically significant estimates of peer influence in the general population of a freemium social network. Our estimates show that peer influence causes more than a 60% increase in odds of buying the service due to the influence coming from an adopting friend. In addition, we find that users with a smaller number of friends experience stronger relative increase in the adoption likelihood due to influence from their peers as compared to the users with a larger number of friends. Our nonparametric resampling procedure-based estimates are helpful in situations of networked data that violate independence assumptions. We establish that peer influence is a powerful force in getting users from free to premium levels, a known challenge in freemium communities.",
Birds of a Feather: A Case Study of Friendship Networks of Mainland Chinese College Students in Hong Kong,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,Aug 2015,2015,"We examine the formation process of friendship networks of Mainland Chinese undergraduates in Hong Kong. The data comes from a 2011 survey of Mainland undergraduates at a university in Hong Kong and from in-depth interviews with students. We found a strong in-group pattern in the friendship networks of these students. More than 60% do not have good local friends. On a campus where nearly 90% of the students are locals, on average, only 18% of the good friends named by Mainland students are locals. We find that cultural differencessuch as the language barrier, differences in values and ideologies, and differences in academic orientation and future plandiscourage formation of intergroup friendship. But intergroup contacts, as indicated by participation in local organizations, have positive effects on intergroup friendship formation. Both contact opportunities and their timing (i.e., when they become available) are important. During their first year, Mainland students have many more opportunities to interact with other Mainlanders than with local students. This may also be an important factor accounting for the strong in-group pattern in Mainland students' friendship networks.",
The Search for Suitable Homicide Co-Offenders Among Gang Members,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE,Aug 2015,2015,"Little is known about homicide co-offending networks at the individual gang member level. Of particular interest is whether and to what degree gang members who are selected to participate in murder are different from those who are not. The current study constructed the co-offense network of 18 participants from the Incarcerated Serious and Violent Young Offender Study who were identified as members of a prominent gang within British Columbia, Canada, referred to as the BC Gang. This gang started to form not long before seven offenders together committed a homicide that was orchestrated by the founder and leader of the BC Gang. After this offense, some of these seven offenders became the most central actors within a large network of co-offenders (n = 137) that was measured at four time periods over a 20-year period. Over this period, a second murder, like the first, was orchestrated by the leader of the BC Gang, offering a rare glimpse into the co-offending recruitment decisions made by a high ranking gang member for two separate homicides. Although only 25% of the 137 co-offenders are BC gang members (n = 35), 100% of the offenders selected for a homicide were members of this gang (n = 13). The network contained 8 separate components at the final measurement period, but all 13 homicide offenders were connected to the same network component of 48 individuals.",
The Structure of Age Homophily in Co-Offending Groups,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE,Aug 2015,2015,"This article examines age homophily among co-offenders, using data on approximately 440,000 co-offenses recorded by police in Canada during 2006 to 2009. Log-linear models for social mobility tables are applied to an 86-by-86 table of frequencies of co-offending among year-of-age groups for individuals from 3 to 88 years old. The results indicate strong age homophily for co-offenders of all ages, but decreasing with age. There is further structuration into four age groups: children (3-11 years), youth (12-17 years), young adults (18-45 years), and older adults (46-88 years). The Fagin hypothesis that offenders below the age of criminal responsibility are particularly attractive as co-offenders for older offenders is disconfirmed.",
Ethnic Homophily and Triad Closure: Mapping Internal Gang Structure Using Exponential Random Graph Models,JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL JUSTICE,Aug 2015,2015,"Previous studies indicate the importance of similarities between street gang members in terms of ethnicity for mapping the patterns of co-offending relationships within gangs. Individual members are more likely to co-offend with other members who are from the same ethnicity. Past studies, however, do not appropriately account for the fact that correlation between attributes of co-offending gang members may be driven by alternative mechanisms. Most importantly, the presence of clustering in networks can dramatically affect the assessment and make us believe that homophilythe deliberate choice to co-offend with others from the same ethnic groupis important while in fact it is not. In this article, we recreate the internal structure of a London-based street gang with exponential random graph (ERG) models. Our results refine the role of ethnicity for co-offending within gangs. While homophily is still prevalent, the effect diminishes when triad closurethe tendency for two individuals to offend with each other when they also offend with a common third personis considered. Furthermore, we extend existing ERG specifications and investigate the interaction between ethnic homophily and triad closure. Findings indicate that ethnic homophily is even stronger when it is embedded in co-offending triads.",
The impact of perceived similarity on tacit coordination: propensity for matching and aversion to decoupling choices,FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,Jul 28 2015,2015,"Homophily, or ""love for similar others,"" has been shown to play a fundamental role in the formation of interpersonal ties and social networks. Yet no study has investigated whether perceived similarities can affect tacit coordination. We had 68 participants attempt to maximize real monetary earnings by choosing between a safe but low paying option (that could be obtained with certainty) and a potentially higher paying but ""risky"" one, which depended on the choice of a matched counterpart. While making their choices participants were mutually informed of whether their counterparts similarly or dissimilarly identified with three person-descriptive words as themselves. We found that similarity increased the rate of ""risky"" choices only when the game required counterparts to match their choices (stag hunt games). Conversely, similarity led to decreased risk rates when they were to tacitly decouple their choices (entry games). Notably, though similarity increased coordination in the matching environment, it did not did not increase it in the decoupling game. In spite of this, similarity increased (expected) payoffs across both coordination environments. This could shed light on why homophily is so successful as a social attractor. Finally, this propensity for matching and aversion to decoupling choices was not observed when participants ""liked"" their counterparts but were dissimilar to them. We thus conclude that the impact of similarity of coordination should not be reduced to ""liking"" others (i.e., social preferences) but it is also about predicting them.",
Lessons learned from applying social network analysis on an industrial Free/Libre/Open Source Software ecosystem,JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS,Jul 24 2015,2015,"Many software projects are no longer done in-house by a single organization. Instead, we are in a new age where software is developed by a networked community of individuals and organizations, which base their relations to each other on mutual interest. Paradoxically, recent research suggests that software development can actually be jointly-developed by rival firms. For instance, it is known that the mobile-device makers Apple and Samsung kept collaborating in open source projects while running expensive patent wars in the court. Taking a case study approach, we explore how rival firms collaborate in the open source arena by employing a multi-method approach that combines qualitative analysis of archival data (QA) withmining software repositories (MSR) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). While exploring collaborative processes within the OpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to Software Engineering research by exploring the role of groups, sub-communities and business models within a high-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results point out that competition for the same revenue model (i.e., operating conflicting business models) does not necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem. Moreover, while detecting the different sub-communities of the OpenStack community, we found out that the expected social tendency of developers to work with developers from same firm (i.e., homophony) did not hold within the OpenStack ecosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel, complex and unexplored open source case, this research also contributes to the management literature in coopetition strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich description on how heterogeneous actors within a high-networked ecosystem (involving individuals, startups, established firms and public organizations) joint-develop a complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source arena.",
Homophily in a Parental Network of the Top 100 Korean Rhythmic Gymnasts,RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT,Jul 22 2015,2015,,
Ethnic homophily perceptions as an emergent IHRM challenge: evidence from firms operating in Sri Lanka during the ethnic conflict,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT,Jul 20 2015,2015,"Ethnic conflict is a defining characteristic of the post-Cold War era and is prevalent particularly in emerging economies, areas of increasing interest to multinational enterprises. Yet little is known about the international human resource management challenges arising from such societal context. Utilizing social identity theory, we propose that ethnic homophily perceptions in the workplace - an employee's assessment that colleagues prefer working with ethnically similar others - is a reflection of the societal context and can be detrimental to the organization if not managed appropriately. We investigate whether contact theory offers insights to manage such perceptions. Drawing on a sample of 550 managers in Sri Lanka during a period of protracted ethnic conflict, we found that employee sensitivity to ethnic conflict in the societal context is positively related to ethnic homophily perceptions in the workplace, and that both ethnic diversity in workgroups and quality of work relationships serve to reduce perceptions of ethnic homophily.",
Downscaling Environmental Justice Analysis: Determinants of Household-Level Hazardous Air Pollutant Exposure in Greater Houston,ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,Jul 4 2015,2015,"Environmental justice (EJ) research has relied on ecological analyses of coarse-scale areal units to determine whether particular populations are disproportionately burdened by toxic risks. This article advances quantitative EJ research by (1) examining whether statistical associations found for geographic units translate to relationships at the household level; (2) testing competing explanations for distributional injustices never before investigated; (3) examining adverse health implications of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) exposures; and (4) applying an underutilized statistical technique appropriate for geographically clustered data. Our study makes these advances by using generalized estimating equations to examine distributive environmental inequities in the Greater Houston (Texas) metropolitan area, based on primary household-level survey data and census block-level cancer risk estimates of HAP exposure from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition to main statistical effects, interaction effects are modeled to examine whether minority racial or ethnic status modifies the effects of other variables on HAP cancer risk. In terms of main effects, Hispanic and black status as well as the desire to live close to public transit exhibit robust associations with HAP cancer risk. Interaction results reveal that homeownership and homophily (i.e., the desire to live among people culturally similar to oneself) are associated with higher HAP cancer risk among Hispanics and blacks but with lower risk among whites. Disproportionate risks experienced by Hispanics and blacks are attributable neither to dampened risk perceptions nor the desire to live close to work. These findings have implications for EJ research and practice in Greater Houston and elsewhere.",
Cultures of Caste and Rural Development in the Social Network of a South Indian Village,SAGE OPEN,JUL-SEP 2015,2015,"Cultures of caste in much of rural India have become entangled with institutions of rural development. In community-driven development, emphasis on ""local resource persons"" and ""community spokespersons"" has created new opportunities for brokerage and patronage within some villages, which interact with existing forms of authority and community afforded by caste identity and intra-caste headmanship. In this article, we study how these entangled cultures of caste and development translate into social network structures using data on friendship ties from a south Indian village. We find that although caste continues to be important in shaping community structures and leadership in the village's network, its influence varies across different communities. This fluidity of caste's influence on community network structures is argued to be the result of multiple distinct yet partially overlapping cultural-political forces, which include sharedness afforded by caste identity and new forms of difference and inequality effected through rural development.",
Research on Trust Prediction from a Sociological Perspective,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Jul 2015,2015,"Trust, as a major part of human interactions, plays an important role in helping users collect reliable information and make decisions. However, in reality, user-specified trust relations are often very sparse and follow a power law distribution; hence inferring unknown trust relations attracts increasing attention in recent years. Social theories are frameworks of empirical evidence used to study and interpret social phenomena from a sociological perspective, while social networks reflect the correlations of users in real world; hence, making the principle, rules, ideas and methods of social theories into the analysis of social networks brings new opportunities for trust prediction. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit homophily and social status in trust prediction by modeling social theories. We first give several methods to compute homophily coefficient and status coefficient, then provide a principled way to model trust prediction mathematically, and propose a novel framework, hsTrust, which incorporates homophily theory and status theory. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to understand the importance of homophily theory and status theory in trust prediction.",
"Capuchin monkeys with similar personalities have higher-quality relationships independent of age, sex, kinship and rank",ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,Jul 2015,2015,"Social relationships vary in content, quality and patterning. Most researchers focus on whether and how nondispositional factors, including age, sex, kinship and rank, predict variance in the content, quality and patterning of relationships. However, within a species, these factors do not always predict partner choice. We examined whether similarity in any of five personality traits, Assertiveness, Openness, Neuroticism, Sociability and Attentiveness, independently contributed to variation in the affiliative and agonistic relationships of pairs of brown capuchin monkeys, Sapajus sp. Capuchins that were more similar in Neuroticism had higher affiliative relationship scores, while capuchins that were more similar in Sociability shared overall higher-quality relationships (i.e. the difference between the dyad's affiliative and agonistic scores). These effects were independent of age, sex, kinship and rank, suggesting that certain aspects of the psychology of these animals may contribute uniquely to the quality of their social relationships.

"Studying the coevolution of social distance, offline- and online contacts",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jul 2015,2015,"We inquire about the correlations between contact and perceived social distance: Whether in line with the contact theory, online as well as offline contacts that Israeli Jews have with Arabs affect their perceived social distances from Arabs, or rather whether Israeli Jews who feel closer to Arabs maintain more offline and online contacts with Arabs, according to the social homophily approach.We found that social distance, online contact and offline contact were mutually supportive, whereas the background variables included in the regression analysis (age, gender, religiosity, place of residence, education and income) had no effect on either of them. While the three are mutually supportive, perceived social distance and offline contacts had greater explanatory value than online contacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Comparison of bioactive chemical space networks generated using substructure- and fingerprint-based measures of molecular similarity,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN,Jul 2015,2015,"Chemical space networks (CSNs) have recently been introduced as a conceptual alternative to coordinate-based representations of chemical space. CSNs were initially designed as threshold networks using the Tanimoto coefficient as a continuous similarity measure. The analysis of CSNs generated from sets of bioactive compounds revealed that many statistical properties were strongly dependent on their edge density. While it was difficult to compare CSNs at pre-defined similarity threshold values, CSNs with constant edge density were directly comparable. In the current study, alternative CSN representations were constructed by applying the matched molecular pair (MMP) formalism as a substructure-based similarity criterion. For more than 150 compound activity classes, MMP-based CSNs (MMP-CSNs) were compared to corresponding threshold CSNs (THR-CSNs) at a constant edge density by applying different parameters from network science, measures of community structure distributions, and indicators of structure-activity relationship (SAR) information content. MMP-CSNs were found to be an attractive alternative to THR-CSNs, yielding low edge densities and well-resolved topologies. MMP-CSNs and corresponding THR-CSNs often had similar topology and closely corresponding community structures, although there was only limited overlap in similarity relationships. The homophily principle from network science was shown to affect MMP-CSNs and THR-CSNs in different ways, despite the presence of conserved topological features. Moreover, activity cliff distributions in alternative CSN designs markedly differed, which has important implications for SAR analysis.",
Explaining Coordination in Collaborative Partnerships and Clarifying the Scope of the Belief Homophily Hypothesis,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY,Jul 2015,2015,"The move towards collaborative governance in environmental policy often takes the form of collaborative partnerships involving multiple stakeholders with divergent beliefs and interests. Within such partnerships, stakeholders selectively coordinate with one another to varying degrees to achieve both individual and shared objectives. Using interview and questionnaire data from 10 US marine aquaculture partnerships in 2009-2011, we test three theoretical hypotheses regarding how individuals within collaborative partnerships decide with whom to coordinate. These competing propositions include belief homophily (individuals will coordinate with whom they share beliefs), trust (individuals will coordinate with those whom they trust), and resources (individuals will coordinate with those who hold critical resources). Results suggest that specific aspects of trust and resources are more important than shared beliefs in driving coordination in marine aquaculture partnerships. This finding qualifies previous studies that identified shared beliefs as a driving factor. This study concludes with a theoretical discussion about the explanatory boundaries of belief homophily.",
How individual characteristics shape the structure of social networks,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,Jul 2015,2015,"We study how students' social networks emerge by documenting systematic patterns in the process of friendship formation of incoming students; these students all start out in a new environment and thus jointly create a new social network. As a specific novelty, we consider cooperativeness, time and risk preferences - elicited experimentally - together with factors like socioeconomic and personality characteristics. We find a number of robust predictors of link formation and of the position within the social network (local and global network centrality). In particular, cooperativeness has a complex association with link formation. We also find evidence for homophily along several dimensions. Finally, our results show that despite these systematic patterns, social network structures can be exogenously manipulated, as we find that random assignments of students to groups on the first two days of university impacts the students' friendship formation process.

Collaborating with People Like Me: Ethnic Coauthorship within the United States,JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS,Jul 2015,2015,"By examining the ethnic identity of authors in over 2.5 million scientific papers written by US-based authors from 1985 to 2008, we find that persons of similar ethnicity coauthor together more frequently than predicted by their proportion among authors. The greater homophily is associated with publication in lower-impact journals and with fewer citations. Meanwhile, papers with authors in more locations and with longer reference lists get published in higher-impact journals and receive more citations. These findings suggest that diversity in inputs by author ethnicity, location, and references leads to greater contributions to science as measured by impact factors and citations.",
Minding the Gender Gap: Social Network and Internet Correlates of Business Performance Among Chinese Immigrant Entrepreneurs,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,Jul 2015,2015,"Existing studies have been inconclusive on whether and the extent to which gendered social networks contribute to the gender gap in business performance. Drawing on a random sample of Chinese Canadian entrepreneurs, this research examines the nexus of social networks, Internet use, and the gender gap in business performance. Results reveal a marked gender difference in firm size, which becomes narrowed after social networks, voluntary association participation, Internet use, and business characteristics are controlled. More important, network composition and structural position have different implications for men and women entrepreneurs. Men are more effective in converting relational advantages into business advantages. Interaction effects suggest that kin homophily hurts women's business performance but not men's. Yet, women gain more from participating in transnational entrepreneurship.",
The Effects of Candidate's Ethnic Source Cue and Party Affiliation on Hispanic Voters' Homophily Perceptions and Voting Intent,JOURNAL OF CREATIVE COMMUNICATIONS,Jul 2015,2015,"Because of the rapid demographic shifts in the United States (US), it is vital to examine how voters of different ethnic backgrounds perceive the ethnic source cue of a candidate in political advertising and how such perceptions influence voting behaviour. We used a post-test-only experiment to investigate the effects of candidate's ethnic source cue and party affiliation on voters' homophily perceptions and voting intent. A total of 335 college students from a large southwestern university in the US were recruited to take part in a post-test-only experiment. Results from multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) found that candidate's ethnic source cue and party affiliation have significant main effects on voters' homophily perceptions and voting intent. The moderating effects of voters' own ethnicity, party identification and gender were also found to have statistically significant effects on voters' homophily perceptions and voting intent. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",
An enhanced trust propagation approach with expertise and homophily-based trust networks,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,Jul 2015,2015,"The transitivity property of trust enables the propagation of a trust value through a chain of trusting users in social networks and then provides an expected trust value for another user. Logically, a user in social networks can assess a large number of other users, even if two users have not been directly connected previously. However, a large percentage of trust propagation efforts fail to find reliable trust paths from a source user to a target user because the web of trust in real-world online social networks is too sparse. The success (both quality and quantity) of a trust propagation algorithm strongly relies on the density of a web of trust. The more trust paths that are able to reach the given target user, the more reliable will be the trust estimates based on the trust path with the highest strength. In this paper, we propose an enriched trust propagation approach by combining a homophily-based trust network with an expertise-based trust network, which enhances the density of the trust network. We then evaluate the prediction accuracy and coverage of trust propagation based on various aggregation methods and highlight the most promising method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Ethnic segregation of friendship networks in school: Testing a rational-choice argument of differences in ethnic homophily between classroom- and grade-level networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2015,2015,"Adolescents' school-based friendship networks tend to be segregated along ethnic lines. But few studies have examined whether variation in network boundaries affects the degree of ethnic friendship segregation. We use rational-choice theory to argue that ethnic homophily is more pronounced for friendships between classrooms than for those within classrooms. We empirically test this hypothesis using two-wave German panel data (N=1258) and stochastic actor-oriented models (RSiena). In line with our theoretical argument, we find that the tendency to form same-ethnic friendships is indeed stronger at the grade level, which translates into stronger ethnic segregation in friendship networks at the grade level than at the classroom level. Implications for research on ethnic segregation in school-based friendship networks are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Intervention Strategies and the Diffusion of Collective Behavior,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Jun 30 2015,2015,"This paper examines the intervention strategies for the diffusion of collective behavior, such as promoting innovation adoption and repressing a strike. An intervention strategy refers to controlling the behaviors of a small number of individuals in terms of their social or personal attributes, including connectivity (i.e., the number of social ties one holds), motivation (i.e., an individual's intrinsic cost-benefit judgment on behavior change), and sensitivity (i.e., the degree to which one follows others). Extensive agent-based simulations demonstrate that the optimal strategy fundamentally depends on the goal and time of intervention. Moreover, the nature of the social network (determined by homophily type and level) moderates the effectiveness of a strategy. These results have substantial implications for the design and evaluation of intervention programs.",
"Homophily, Close Friendship, and Life Satisfaction among Gay, Lesbian, Heterosexual, and Bisexual Men and Women",PLOS ONE,Jun 18 2015,2015,"Friends play important roles throughout our lives by providing expressive, instrumental, and companionate support. We examined sexual orientation, gender, and age differences in the number of friends people can rely on for expressive, instrumental, and companionate support. Additionally, we examined the extent to which people relied on same-gender versus cross-gender friends for these types of support. Participants (N = 25,185) completed a survey via a popular news website. Sexual orientation differences in number of same-gender and cross-gender friends were generally small or non-existent, and satisfaction with friends was equally important to overall life satisfaction for all groups. However, the extent to which people's friendship patterns demonstrated gender-based homophily varied by sexual orientation, gender, and age. Young adult gay and bisexual men, and to some extent bisexual women and older bisexual men, did not conform to gendered expectations that people affiliate primarily with their own gender.",
Playing with Strangers: Which Shared Traits Attract Us Most to New People?,PLOS ONE,Jun 8 2015,2015,"Homophily, the tendency for individuals to associate with those who are most similar to them, has been well documented. However, the influence of different kinds of similarity (e.g. relating to age, music taste, ethical views) in initial preferences for a stranger have not been compared. In the current study, we test for a relationship between sharing a variety of traits (i.e. having different kinds of similarity) with a stranger and the perceived likeability of that stranger. In two online experiments, participants were introduced to a series of virtual partners with whom they shared traits, and subsequently carried out activities designed to measure positivity directed towards those partners. Greater numbers of shared traits led to linearly increasing ratings of partner likeability and ratings on the Inclusion of Other in Self scale. We identified several consistent predictors of these two measures: shared taste in music, religion and ethical views. These kinds of trait are likely to be judged as correlates of personality or social group, and may therefore be used as proxies of more in-depth information about a person who might be socially more relevant.",
Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook,SCIENCE,Jun 5 2015,2015,"Exposure to news, opinion, and civic information increasingly occurs through social media. How do these online networks influence exposure to perspectives that cut across ideological lines? Using deidentified data, we examined how 10.1 million U.S. Facebook users interact with socially shared news. We directly measured ideological homophily in friend networks and examined the extent to which heterogeneous friends could potentially expose individuals to cross-cutting content. We then quantified the extent to which individuals encounter comparatively more or less diverse content while interacting via Facebook's algorithmically ranked News Feed and further studied users' choices to click through to ideologically discordant content. Compared with algorithmic ranking, individuals' choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure to cross-cutting content.",
The anatomy of urban social networks and its implications in the searchability problem,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Jun 2 2015,2015,"The appearance of large geolocated communication datasets has recently increased our understanding of how social networks relate to their physical space. However, many recurrently reported properties, such as the spatial clustering of network communities, have not yet been systematically tested at different scales. In this work we analyze the social network structure of over 25 million phone users from three countries at three different scales: country, provinces and cities. We consistently find that this last urban scenario presents significant differences to common knowledge about social networks. First, the emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled by whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost independently of the population or geographic extension of the city. Second, urban communities are much less geographically clustered than expected. These two findings shed new light on the widely-studied searchability in self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of decentralized search strategies we conclude that urban networks are searchable not through geographical proximity as their country-wide counterparts, but through an homophily-driven community structure.",
"Language in Online Dating Texts: Trait Identification, Homophily, and their Effect on Attraction",ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE,SUM 2015,2015,"Research has indicated that online daters may pick up on language cues connected to personality traits in online dating profile texts, and act upon those cues. This research seeks to investigate the level of accuracy of detection of personality in dating profile texts, and the extent to which perceived or actual similarity of personality has an effect on attractiveness of the author. An online survey was conducted collecting the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) for each participant and text author, a peer-report TIPI score by participants for each text author, and an attractiveness rating on a Likert scale for each author. Participants correctly identified Extraversion, though the effect size was small. Contrary to the hypotheses, participants preferred texts when written by an author with a personality they perceived as dissimilar to their own, specifically in Openness and Conscientiousness, and no relationship was found between actual similarity of personality and attractiveness. Online daters may choose partners with complementary or desirable traits rather than similar traits, or other factors in attraction may be more salient in the initial stages of determining attraction.",
Cohesive subgroups in academic networks: unveiling clique integration of top-level female and male researchers,SCIENTOMETRICS,Jun 2015,2015,"Social networks are said to have a positive impact on scientific development. Conventionally, it is argued that female and male researchers differ in access to and participation in networks and hence experience unequal career opportunities. Due to limited capacities of time and resources as well as homophily, top-level scientists may structure their contacts to reduce problems of complexity and uncertainty. The outcomes of the structuring can be cohesive subgroups within networks of relation. Women in science might suffer exclusion from cliques because of being dissimilar in the arena. The present paper aims to explore integration in and composition of scientific cliques. A three-step analysis is conducted: Firstly, cliques are identified. Secondly, overlap structures are examined. Thirdly, group compositions are analysed in terms of other personal attributes of the researchers involved. Building on network data of female and male investigators, the article applies a comparative case study design including two cutting edge research institutions from the German Excellence Initiative. The study contrasts a Cluster of Excellence with a Graduate School and the corresponding formal with the informal networks. The results imply that the general hypothesis of unfavourably embedded female researchers cannot be supported. Although women are less integrated in scientific cliques, the majority is involved in an inner social circle which enables access to career-relevant network resources.",
Venue-Mediated Weak Ties in Multiplex HIV Transmission Risk Networks Among Drug-Using Male Sex Workers and Associates,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Jun 2015,2015,"Objectives. We investigated the structural characteristics of a multiplex HIV transmission risk network of drug-using male sex workers and their associates.Methods. Using a sample of 387 drug-using male sex workers and their male and female associates in Houston, Texas, we estimated an exponential random graph model to examine the venue-mediated relationships between individuals, the structural characteristics of relationships not linked to social venues, and homophily. We collected data in 2003 to 2004. The network comprised social, sexual, and drug-using relationships and affiliations with social venues.Results. Individuals affiliated with the same social venues, bars, or street intersections were more likely to have nonreciprocated (weak) ties with others. Sex workers were less likely than were other associates to have reciprocated (strong) ties to other sex workers with the same venues. Individuals tended to have reciprocated ties not linked to venues. Partner choice tended to be predicated on homophily.Conclusions. Social venues may provide a milieu for forming weak ties in HIV transmission risk networks centered on male sex workers, which may foster the efficient diffusion of prevention messages as diverse information is obtained and information redundancy is avoided.",
"Feasible, Rigorous, and Relevant: Validation of a Measure of Friendship Homophily for Diverse Classrooms",JOURNAL OF EARLY ADOLESCENCE,JUN-AUG 2015,2015,"Peers become increasingly influential in children's development during late childhood and early adolescence. A large body of research has documented children's proclivity for forming friendships with peers who share similar attributes to themselves, a phenomenon termed homophily. Researchers have used multiple procedures to operationalize homophily. However, a measure of homophily that accounts for the diversity of children in classrooms has yet to be validated in elementary and middle school settings. Using social network data collected from a racially diverse sample of 553 elementary and middle school students (53 classrooms; 7 schools), this study aims to validate a measure of friendship homophily that accounts for differential opportunity structures in classroom contexts. Using race and gender as grouping attributes, we find evidence for the reliability, as well as the convergent and predictive validity, of the friendship homophily measure. Implications for researchers and educators are discussed.",
Social Effects in the In-Flight Marketplace: Characterization and Managerial Implications,JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH,Jun 2015,2015,"This article investigates the in-flight marketplace, using detailed data of in-flight purchases to understand social effects in purchase behavior and determine their potential for designing marketing promotions. On average, a passenger is approximately 30% more likely to buy an item after being exposed to a lateral purchase. Analyses on the underlying mechanisms reveal that the classical social influence theories do not suffice to explain all the patterns in the data. The author proposes omission neglect, product contagion, and goal balancing as complementary theories. Finally, consumers' willingness to buy is shown to be positively correlated with responsiveness to social influence. This finding indicates that homophily and social feedback effects-classically viewed in the literature as nuisances-can provide targeting value for the firm. By taking these factors into account during behavior-based targeting, firms can double the social spillovers of marketing actions.",
Exploring the use of social network analysis to measure communication between disease programme and district managers at sub-national level in South Africa,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Jun 2015,2015,"With increasing interest in maximising synergies between disease control programmes (DCP) and general health services (GHS), methods are needed to measure interactions between DCP and GHS actors. In South Africa, administrative integration reforms make GHS managers at decentralised level (district managers) responsible for the oversight of DCP operations within districts, with DCP managers (programme managers) providing specialist support. The reforms necessitate interdependence, but these actors work together ineffectively. Communication is crucial for joint working, but no research to assess communication between these actors has been done. This study explores the use of social network analysis (SNA) to measure the extent to which programme and district managers in South Africa communicate, using HIV monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as an exemplar. Data were collected from fifty one managers in two provinces during 2010-2011, to measure; a) one-on-one task-related communication talking about the collation (verification, reporting) and use of HIV data for monitoring HIV interventions; and b) group communication through co-participating in management committees where HIV data are used for monitoring HIV interventions in districts. SNA measures were computed to describe actor centrality, network density (cohesion), and communication within and between respective manager groups. Block modelling Was applied to identify management committees that connect respective manager groups. Results show HIV programme managers located at higher level communicated largely amongst themselves as a group (homophily), seldom talked to the district managers to whom they are supposed to provide specialist HIV M&E support, and rarely participated with them in management committees. This research demonstrates the utility of SNA as a tool for measuring the extent of communication between DCP and GHS actors at sub-national level. Actions are needed to bridge observed communication gaps in order to promote collaborative monitoring of HIV programme interventions within, districts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Social Contagion and Customer Adoption of New Sales Channels,JOURNAL OF RETAILING,Jun 2015,2015,"We develop and test hypotheses regarding the role of social contagion in customer adoption of new sales channels. We examine two aspects of social contagion (local contagion and homophily) and two channels (Internet and bricks-and-mortar store). Drawing on diffusion theory, we propose a conceptual framework that identifies the factors associated with new channel adoption. Using longitudinal data from a major catalog company and a discrete-time hazard model, we find that (1) social contagion plays a major role in the adoption of new sales channels, (2) both local contagion and homophily influence channel adoption, (3) longer-tenured customers are less influenced by social contagion, and (4) adoption of the Internet channel is more influenced by social contagion than adoption of the bricks-and-mortar store. Managerially, our results suggest that marketing programs that encourage social contagion, for example, word-of-mouth campaigns, be targeted based on both physical and socio-economic proximity, and that such campaigns will play a bigger role in the adoption of new-to-the-world channels.

International Nonprofit Collaboration: Examining the Role of Homophily,NONPROFIT AND VOLUNTARY SECTOR QUARTERLY,Jun 2015,2015,"The importance and popularity of interorganizational collaboration among nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have grown considerably in recent years. Despite these growths, however, not much is known about why NGOs network the way they do or why NGO networks are structured the way they are. Using homophily theory and exponential random graph modeling, this study examines the patterns of interorganizational collaborative ties among infectious diseases international NGOs (INGOs) in 2007 (n = 94). The results suggest that these NGOs are more likely to collaborate when they have the same status, when they have similar (closer) founding dates, when they are headquartered in the same global hemisphere (north/south), when they have common funding partners, and when they are headquartered in the same geographic regions. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that various sources of homophily inform partner selection among infectious disease INGOs.",
Online news diffusion dynamics and public opinion formation: A case study of the controversy over judges' personal opinion expression on SNS in Korea,SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL,Jun 2015,2015,"On the Internet, the line between news and opinion becomes blurred in terms of content and form. In this sense, the processes of news diffusion on the Internet and online public opinion formation are integrated. This study selects one Korean example about the private tweet of a judge about government social network service (SNS) regulation and analyzes citation networks from one news/opinion to another news/opinion. By relying on social network analysis (SNA) methods, this study examines how news/opinions diffuse and how they interact and influence each other's ideological frame within agencies sharing the same ideology and between agencies whose ideologies contrast. The results show that public discourse on the Internet is clearly polarized and fragmented along political ideological lines. Additionally, the findings show that the winner is the conservative bloc because it succeeds in achieving within-bloc solidarity and ensures the resonance of news frames with the cultural values of Korean society. Implications for these findings in modern democracy are also discussed. (C) 2015 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Inequality in Access to Social Capital in the Netherlands,SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION,Jun 2015,2015,"Whereas much research has been done on the benefits of social capital, less is known about the causes of the unequal distribution of social capital in people's networks. This study examines inequalities in access to social capital in terms of the socio-economic resources that are embedded in personal networks. Using data from NELLS, a nationally representative survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 years, results show that within this age group access to social capital increases with age and educational qualifications, and is lower among women. Residing in a less affluent neighbourhood and scoring lower on a measurement for cognitive abilities are associated with less social capital. Participation in voluntary associations and having an ethnically diverse network are associated with more access to social capital. Surprisingly, when studying differences across national origin groups, we do not find that Turkish immigrants are disadvantaged in access to social capital.",
"People Like Me: Shared Belief, False Consensus, and the Experience of Community",QUALITATIVE SOCIOLOGY,Jun 2015,2015,"Contemporary theory on community suggests that disagreement or conflict over foundational beliefs and values greatly decreases the chance that a successful, sustainable community experience will develop. My findings suggest, however, that feelings of community can develop despite incongruous ideologies through the perception of shared beliefs and values. Using an ethnographic case of a voluntary non-profit organization, I demonstrate how three types of mechanisms operate jointly to maintain a community without shared beliefs: environmental mechanisms related to the division of labor, relational mechanisms associated with selective recruitment and homophily, and a cognitive mechanism that produces the feeling of consensus in the absence of objectively shared beliefs. These mechanisms combine to allow a powerful experience of community to flourish in a context where we might expect, based on previous research, no community experience at all. Implications for the study of community, sociology of organizations, and social psychology are discussed.",
Nonreligious Group Factors Versus Religious Belief in the Prediction of Prosociality,SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH,Jun 2015,2015,"Previous research has suggested that religious belief is associated with a range of prosocial behaviors such as social embeddedness and generosity. However, this literature has often conflated belief in God with group involvement and failed to control for demographic and social network effects. Rather than assessing prosociality by comparing religious group members with the unaffiliated, the present study also includes secular/nonreligious group members. Multiple regression analyses controlling for confounds diminishes many of the apparent differences between religious and nonreligious individuals. Belief in God itself accounts for approximately 1-2 % of the variance in social embeddedness domains and < 1 % of the variance in the domains of outside-group charity and community volunteering. Belief in God is associated with homophily and parochial behavior such as within-group charitable donations and constrained contact with different others. These findings indicate that prosocial benefits are more related to general group membership equally available to religious and secular group members alike than they are to specifically religious content. Religious beliefs are related to within-group prosociality as well as homophily and parochialism directed to those outside the group.",
Making Big Communities Small: Using Network Science to Understand the Ecological and Behavioral Requirements for Community Social Capital,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,Jun 2015,2015,"The concept of social capital is becoming increasingly common in community psychology and elsewhere. However, the multiple conceptual and operational definitions of social capital challenge its utility as a theoretical tool. The goals of this paper are to clarify two forms of social capital (bridging and bonding), explicitly link them to the structural characteristics of small world networks, and explore the behavioral and ecological prerequisites of its formation. First, I use the tools of network science and specifically the concept of small-world networks to clarify what patterns of social relationships are likely to facilitate social capital formation. Second, I use an agent-based model to explore how different ecological characteristics (diversity and segregation) and behavioral tendencies (homophily and proximity) impact communities' potential for developing social capital. The results suggest diverse communities have the greatest potential to develop community social capital, and that segregation moderates the effects that the behavioral tendencies of homophily and proximity have on community social capital. The discussion highlights how these findings provide community-based researchers with both a deeper understanding of the contextual constraints with which they must contend, and a useful tool for targeting their efforts in communities with the greatest need or greatest potential.",
"An exploration of the correlates of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism in romantic relationships: Homophily, partner characteristics, and dyadic adjustment",PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES,Jun 2015,2015,"The present study examined the characteristics of individuals (N = 104 undergraduate couples) who date grandiosely or vulnerably narcissistic individuals, including the experience of developmental trauma, general and pathological personality traits, and psychopathology, using multiple data sources. In addition, relationship duration was tested as a moderator of the relations between the narcissism dimensions and relationship adjustment. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models indicated that negative relationship adjustment was found when both partners had higher entitlement/exploitativeness traits and had been together for a longer period of time. Overall, there were no clear patterns of partner characteristics, although some evidence for homophily emerged for traits related to grandiose narcissism. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Practice, problems and power in 'internationalisation at home': critical reflections on recent research evidence",TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION,May 19 2015,2015,"In a period when international flows of higher education students are rapidly increasing and diversifying, this paper reviews recent research evidence about the experiences of 'home' students - those who are not mobile and study in their home nation. This is situated within the concept of 'internationalisation at home', which asserts that these students should also receive an international educational experience: through interaction with international students, curriculum development and new pedagogic approaches. However, the evidence to date suggests that this is considerably more problematic than might be imagined. For example, home students across the world are often found to resist intercultural group work and generally to avoid contact with their international peers, leading to concerns about unequal access to transformative experiences and powerful knowledge. The conflict between 'global worker' and 'global citizen' approaches to internationalisation is discussed, as well as the increasingly hegemonic role of English.",
Political homophily on social network sites and users' poll skepticism,ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,May 4 2015,2015,,
"Religion, Race, and Discrimination: A Field Experiment of How American Churches Welcome Newcomers",JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,May 2015,2015,"This article reports the results of a nationwide audit study testing how Christian churches welcome potential newcomers to their churches as a function of newcomers' race and ethnicity. We sent email inquiries to 3,120 churches across the United States. The emails were ostensibly from someone moving to the area and looking for a new church to attend. That person's name was randomly varied to convey different racial and ethnic associations. In response to these inquiries, representatives from mainline Protestant churcheswho generally embrace liberal, egalitarian attitudes toward race relationsactually demonstrated the most discriminatory behavior. They responded most frequently to emails with white-sounding names, somewhat less frequently to black- or Hispanic-sounding names, and much less to Asian-sounding names. They also sent shorter, less welcoming responses to nonwhite names. In contrast, evangelical Protestant and Catholic churches showed little variation across treatment groups in their responses. These findings underscore the role of homophily, organizational homogeneity, and the costs of racial integration in perpetuating the racial segregation of American religious life.",
INTERVENTIONS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS: IMPACT ON MOOD AND NETWORK DYNAMICS,ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS,MAY-JUN 2015,2015,"Results from two studies on longitudinal friendship networks are presented, exploring the impact of a gratitude intervention on positive and negative affect dynamics in a social network. The gratitude intervention had been previously shown to increase positive affect and decrease negative affect in an individual but dynamic group effects have not been considered. In the first study, the intervention was administered to the whole network. In the second study, two social networks are considered and in each only a subset of individuals, initially low/high in negative affect respectively received the intervention as ""agents of change"". Data was analyzed using stochastic actor-based modeling techniques to identify resulting network changes, impact on positive and negative affect and potential contagion of mood within the group. The first study found a group level increase in positive and a decrease in negative affect. Homophily was detected with regard to positive and negative affect but no evidence of contagion was found. The network itself became more volatile along with a fall in rate of change of negative affect. Centrality measures indicated that the best broadcasters were the individuals with the least negative affect levels at the beginning of the study. In the second study, the positive and negative affect levels for the whole group depended on the initial levels of negative affect of the intervention recipients. There was evidence of positive affect contagion in the group where intervention recipients had low initial level of negative affect and contagion in negative affect for the group where recipients had initially high level of negative affect.",
Problem-solving effort and success in innovation contests: The role of national wealth and national culture,JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT,May 2015,2015,"Innovation contests allow firms to harness specialized skills and services from globally dispersed participants for solutions to business problems. Such contests provide a rich setting for operations management (OM) scholars to explore problem solving in global labor markets as firms continue to unbundle their innovation value chains. In this study, we examine the implications of specific types of diversity in innovation contests on problem-solving effort and success. First, we conceptualize diversity among contestants in terms of national wealth (measured as gross domestic product per capita (GDPP) adjusted for purchasing power parity) and national culture (measured using the culture dimensions of performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance) and examine how such factors influence problem-solving effort. Next, we examine how differences between contestants and contest holders in terms of the above factors influence contest outcomes. Using data from a popular online innovation contest platform and country-level archival data, we find that contestants from countries with lower levels of GDPP are more likely to exert greater problem-solving effort compared to other contestants. With regard to national culture, we find that performance orientation and uncertainty avoidance have positive and negative effects, respectively, each of which weakens with increasing levels of GDPP. Finally, our analysis provides evidence of homophily effects indicating that contestants who share greater similarities with the contest holder in terms of national wealth and national culture are more likely to be successful in a contest. We discuss the implications of the study's findings for contest holders and platform owners who organize innovation contests, and for emerging research on innovation contests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Network analysis reveals open forums and echo chambers in social media discussions of climate change,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,May 2015,2015,"Action to tackle the complex and divisive issue of climate change will be strongly influenced by public perception. Online social media and associated social networks are an increasingly important forum for public debate and are known to influence individual attitudes and behaviours - yet online discussions and social networks related to climate change are not well understood. Here we construct several forms of social network for users communicating about climate change on the popular microblogging platform Twitter. We classify user attitudes to climate change based on message content and find that social networks are characterised by strong attitude-based homophily and segregation into polarised ""sceptic"" and ""activist"" groups. Most users interact only with like-minded others, in communities dominated by a single view. However, we also find mixed-attitude communities in which sceptics and activists frequently interact. Messages between like-minded users typically carry positive sentiment, while messages between sceptics and activists carry negative sentiment. We identify a number of general patterns in user behaviours relating to engagement with alternative views. Users who express negative sentiment are themselves the target of negativity. Users in mixed-attitude communities are less likely to hold a strongly polarised view, but more likely to express negative sentiment towards other users with differing views. Overall, social media discussions of climate change often occur within polarising ""echo chambers"", but also within ""open forums"", mixed-attitude communities that reduce polarisation and stimulate debate. Our results have implications for public engagement with this important global challenge. (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",
Phenotypic assortment in wild primate networks: implications for the dissemination of information,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,May 2015,2015,"Individuals' access to social information can depend on their social network. Homophily-a preference to associate with similar phenotypes-may cause assortment within social networks that could preclude information transfer from individuals who generate information to those who would benefit from acquiring it. Thus, understanding phenotypic assortment may lead to a greater understanding of the factors that could limit the transfer of information between individuals. We tested whether there was assortment in wild baboon (Papio ursinus) networks, using data collected from two troops over 6 years for six phenotypic traits-boldness, age, dominance rank, sex and the propensity to generate/exploit information-using two methods for defining a connection between individuals-time spent in proximity and grooming. Our analysis indicated that assortment was more common in grooming than proximity networks. In general, there was homophily for boldness, age, rank and the propensity to both generate and exploit information, but heterophily for sex. However, there was considerable variability both between troops and years. The patterns of homophily we observed for these phenotypes may impede information transfer between them. However, the inconsistency in the strength of assortment between troops and years suggests that the limitations to information flow may be quite variable.",
Information networks that generate economic value: A study on clusters of adopters of new or improved technologies and practices among oil palm growers in Mexico,AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS,May 2015,2015,"The area under cultivation of oil palm has undergone considerable growth in Mexico, but yields are far below their potential. This is related to the low rate of adoption of new or improved technologies and practices in areas such as plantation management and farm administration. This study determines the factors that have an influence on adoption of new or improved technologies and practices and their relationship with the generation of economic value of oil palm. A cluster analysis of 33 key new or improved technologies and practices adopted by 104 growers was performed, and the main adoption categories and the variables influencing adoption are described. The results indicate that three clusters of growers can be discerned that differ in terms of their levels of adoption. The highest level of adoption of new or improved technologies and practices is related to higher yields and vice versa. The new or improved technologies and practices that differentiate the cluster of the advanced adopters from the cluster of the basic adopters are those related to plantation health, grower associations and production unit management. The cluster of the intermediate adopters is outstanding for their levels of adoption of new or improved technologies and practices in the aspects of plant nutrition, harvest, and genetics and reproduction. The advanced adopters set up better links for getting information, generally from their extensionists. The three clusters each exhibit a great degree of homophily, indicating little information flow between the different clusters of growers, while these can learn from each other. These results make it evident that better articulation among different clusters of growers and other actors should be encouraged, and that diversified and tailor-made extension strategies should be designed to optimally support different clusters of growers.

Exploring the Social Integration of Sexual Minority Youth Across HighSchool Contexts,CHILD DEVELOPMENT,MAY-JUN 2015,2015,"Mental health disparities between sexual minority and other youth have been theorized to result in part from the effects of the stigmatization on social integration. Stochastic actor-based modeling was applied to complete network data from two high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (M-age=15years, N=2,533). Same-sex attracted youth were socially marginalized in a smaller predominantly White school but not in a larger, more racially diverse school. For both schools, homophily was a critical network feature, and could represent social support for and social segregation of such youth. These findings emphasize the school context in studying the social lives of sexual minority youth and suggest that youth may be better off socially in larger and more diverse schools.",
RACIALLY HOMOPHILOUS SOCIAL TIES AND INFORMAL SOCIAL CONTROL,CRIMINOLOGY,May 2015,2015,"Social disorganization theory argues that racial/ethnic heterogeneity is a key neighborhood characteristic leading to social disorganization and, consequently, higher levels of crime. Heterogeneity's effect is argued to be a result of its fragmentation of social ties along racial/ethnic lines, which creates racially homophilous social networks with few ties bridging racial/ethnic groups. Most studies of social ties in social disorganization models, however, have examined their quantity and left unaddressed the extent to which ties are within or across different racial groups. This study goes beyond previous studies by examining the effects of both racially homophilous and interracial friendship networks on informal social control. Using multilevel models and data from 66 neighborhoods with approximately 2,300 respondents, we found that heterogeneity actually increased the average percentage of residents with interracial friendship networks, but the percentage of residents with interracial networks decreased the likelihood of informal social control. In contrast, the percentage of residents with White racially homophilous networks increased the likelihood of informal social control. Examining the microcontext of individuals' networks, however, we found residents with interracial ties reported higher likelihoods of informal social control and that this effect was enhanced in neighborhoods with higher percentages of non-White racially homophilous networks.",
"Popularity, Similarity, and the Network Extraversion Bias",PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,May 2015,2015,"Using the emergent friendship network of an incoming cohort of students in an M.B.A. program, we examined the role of extraversion in shaping social networks. Extraversion has two important implications for the emergence of network ties: a popularity effect, in which extraverts accumulate more friends than introverts do, and a homophily effect, in which the more similar are two people's levels of extraversion, the more likely they are to become friends. These effects result in a systematic network extraversion bias, in which people's social networks will tend to be overpopulated with extraverts and underpopulated with introverts. Moreover, the most extraverted people have the greatest network extraversion bias, and the most introverted people have the least network extraversion bias. Our finding that social networks were systematically misrepresentative of the broader social environment raises questions about whether there is a societal bias toward believing other people are more extraverted than they actually are and whether introverts are better socially calibrated than extraverts.",
Heterogeneity and the formation of risk-sharing coalitions,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,May 2015,2015,"We study the relationship between the distribution of individuals' attributes over the population and the extent of risk sharing in a risky environment. We consider a society where individuals voluntarily form risk-sharing groups in the absence of financial markets. We obtain a partition of society into distinct coalitions leading to partial risk sharing. When individuals differ only with respect to risk, the partition is homophily-based: the less risky agents congregate together and reject more risky ones into other coalitions. The distribution of risk affects the number and size of these coalitions. It turns out that individuals may pay a lower risk premium in more risky societies. We show that a higher heterogeneity in risk leads to a lower degree of partial risk sharing. The case of heterogenous risk aversion generates similar results. The empirical evidence on partial risk sharing can be understood when the endogenous partition of society into risk-sharing coalitions is taken into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Heuristics, Interactions, and Status Hierarchies: An Agent-based Model of Deference Exchange",SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH,May 2015,2015,"Since Merton's classical analysis of cumulative advantage in science, it has been observed that status hierarchies display a sizable disconnect between actors' quality and rank and that they become increasingly asymmetric over time, without, however, turning into winner-take-all structures. In recent years, formal models of status hierarchies tried to account for these facts by combining two micro-level, counterbalancing mechanisms: social influence (supposedly driving inequality) and the desire for reciprocation in deferential gestures (supposedly limiting inequality). In the article, we adopt as empirical benchmark basic features that are common to most distributions of status indicators (e.g., income, academic prestige, wealth, social ties) and argue that previous formal models were only partially able to reproduce such macro-level patterns. We then introduce a novel agent-based computational model of deferential gestures that improves on the realism of previous models by introducing heuristic-based decision making, actors' heterogeneity, and status homophily in social interactions. We systematically and extensively study the model's parameter space and consider a few variants to determine under which conditions the macroscopic patterns of interest are more likely to appear. We find that specific forms of status-based heterogeneity in actors' propensity to interact with status-dissimilar others are needed to generate status hierarchies that best approximate these macroscopic features.",
The Effects of Diversity and Network Ties on Innovations: The Emergence of a New Scientific Field,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,May 2015,2015,"This study examines the influence of different types of diversity, both observable and unobservable, on the creation of innovative ideas. Our framework draws on theory and research on information processing, social categorization, coordination, and homophily to posit the influence of cognitive, gender, and country diversity on innovation. Our longitudinal model is based on a unique data set of 1,354 researchers who helped create the new scientific field of oncofertility, by collaborating on 469 publications over a 4-year period. We capture the differences among researchers along cognitive, country, and gender dimensions, as well as examine how the resulting diversity or homophily influences the formation of collaborative innovation networks. We find that innovation, operationalized as publishing in a new scientific discipline, benefits from both homophily and diversity. Homophily in country of residence and working with prior collaborators help reduce uncertainty in the interactions associated with innovation, while diversity in knowledge enables the recombinant knowledge required for innovation.",
"Online Fragmentation in Wartime: A Longitudinal Analysis of Tweets about Syria, 2011-2013",ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,May 2015,2015,"Theorists have long predicted that like-minded individuals will tend to use social media to self-segregate into enclaves and that this tendency toward homophily will increase over time. Many studies have found moment-in-time evidence of network homophily, but very few have been able to directly measure longitudinal changes in the diversity of social media users' habits. This is due in part to a lack of appropriate tools and methods for such investigations. This study takes a step toward developing those methods. Drawing on the complete historical record of public retweets posted between January 2011 and August 2013, we propose and justify a partial method of measuring increases or decreases in network homophily. We demonstrate that Twitter network communities that focused on Syria are in general highly fragmented and homophilous; however, only one of the nine detected network communities that persisted over time exhibited a clear increase in homophily.",
Individual Motivations and Network Effects: A Multilevel Analysis of the Structure of Online Social Relationships,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,May 2015,2015,"This article explores the relative influence of individual and network-level effects on the emergence of online social relationships. Using network modeling and data drawn from logs of social behavior inside the virtual world Second Life, we combine individual- and network-level theories into an integrated model of online social relationship formation. Results reveal that time spent online and the network pressure toward balance (individuals tending to form relationships with others who have relationships in common) predict the emergence of online relationship ties, while gender, age, proximity, homophily (the tendency of individuals to form relationships among people with similar traits), and preferential attachment are not significant predictors within the observed networks. We discuss these results in light of existing research on online social relationships and describe how digital data and network analytics enable novel insights about the emergence of online social relationships.",
Board interlocking network and the design of executive compensation packages,SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2015,2015,"The standard approach used to model interlocks in the business and management literature is to treat each interlock of a network as an independent data point. However, such an approach ignores the complex inter-dependencies among the common director interlocks. We propose that an interlocking board network is an important inter-corporate setting that has bearing on how company boards make corporate decisions. Using a sample of 725 large U.S.-based public companies over the period 2007-2010, board member information, executive compensation information, and exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) techniques for social networks, we present evidence that board interlocks are positively linked with similarities in the design of executive compensation packages in interlocked firms, particularly the proportions of the options component. We also find evidence that board interlocks are positively linked with similarities in a number of board characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

"Similarity in sex and reproductive state, but not relatedness, influence the strength of association in the social network of feral horses in the Blauwe Kamer Nature Reserve",ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,Apr 3 2015,2015,"Relatedness is likely to affect the decisions of animals regarding their affiliations with conspecifics. Social network analysis provides tools to describe the social structure of animals. Here, we investigate the social network of a population of 27 unmanaged Konik horses in the Blauwe Kamer Nature Reserve, in the Netherlands. We test three hypotheses: (1) that related individuals will have stronger associations; (2) that individuals with low values of average relatedness to their neighbors in the network will have more links and (3) homophily, the tendency of individuals to associate with similar others, will lead to stronger associations among individuals of similar sex, reproductive state, age and rank in the social network. We videotaped 22 horses (excluding foals) and their interactions. Relatedness was calculated from the pedigree, which was based on parentage, determined by DNA analysis. The social network was based on spatial proximity data. There was no significant influence of relatedness on strength of associations in the network or an influence of age- or rank-homophily. We argue that the lack of a relatedness effect is not likely to have been caused by an inability to detect kinship. Strength of associations in the social network was significantly affected by the tendency of the horses to associate with individuals of the same sex and the same reproductive state. This social network pattern is not common in mammals, and the study of unexplained variation in choice and strength of associations may have important implications for other equids increasingly confined to reserves worldwide.",
"New Perspectives on the ""Silo Effect"": Initial Comparisons of Network Structures Across Public Health Collaboratives",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Apr 2015,2015,"Objectives. We explored to what extent ""silos"" (preferential partnering) persist in interorganizational boundaries despite advances in working across boundaries. We focused on organizational homophily and resulting silo effects within networks that might both facilitate and impede success in public health collaboratives (PHCs).Methods. We analyzed data from 162 PHCs with a series of exponential random graph models to determine the influence of uniform and differential homophily among organizations and to identify the propensity for partnerships with similar organizations.Results. The results demonstrated a low presence (8%) of uniform homophily among networks, whereas a greater number (30%) of PHCs contained varying levels of differential homophily by 1 or more types of organization. We noted that the higher frequency among law enforcement, nonprofits, and public health organizations demonstrated a partner preference with similar organizations.Conclusions. Although we identified only a modest occurrence of partner preference in PHCs, overall success in efforts to work across boundaries might be problematic when public health members (often leaders of PHCs) exhibit the tendency to form silos.",
Unbiased Characterization of Node Pairs over Large Graphs,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA,Apr 2015,2015,"Characterizing user pair relationships is important for applications such as friend recommendation and interest targeting in online social networks (OSNs). Due to the large-scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and thus sampling is used. In this article, we show that it is a great challenge for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships, even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, particularly for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints like existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, as an unbiased sampling technique like UVS is usually not allowed and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to three OSNs-Foursquare, Douban, and Xiami-and discover that significant homophily is present in these networks.",
RACE AND RAPPORT: HOMOPHILY AND RACIAL DISADVANTAGE IN LARGE LAW FIRMS,FORDHAM LAW REVIEW,Apr 2015,2015,,
Social networks and their implications for community living for people with a learning disability,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,Apr 2015,2015,"The human social world is complex and multi-layered, and requires specialised skills to allow us to handle it successfully. This places limits on the size of network that individuals can manage, with a typical network size of around 150 individuals. Kinship plays a crucial role in these networks, with about half of the typical network being family members. By comparison with family relationships, friendships are fragile and deteriorate rapidly when contact rates fall below the rather specific frequencies needed to maintain them. Friendships exhibit strong homophily effects, with the quality of friendships being determined by the number of shared traits. The willingness of both family and friends to act altruistically towards others depends on their shared interests, but there is always a 'kinship premium' (kin are always more generous towards family members). I explore the implications of these structural aspects of natural human social networks for people with a learning disability.",
"Assortative mixing, preferential attachment, and triadic closure: A longitudinal study of tie-generative mechanisms in journal citation networks",JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS,Apr 2015,2015,"This study reveals the roles of three tie-generative mechanisms, namely, assortative mixing, preferential attachment, and triadic closure, in forming citation links in journals through the exponential random graph modeling approach. The study also adopts a longitudinal design to examine how the roles of the three mechanisms evolve over time. The data involve citation exchanges in Internet research among 680 journals in 12 subject areas from 2000 to 2013. Assortative mixing by discipline and publication foci is a significant tie-generative mechanism in journal citation networks. The magnitude of as sortative mixing by discipline remains stable over time, whereas that by publication foci declines over time. Journals in Internet research demonstrate an increasing preference for influential journals to form citation links over time. The indegree of journals does not exert a significant impact on citation link formation among journals, whereas the outdegree of journals imposes a significantly negative impact on citation link formation among journals. Triadic closure is an important force that facilitates the formation of citation links among journals. The findings of this study improve our knowledge of the organizing principles that underlie journal citation networks and advance our understanding of the production process of scientific knowledge in Internet research.

Spanning Cultural and Geographic Barriers with Knowledge Pipelines in Multinational Communities of Practice,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,Apr 2015,2015,"Multinational construction and engineering companies are increasingly adopting communities of practice (COPs), as a means to encourage geographically dispersed and culturally diverse professionals to share knowledge on a global basis. If successful, these COPs form rich, knowledge sharing networks; they mobilize a company's global knowledge base, allowing expertise to be applied when and where it is needed with relatively little managerial oversight. Conversely, geographic and cultural silos within COPs may form due to homophily, the social tendency of individuals to connect with similar others. These silos limit knowledge flows and curb the strategic advantage of a global workforce. Through empirical analysis of social network questionnaires and semistructured interviews, the research reported in this paper analyzed network patterns within three COPs to determine if geographic and cultural silos exist, identify structural patterns that defy homophilous trends, and explore why these network-level patterns exist. The research reported in this paper found that, in the absence of intentional organizational structuring and strategic control, silos induced by homophilious behavior were standard for global communities of practice. To encourage knowledge exchange across geographic and cultural boundaries, managers can create mutual task requirements, provide opportunities for connection through integrated training and learning experiences, and encourage workforce mobility among different geographic and cultural locations.

Trust of the Same: Rethinking Trust and Reputation Management from a Structural Homophily Perspective,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY,APR-JUN 2015,2015,"Trust and reputation management represents a significant trend in tackling the emerging security problems in computer networks. The basic idea is to let machines rate each other and then use the aggregated ratings to derive trust scores. Homophily i.e., love of the same, is the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others mentioned in the social network, and the authors have discovered its presence, in term of nodes' attributes, in studying trust and reputation behaviors for the P2P oriented next generation of WSN. The simulation studies have confirmed the structural homophily, i.e., the similar way of connecting other nodes, is fostering trust characteristics and connections among peers.",
RELIGIOUS HOMOPHILY IN A SECULAR COUNTRY: EVIDENCE FROM A VOTING GAME IN FRANCE,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,Apr 2015,2015,"Homophilythe tendency individuals have to associate with similar-othersis a powerful determinant of social networks. Yet research to date does not allow us to determine which dimension, e.g., ethnic, religious, gender, age, or class similarity, drives association. Tests demonstrating homophily are flawed by restricting the range of dimensions in the choice set. We introduce an experimental game in which we exogenously expose subjects to diverse partners to determine which dimension dominates. We find that in a socio-demographically diverse district of Paris, despite expectations of secularization, religious similarity significantly predicts homophily. Moreover, we provide tentative evidence that religious homophily is taste-based. (JEL C91, D03, D72, J71, Z12)",
Inferring Social Status and Rich Club Effects in Enterprise Communication Networks,PLOS ONE,Mar 30 2015,2015,"Social status, defined as the relative rank or position that an individual holds in a social hierarchy, is known to be among the most important motivating forces in social behaviors. In this paper, we consider the notion of status from the perspective of a position or title held by a person in an enterprise. We study the intersection of social status and social networks in an enterprise. We study whether enterprise communication logs can help reveal how social interactions and individual status manifest themselves in social networks. To that end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication channels-voice call, short message, and email-to demonstrate the social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status. We have several interesting findings and based on these findings we also develop a model to predict social status. On the individual level, high-status individuals are more likely to be spanned as structural holes by linking to people in parts of the enterprise networks that are otherwise not well connected to one another. On the community level, the principle of homophily, social balance and clique theory generally indicate a ""rich club"" maintained by high-status individuals, in the sense that this community is much more connected, balanced and dense. Our model can predict social status of individuals with 93% accuracy.",
Unfolding similarity in interphysician networks: the impact of institutional and professional homophily,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,Mar 10 2015,2015,"Background: Modern healthcare is characterized by high complexity due to the proliferation of specialties, professional roles, and priorities within organizations. To perform clinical interventions, knowledge distributed across units, directorates and individuals needs to be integrated. Formal and/or informal mechanisms may be used to coordinate knowledge and tasks within organizations. Although the literature has recently considered the role of physicians' professional networks in the diffusion of knowledge, several concerns remain about the mechanisms through which these networks emerge within healthcare organizations. The aim of the present paper is to explore the impact of institutional and professional homophilies on the formation of interphysician professional networks.Methods: We collected data on a community of around 300 physicians working at a local health authority within the Italian National Health Service. We employed multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures to explore the extent to which institutional and professional homophilies influence the formation of interphysician networks.Results: We found that both institutional and professional homophilies matter in explaining interphysician networks. Physicians who had similar fields of interest or belonged to the same organizational structure were more likely to establish professional relationships. In addition, professional homophily was more relevant than institutional affiliation in explaining collaborative ties.Conclusions: Our findings have organizational implications and provide useful information for managers who are responsible for undertaking organizational restructuring. Healthcare executives and administrators may want to consider the structure of advice networks while adopting new organizational structures.",
Personalizing Information Using Users' Online Social Networks: A Case Study of CiteULike,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS,Mar 2015,2015,"This paper aims to assess the feasibility of a new and less-focused type of online sociability (the watching network) as a useful information source for personalized recommendations. In this paper, we recommend scientific articles of interests by using the shared interests between target users and their watching connections. Our recommendations are based on one typical social bookmarking system, CiteULike. The watching network-based recommendations, which use a much smaller size of user data, produces suggestions that are as good as the conventional Collaborative Filtering technique. The results demonstrate that the watching network is a useful information source and a feasible foundation for information personalization. Furthermore, the watching network is substitutable for anonymous peers of the Collaborative Filtering recommendations. This study shows the expandability of social network-based recommendations to the new type of online social networks.",
Retention in Online Blogging: A Case Study of the Blogster Community,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS,Mar 2015,2015,"Community-based blogging platforms can be rich sources of information on a variety of specialized topics, from finance to parenting. The usefulness of such platforms depends heavily on user participation and contribution. However, one potential problem is lower retention: users' fail to contribute in the long run. This paper is an investigation of retention in the popular community blogging platform ""Blogster."" We use the points users earn for their activities as a proxy of retention and explore the attributes that are associated with their retention. We find that highly retained users are most central in the network and their blogger friends are mutually less connected. They get more views and comments to their posted blogs. We also examine the homophily of retention in the social network. Based on our empirical observations, we build a classifier that is able to detect top retained users with accuracy as high as 94%. Our work has theoretical implications for the social behavior literature of community bloggers and practical design implications for potential community blogging platform developers.",
COMMUNITIES OF FOLLOWERS IN TOURISM TWITTER ACCOUNTS OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TOURISM HOSPITALITY AND RECREATION,Mar 2015,2015,"Microblogs have been widely adopted by travelers to search, organize, share, and annotate their travel stories and experiences, and by Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) to promote countries' image. Twitter is the most popular microblogging site and one of the top-10 most visited websites on the Internet. Building relationships, convenience of networking, and expanding online branding opportunities have been recorded as the perceived benefits of using Twitter. The paper records tourism Twitter accounts of 37 European countries. It also records indexes of Twitter performance and influence and indexes of followers' community involvement. Next, the mentions/replies (m/r) network of the followers for each account is constructed in order to study whether it demonstrates community characteristics. Clustering coefficient, assortativity, and degree skewness are used as network indexes to explore whether m/r networks present the properties of small-worlds and scale-free networks, and are characterized by homophily. These indexes are then associated with Twitter performance indexes to explore how m/r networks differentiate across accounts of different popularity and performance. Findings reveal that m/r networks of followers do not constitute communities, but rather the people use tourism organizations' Twitter accounts as announcement boards or as one more channel for one-way communication with the public.",
The Social Origins of Networks and Diffusion,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Mar 2015,2015,"Recent research on social contagion has demonstrated significant effects of network topology on the dynamics of diffusion. However, network topologies are not given a priori. Rather, they are patterns of relations that emerge from individual and structural features of society, such as population composition, group heterogeneity, homophily, and social consolidation. Following Blau and Schwartz, the author develops a model of social network formation that explores how social and structural constraints on tie formation generate emergent social topologies and then explores the effectiveness of these social networks for the dynamics of social diffusion. Results show that, at one extreme, high levels of consolidation can create highly balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices. As suggested by Blau and Schwartz, reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion across the population. However, the author finds that further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support the widespread diffusion of norms and practices, indicating that successful social diffusion can depend on moderate to high levels of structural consolidation.",
Why Do Liberals Drink Lattes?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Mar 2015,2015,"Popular accounts of ""lifestyle politics"" and ""culture wars"" suggest that political and ideological divisions extend also to leisure activities, consumption, aesthetic taste, and personal morality. Drawing on a total of 22,572 pairwise correlations from the General Social Survey (1972-2010), the authors provide comprehensive empirical support for the anecdotal accounts. Moreover, most ideological differences in lifestyle cannot be explained by demographic covariates alone. The authors propose a surprisingly simple solution to the puzzle of lifestyle politics. Computational experiments show how the self-reinforcing dynamics of homophily and influence dramatically amplify even very small elective affinities between lifestyle and ideology, producing a stereotypical world of ""latte liberals"" and ""bird-hunting conservatives"" much like the one in which we live.",
Generalized trust and diversity in the classroom: A longitudinal study of Romanian adolescents,COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST STUDIES,Mar 2015,2015,"Generalized trust, the faith we place in strangers, is a fundamental attribute of democratic societies. We investigate the development of generalized trust using survey data collected from Romanian high school students within a multi-level, panel research design. We find that diversity in the classroom, defined through ethnic and socio-economic differences, has negative effects on generalized trust. Associational membership interacts indirectly with diversity, counteracting the negative impact of ethnic diversity but reinforcing socioeconomic distinctions. The findings support cultural theories of generalized trust and point to the potentially positive role educational policy might play in encouraging trust among youths.

Inequality Preservation through Uneven Diffusion of Cultural Materials across Stratified Groups,SOCIAL FORCES,Mar 2015,2015,"Inequality between groups is frequently maintained through the construction and legitimation of inter-group cultural differences. I draw on Blau's multiform heterogeneity and complex contagion models to theorize and develop a relational mechanism that shows how inequality can be preserved when additional, new bases of differentiating between groups layer over existing ones. I investigate the conditions under which variations in the distribution of the population across stratified groups and homophily of social networks along the stratifying attribute interact in such a way that a belief/practice diffuses widely in one group but not the other-an outcome referred to as differential diffusion. I also analyze how size of ego networks and adoption thresholds affect differential diffusion. Using mathematical and agent-based models, I find a positive correlation between adoption thresholds and homophily: when social networks are highly homophilous (e.g., race and socioeconomic class), uneven diffusion of non-normative behavior reproduces inequality; inclusive networks (e.g., in diverse city schools), in contrast, reestablish inequality through differential diffusion of low-risk behavior. This suggests that cultivating diversity is likely to mitigate inequality preservation in conservative situations where adoption of new beliefs/practices needs considerable affirmation. Encouraging status-based solidarity is more appropriate in receptive contexts where adoption of new behaviors entails comparatively lower risk. The results also imply that analyses of diffusion need to be sensitive to contextual factors, including homophily, cultural institutionalization of the diffusing material, and population distribution. Finally, I extend Ridgeway's seminal work to show how relational structure can not only construct status hierarchies but also contribute to their symbolic maintenance.",
Success Factors in Product Seeding: The Role of Homophily,JOURNAL OF RETAILING,Mar 2015,2015,"This study explores the profit impact of seeding programs-giving away free new products to enhance new product diffusion. We conducted extensive agent-based simulation experiments using empirical social connectivity data from five consumer social networks. The findings suggest that the effect of consumer homophily-the similarity of adjacent consumers in a social network-on the profit impact of seeding depends on the seeding target. Consumer homophily negatively affects the profit Impact of seeding early adopters but it exhibits a U-shaped relationship with the profit impact of seeding social hubs and random seeding. The right side of the U-shaped curve (high homophily) reflects a higher profit impact when compared to the left side (low homophily). We integrate literature from sociology, social networks, and marketing to explain this finding. The results also suggest that seeding social hubs generates the greatest NPV (net present value), followed by seeding randomly chosen targets, and early adopters, in that order. Finally, we explore the optimal seeding size-the percentage of the market to seed-and discuss managerial implications for seeding strategies. (C) 2014 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"Isolation-by-distance, homophily, and ""core"" vs. ""package"" cultural evolution models in Neolithic Europe",EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Mar 2015,2015,"Recently there has been growing interest in characterising population structure in cultural data in the context of ongoing debates about the potential of cultural group selection as an evolutionary process. Here we use archaeological data for this purpose, which brings in a temporal as well as spatial dimension. We analyse two distinct material cultures (pottery and personal ornaments) from Neolithic Europe, in order to: a) determine whether archaeologically defined ""cultures"" exhibit marked discontinuities in space and time, supporting the existence of a population structure, or merely isolation-by-distance; and b) investigate the extent to which cultures can be conceived as structuring ""cores"" or as multiple and historically independent ""packages"". Our results support the existence of a robust population structure comparable to previous studies on human culture, and show how the two material cultures exhibit profound differences in their spatial and temporal structuring, signalling different evolutionary trajectories.

Value homophily benefits cooperation but motivates employing incorrect social information,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,Feb 21 2015,2015,"Individuals often judge others based on third-party gossip, rather than their own experience, despite the fact that gossip is error-prone. Rather than judging others on their merits, even when such knowledge is free, we judge based on the opinions of third parties. Here we seek to understand this observation in the context of the evolution of cooperation. If individuals are being judged on noisy social reputations rather than on merit, then agents might exploit this, eroding the sustainability of cooperation. We employ a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Donation game, which has been used to simulate the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity. First, we validate the proposition that adding homophily (the propensity to interact with others of similar beliefs) into a society increases the sustainability of cooperation. However, this creates an evolutionary conflict between the accurate signalling of ingroup status versus the veridical report of the behaviour of other agents. We find that conditions exist where signalling ingroup status outweighs honesty as the best method to ultimately spread cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Harnessing homophily to improve climate change education,ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH,Feb 17 2015,2015,"The Cooperative Extension Service (Extension) in the United States is well positioned to educate the public, particularly farmers and foresters, about climate change and to encourage responsible adoption of adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the climate change attitudes and perceptions of Extension professionals have limited Extension's involvement. A survey of Extension professionals (n = 2758) in eight southern states found several statistically significant factors correlating to different attitudes and perceptions about climate change, such as demographics and program area. Willingness to engage with climate change-related programs varies with climate change perceptions, program area, and perceptions of institutional support. This assessment explores the extent to which the climate change issue suggests different needs among Extension professionals - needs that could be addressed by diverse professional development programs. We discuss these results in the context of homophily and provide recommendations to improve climate change education.",
THE EFFECT OF IN-GROUP FAVORITISM ON THE COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS' OPINIONS,ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS,FEB-MAR 2015,2015,"Empirical findings from social psychology show that sometimes people show favoritism toward in-group members in order to reach a global consensus, even against individuals' own preferences (e.g., altruistically or deontically). Here we integrate ideas and findings on in-group favoritism, opinion dynamics, and radicalization using an agent-based model entitled cooperative bounded confidence (CBC). We investigate the interplay of homophily, rejection, and in-group cooperation drivers on the formation of opinion clusters and the emergence of extremist, radical opinions. Our model is the first to explicitly explore the effect of in-group favoritism on the macro-level, collective behavior of opinions. We compare our model against the two-dimentional bounded confidence model with rejection mechanism, proposed by Huet et al. [Adv. Complex Syst. 13(3) (2010) 405423], and find that the number of opinion clusters and extremists is reduced in our model. Moreover, results show that group influence can never dominate homophilous and rejecting encounters in the process of opinion cluster formation. We conclude by discussing implications of our model for research on collective behavior of opinions emerging from individuals' interaction.",
Nanotechnology researchers' collaboration relationships: A gender analysis of access to scientific information,SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE,Feb 2015,2015,"Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, particularly at higher levels of organizations. This article investigates the impact of this underrepresentation on the processes of interpersonal collaboration in nanotechnology. Analyses are conducted to assess: (1) the comparative tie strength of women's and men's collaborations, (2) whether women and men gain equal access to scientific information through collaborators, (3) which tie characteristics are associated with access to information for women and men, and (4) whether women and men acquire equivalent amounts of information by strengthening ties. Our results show that the overall tie strength is less for women's collaborations and that women acquire less strategic information through collaborators. Women and men rely on different tie characteristics in accessing information, but are equally effective in acquiring additional information resources by strengthening ties. This article demonstrates that the underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics has an impact on the interpersonal processes of scientific collaboration, to the disadvantage of women scientists.",
Homophily in Adolescence: Is Similarity in Status Characteristics Associated with Similarity in Anti-school Behaviour?,YOUNG,Feb 2015,2015,"This study asks to what extent similarity in status characteristics (gender and ethnicity) is linked with similarity in anti-school behaviour. We argue that the social forces responsible for homophily-based selection are also at work with regard to homophily-based influence. We use data from the Flemish Educational Assessment Study, which collected complete network data from a representative sample of Flemish secondary school adolescents (N = 11,872). Results indicate that similarity on gender and ethnicity is linked with similarity on behavioural characteristics. Furthermore, the association between status homophily and behavioural homophily is stronger for boys than girls. For minorities, status heterophily on ethnicity is associated with behavioural heterophily, which may be an indication that minority students distance themselves from their majority-group friends.",
Latent Homophily or Social Influence? An Empirical Analysis of Purchase Within a Social Network,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Feb 2015,2015,"Consumers who are close to one another in a social network often make similar purchase decisions. This similarity can result from latent homophily or social influence, as well as common exogenous factors. Latent homophily means consumers who are connected to one another are likely to have similar characteristics and product preferences. Social influence refers to the ability of one consumer to directly influence another consumer's decision based upon their communication. We present an empirical study of purchases of caller ring-back tones using data from an Asian mobile network that predicts consumers' purchase timing and choice decisions. We simultaneously measure latent homophily and social influence, while also accounting for exogenous factors. Identification is achieved due to our dynamic, panel data structure and the availability of detailed communication data. We find strong influence effects and latent homophily effects in both the purchase timing and product choice decisions of consumers.",
Contact Theory in a Small-Town Settler-Colonial Context: The Reproduction of Laissez-Faire Racism in Indigenous-White Canadian Relations,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Feb 2015,2015,"This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario, Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show that although contact is associated with less old-fashioned prejudice (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processessubtyping, ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance normsinteract to sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics.",
STRUCTURAL HOMOPHILY,INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,Feb 2015,2015,"Homophily, or the fact that similar individuals tend to interact with each other, is a prominent feature of economic and social networks. I show that the equilibrium structure of homophily has empirical power. I build a strategic model of network formation, which produces a unique equilibrium network. Individuals have homophilic preferences and face capacity constraints on the number of links. I develop a novel empirical method, based on the shape of the equilibrium network, which allows for the identification and estimation of the underlying homophilic preferences. I apply this new methodology to the formation of friendship networks.",
Design and characterization of chemical space networks for different compound data sets,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN,Feb 2015,2015,"Chemical Space Networks (CSNs) are generated for different compound data sets on the basis of pairwise similarity relationships. Such networks are thought to complement and further extend traditional coordinate-based views of chemical space. Our proof-of-concept study focuses on CSNs based upon fingerprint similarity relationships calculated using the conventional Tanimoto similarity metric. The resulting CSNs are characterized with statistical measures from network science and compared in different ways. We show that the homophily principle, which is widely considered in the context of social networks, is a major determinant of the topology of CSNs of bioactive compounds, designed as threshold networks, typically giving rise to community structures. Many properties of CSNs are influenced by numerical features of the conventional Tanimoto similarity metric and largely dominated by the edge density of the networks, which depends on chosen similarity threshold values. However, properties of different CSNs with constant edge density can be directly compared, revealing systematic differences between CSNs generated from randomly collected or bioactive compounds.",
"Tolerating the Intolerant: Homophily, Intolerance, and Segregation in Social Balanced Networks",JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION,Feb 2015,2015,"We model a community of individuals whose relationships are governed by the rules of the so-called Heider balance theory, but modified to address the impact of tolerating intolerant individuals. To consider tolerance toward a different group, the elements are assigned one of the two flags, A or B, and the elements of each group can be tolerant or intolerant. Two additional parameters, p and q, respectively, characterize the propensity of elements to cooperate and the propensity of tolerants to reject intolerant attitudes. We find that (1) parameter q does not affect the degree of conflict at the micro level, but has an important influence on the degree of conflict in the whole system; (2) segregation into two cliques occurs whenever there exists intolerants in both groups; (3) when intolerants are present in only one of the groups, segregation can be avoided for appropriate combinations of parameters p and q that depend on the fraction of intolerants and the size of the groups; (4) as the size of the system increases, two balanced solutions dominate: segregation into two cliques or the isolation of intolerants; and (5) endemic partially balanced configurations are observed in large systems.",
Whether information network supplements friendship network,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Feb 1 2015,2015,"Homophily is a significant mechanism for link prediction in complex network, of which principle describes that people with similar profiles or experiences tend to tie with each other. In a multi-relationship network, friendship among people has been utilized to reinforce similarity of taste for recommendation system whose basic idea is similar to homophily, yet how the taste inversely affects friendship prediction is little discussed. This paper contributes to address the issue by analyzing two benchmark data sets both including user's behavioral information of taste and friendship based on the principle of homophily. It can be found that the creation of friendship tightly associates with personal taste. Especially, the behavioral information of taste involving with popular objects is much more effective to improve the performance of friendship prediction. However, this result seems to be contradictory to the finding in Zhang et al. (2013) that the behavior information of taste involving with popular objects is redundant in recommendation system. We thus discuss this inconformity to comprehensively understand the correlation between them. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
What are Chinese talking about in hot weibos?,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Feb 1 2015,2015,"SinaWeibo is a Twitter-like social network service emerging in China recently. We analyzed the hot weibos (tweets), which exceed threshold of being reposted for 1000 times, from a data set of 650 million weibos during August 2009 and January 2012. We classified the hot weibos into eight categories, namely Entertainment & Fashion, Hot Social Events, Leisure & Mood, Life & Health, Seeking for Help, Sales Promotion, Fengshui & Fortune and Deleted weibos. There are several findings. Firstly, Leisure & Mood and Hot Social Events account for almost 65% of all the hot weibos. This may indicate a potential dual-structure of the current society of China: On the one hand, economy of the country as a whole is gaining sustaining growth, which enables people to enjoy a better life and spare more time on leisure and mood topics. On the other hand, there still exist considerable amount of serious social problems, such as government corruption and environmental pollution, which draw people's concern and worries all the time. Secondly, users' posting and reposting behaviors are associated with user profiles, namely: (1) Gender. Male users generate two thirds of hot weibos. (2) Verification status. Verified users contribute 46.5% of hot weibos, who comprise only 0.1% in SinaWeibo user population. Interestingly, 39.2% of the verified-user-generated weibos are written by SPA users (who generate weibos of a particular style, or in a consistent way, e.g. to say words of wisdom, ""chicken-soup-soul"" like sentences, and jokes etc.). This complements the previous finding of Yu et al. (2012), implying that SinaWeibo is in an ""artificial inflation"" not only on the reposting side but also on the posting side. Unfortunately, only 14.4% of the hot weibos are created by grassroots (not verified users). (3) Geographical location. Users from different areas of China show distinct posting and reposting behaviors, which partially reflect their indigenous cultures. Finally, homophily is also examined for people's reposting behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Diverse Workplaces and Interethnic Friendship Formation-A Multilevel Comparison across 21 OECD Countries,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,Jan 28 2015,2015,"We study how workplace diversity affects how native-born populations form interethnic friendship relations. Drawing on network elasticity research, the relationship between functional and cognitive interdependencies, and intergroup contact theory, we argue that diverse workplaces-because they restrict individuals' opportunities to act on tendencies towards homophily more than other social units-have a particularly strong potential for integration. We test our argument by analysing data from the first round of the European Social Survey with multilevel modelling. In line with expectations, we find that individuals who work at diverse workplaces are more likely than individuals who work at homogenous workplaces to have immigrant friends; that workplace diversity is more efficacious than neighbourhood diversity in generating interethnic friendship relations; and that the association between workplace diversity and the likelihood of having immigrant friends is stronger among individuals who have a low level of education, feel economically vulnerable, and who live in countries characterized by relative resource scarcity.",
Ethnic Boundaries in Core Discussion Networks: A Multilevel Social Network Study of Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands,JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES,Jan 2 2015,2015,"This study examines ethnic segregation of core discussion networks in the Netherlands. The analysis is based on Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, a large-scale survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 that contains an oversample of first- and second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Morocco, the two largest non-western immigrant groups in Holland. Results show that among Turks and Moroccans, more than 75% of the confidants are co-ethnic multilevel logistic models of these ego networks which suggest that ethnic closure in core discussion networks of Turks and Moroccans is stronger among women, foreign-born immigrants, those who live in immigrant concentration areas and those who are culturally more dissimilar to the Dutch to (i.e., who speak Dutch less well, who more strongly participate in Muslim practices and who identify stronger with their ethnic group). Results further suggest that the socio-economic gradient in ethnic boundaries is due to both cultural and economic homophily.",
Bias-variance and breadth-depth tradeoffs in respondent-driven sampling,JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION,Jan 2 2015,2015,"Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a link-tracing network sampling strategy for collecting data from hard-to-reach populations, such as injection drug users or individuals at high risk of being infected with HIV. The mechanism is to find initial participants (seeds), and give each of them a fixed number of coupons allowing them to recruit people they know from the population of interest, with a mutual financial incentive. The new participants are again given coupons and the process repeats. Currently, the standard RDS estimator used in practice is known as the Volz-Heckathorn (VH) estimator. It relies on strong assumptions about the underlying social network and the RDS process. Via simulation, we study the relative performance of the plain mean and VH estimators when assumptions of the latter are not satisfied, under different network types (including homophily and rich-get-richer networks), participant referral patterns, and varying number of coupons. The analysis demonstrates that the plain mean outperforms the VH estimator in many but not all of the simulated settings, including homophily networks. Also, we highlight the implications of multiple recruitment and varying referral patterns on the depth of RDS process. We develop interactive visualizations of the findings and RDS process to further build insight into the various factors contributing to the performance of current RDS estimation techniques.",
Institutions and Cultural Diversity: Effects of Democratic and Propaganda Processes on Local Convergence and Global Diversity.,Figshare,2018-06-18,2015,"In a connected world where people influence each other, what can cause a globalized monoculture, and which measures help to preserve the coexistence of cultures? Previous research has shown that factors such as homophily, population size, geography, mass media, and type of social influence play important roles. In the present paper, we investigate for the first time the impact that institutions have on cultural diversity. In our first three studies, we extend existing agent-based models and explore the effects of institutional influence and agent loyalty. We find that higher institutional influence increases cultural diversity, while individuals' loyalty to their institutions has a small, preserving effect. In three further studies, we test how bottom-up and top-down processes of institutional influence impact our model. We find that bottom-up democratic practices, such as referenda, tend to produce convergence towards homogeneity, while top-down information dissemination practices, such as propaganda, further increase diversity. In our last model - an integration of bottom-up and top-down processes into a feedback loop of information - we found that when democratic processes are rare, the effects of propaganda are amplified, i.e. more diversity emerges; however, when democratic processes are common, they are able to neutralize or even reverse this propaganda effect. Importantly, our models allow for control over the full spectrum of diversity, so that a manipulation of our variables can result in preferred levels of diversity, which will be useful for the study of other factors in the future. We discuss possible mechanisms behind our results, possible applications, and implications for political and social sciences. Copyright: CC0",
Semi-supervised Learning with Explicit Relationship Regularization,2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR),2015,2015,"In many learning tasks, the structure of the target space of a function holds rich information about the relationships between evaluations of functions on different data points. Existing approaches attempt to exploit this relationship information implicitly by enforcing smoothness on function evaluations only. However, what happens if we explicitly regularize the relationships between function evaluations? Inspired by homophily, we regularize based on a smooth relationship function, either defined from the data or with labels. In experiments, we demonstrate that this significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in semi-supervised classification and in spectral data embedding for constrained clustering and dimensionality reduction.",
"The Center Cannot Hold Networks, Echo Chambers, and Polarization",ORDER ON THE EDGE OF CHAOS: SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL ORDER,2015,2015,"A longstanding literature in the social sciences - from James Madison to James Hunter and from Robert Dahl to John Rawls - regards opinion polarization as a threat to social order. Yet consensus may prove equally harmful due to the stifling effects of ""monoculture."" Contemporary social and political theorists have proposed a pluralist alternative in which cross-cutting divisions maintain diversity and tolerance. In this chapter, we examine polarization, consensus, and pluralism from a relational network perspective. We cite empirical evidence from studies of political polarization and cultural fragmentation suggesting that alignment across issue dimensions extends beyond hot button identity politics to include seemingly arbitrary lifestyle preferences. While pluralist theorists typically assume that cross-cutting divisions foster mutual tolerance and maintain diversity, we show that pluralism can also become unstable due to the self-reinforcing dynamics of homophily and social influence.",
Does implied community size predict likeability of a similar stranger?,EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jan 2015,2015,"Homophily, the tendency for people to cluster with similar others, has primarily been studied in terms of proximal, psychological causes, such as a tendency to have positive associations with people who share traits with us. Here we investigate whether homophily could be correlated with perceived group membership, given that sharing traits with other people might signify membership of a specific community. In order to investigate this, we tested whether the amount of homophily that occurs between strangers is dependent on the number of people they believe share the common trait (i.e. the size of group that the trait identifies). In two experiments, we show that more exclusive (smaller) groups evoke more positive ratings of the likeability of a stranger. When groups appear to be too inclusive (i.e. large) homophily no longer occurs, suggesting that it is not only positive associations with a trait that cause homophily, but a sense of the exclusiveness of a group is also important. These results suggest that group membership based on a variety of traits can encourage cohesion between people from diverse backgrounds, and may be a useful tool in overcoming differences between groups.

Extending generative models of large scale networks,"6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS (AHFE 2015) AND THE AFFILIATED CONFERENCES, AHFE 2015",2015,2015,"Since the launch of Facebook in 2004 and Twitter in 2006, the amount of publicly available social network data has grown in both scale and complexity. This growth presents significant challenges to conventional network analysis methods that rely primarily on structure. In this paper, we describe a generative model that extends structure-based connection preference methods to include preferences based on agent similarity or homophily. We also discuss novel methods for extracting model parameters from existing large scale networks (e.g., Twitter) to improve model accuracy. We demonstrate the validity of our proposed extensions and parameter extraction methods by comparing model-generated networks with and without the extensions to real-life networks based on metrics for both structure and homophily. Finally we discuss the potential implications for including homophily in models of social networks and information propagation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",
Quantification in Social Networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS (IEEE DSAA 2015),2015,2015,"In many real-world applications there is a need to monitor the distribution of a population across different classes, and to track changes in this distribution over time. As an example, an important task is to monitor the percentage of unemployed adults in a given region. When the membership of an individual in a class cannot be established deterministically, a typical solution is the classification task. However, in the above applications the final goal is not determining which class the individuals belong to, but estimating the prevalence of each class in the unlabeled data. This task is called quantification. Most of the work in the literature addressed the quantification problem considering data presented in conventional attribute format. Since the ever-growing availability of web and social media we have a flourish of network data representing a new important source of information and by using quantification network techniques we could quantify collective behavior, i.e., the number of users that are involved in certain type of activities, preferences, or behaviors. In this paper we exploit the homophily effect observed in many social networks in order to construct a quantifier for networked data. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and the comparison with the existing state-of-the-art quantification methods shows that they are more accurate.",
Effect of gender and call duration on customer satisfaction in call center big data,"16TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION (INTERSPEECH 2015), VOLS 1-5",2015,2015,"Customer center call data is typically collected by organizations and corporations in order to improve customer experience through the analysis of such call data. In this paper, we report our findings when analysing more than 26 thousand calls to the call centers of a large corporation in a Latin American country. We focus on the impact of gender and call duration on self reported customer satisfaction. Speech-based gender detection technology is employed to automatically detect the gender of the customer and the agent involved in the calls. A significant correlation is found between self-reported customer satisfaction at the end of the call and gender homophily between the customer and the call center's agent. Interestingly, we do not find any significant effect of call duration on satisfaction.",

This may have implications on graph prediction tasks, as well as on the design of 3D-printable content repositories.",
SNCStream: A Social Network-based Data Stream Clustering Algorithm,"30TH ANNUAL ACM SYMPOSIUM ON APPLIED COMPUTING, VOLS I AND II",2015,2015,"Data Stream Clustering is an active area of research which requires efficient algorithms capable of finding and updating clusters incrementally. On top of that, due to the inherent evolving nature of data streams, it is expected that these algorithms manage to quickly adapt to both concept drifts and the appearance and disappearance of clusters. Nevertheless, many of the developed two-step algorithms are only capable of finding hyper-spherical clusters and are highly dependant on parametrization. In this paper we introduce SNCStream, a one-step online clustering algorithm based on Social Networks Theory, which uses homophily to find non-hyper-spherical clusters. Our empirical studies show that SNCStream is able to surpass density-based algorithms in cluster quality and requires feasible amount of resources (time and memory) when compared to other algorithms.",
Social Boundary of Any Two Nodes in a Social Network,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 7TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBERNETICS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (CIS) AND ROBOTICS, AUTOMATION AND MECHATRONICS (RAM)",2015,2015,"It is generally accepted that the driving forces of establishing connections among people are social influence and homophily. Both of them eventually lead to the proximity of any two related individuals to some extent. However, a person always can be featured with some attributes different from his/her social networking partners. Accordingly, one person's direct and indirect social relationships are likely to intersect with others at some nodes in social networks. In this work, we study the novel task of identifying the hidden boundary that divides the social network into disjoint social circles according to any pair of nodes which we call social boundary. We put forward two methods to separate the social circles of any two nodes and thus can find out the social boundary. One is based on label propagation and the other is based on perceptron network model. We apply the methods on synthetic and real networks, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the areas in which it would be applied.",
Inequality as a Barrier to Green Building Policy Adoptions in Cities,SUSTAINABLE HUMAN-BUILDING ECOSYSTEMS,2015,2015,"How might social inequality influence local government decisions to adopt green building incentives or mandates? Extant research has considered the influence that political homophily, environmental activism, and pressure groups play in the spread of sustainability policies. But to what extent do concerns over environmental justice motivate local government adoption of green building, development, and remodeling programs? This study begins to disentangle these questions by asking: do cities within regions with higher levels of social inequality adopt green building policies less frequently than those in areas of lower inequality? Using national survey data, we find measures of wealth and ""reformed"" government positively influence the use of green-building tools, while regional income inequality dampens these effects.",
Context-aware Service Discovery and Selection in Decentralized Environments,"CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY - UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS - DEPENDABLE, AUTONOMIC AND SECURE COMPUTING - PERVASIVE INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING",2015,2015,"With the increasing use of web services in everyday tasks, we are entering an era of Internet of Services (IoS). Service discovery and selection has become critical issue in the area of web services. Traditional service discovery approaches are often supported by centralized registries that could suffer from single point failure, performance bottleneck, and scalability issues in large scale systems. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a context-aware service discovery and selection approach in a decentralized peer-to-peer environment. In the approach homophily similarity was used for bootstrapping and distribution of nodes. The discovery process is based on the similarity of nodes, previous interaction and behaviour of the nodes, which will help the discovery process in a dynamic environment. Our approach is not only considering service discovery, but also the selection of the best available web service by taking into account the QoS properties of the web services. Experimental results were based on real world semantic web service dataset, the results showed that the approach achieved better performance and efficiency in both discovery and selection processes.",
Fuzzy Homophily In Social Networks,2015 4th Iranian Joint Congress on Fuzzy and Intelligent Systems (CFIS),2015,2015,"In the last several years, the study of social networks analysis has gained much interest from the research community. An active research topic is to investigate the structure of social networks, i.e. studying the processes that affect the formation of relationships in a social network. One of the most fundamental notions governing the structure of social networks is homophily. This principle provides us with an illustration of how a network's surrounding contexts can drive the formation of its links. Given a particular characteristic of interest like religion, gender and individuals' connections, we concerned to answer to this question ""does the network exhibits homophily according to individuals' characteristic?"" For this purpose, we proposed a new method that uses fuzzy concepts to measure social network homophily. In contrast to the traditional approaches, our method handles non-deterministic information in homophily detection process. We applied our approach on a sample dataset drawn from CLOOB social network service. The experimental results demonstrate our approach reaches good efficiency.",

An Initial Homophily Indicator to Reinforce Context-Aware Semantic Computing,"PROCEEDINGS 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS CICSYN 2015",2015,2015,"The vast increase of personal sensor information is driving the rise in popularity of context-aware applications. Users crave and very often expect tailored services that are based on the users' context or personal preferences. The users themselves, using forms, often provide such information. An inference solution typically addresses this problem. In this paper, we present and show by way of a real-world example, the first step towards incorporating information of the user's social networking behavior in the inference task. We define an initial indicator of a particular social phenomenon, called Homophily, and describe how the indicator measures the presence of homophily at certain moments, also capturing the degree to which it is present. Different from existing indicators, ours lends itself to indicating the presence of homophily in a way that is easier to comprehend, so that it may be easily integrated into and reinforce context-aware semantic computing.",
Toward Precise User-Topic Alignment in Online Social Media,PROCEEDINGS 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA,2015,2015,"Mining users'= topics of interest is one of the most important tasks for social media services. Given known topic associations for some fraction of the users in an online microblogging platform, our goal is to infer the topics of interest for the remaining users in the same site. Specifically, we proposed a novel bi-relational graph model to capture the interactions among users and their shared topics of interests. The proposed graph model contains two sub-graphs: one corresponds to users and the other corresponds to topics. Such a representation allows for effective exploitation of both user homophily relation and topic correlation simultaneously. This is in contrast with previous work where these two factors are considered in isolation. Subsequently, the user interest discovery problem is formulated as a multi-label learning problem on the bi-relational graph, with the goal to estimate the optimized associations between user nodes and topic nodes across the two sub-graphs. Our experiment is carried out with a complete month-long data collected from Twitter and Tumblr via GNIP Decahose(1) and Firehose(2) respectively. The large-scale studies shed light on the effectiveness of inferring user interests based on the underlying social connections.",
Scalable Adaptive Label Propagation in Grappa,PROCEEDINGS 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA,2015,2015,"Nodes of a social graph often represent entities with specific labels, denoting properties such as age-group or gender. Design of algorithms to assign labels to unlabeled nodes by leveraging node-proximity and a-priori labels of seed nodes is of significant interest. A semi-supervised approach to solve this problem is termed ""LPA-Label Propagation Algorithm"" where labels of a subset of nodes are iteratively propagated through the network to infer yet unknown node labels. While LPA for node labelling is extremely fast and simple, it works well only with an assumption of node-homophily - connected nodes are connected because they must deserve a similar label - which can often be a misnomer. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm ""Adaptive Label Propagation"" that dynamically adapts to the underlying characteristics of homophily, heterophily, or otherwise, of the connections of the network, and applies suitable label propagation strategies accordingly. Moreover, our adaptive label propagation approach is scalable as demonstrated by its implementation in Grappa, a distributed shared-memory system. Our experiments on social graphs from Facebook, YouTube, Live Journal, Orkut and Netlog demonstrate that our approach not only improves the labelling accuracy but also computes results for millions of users within a few seconds.",
Mass ideology-based voting model,"2015 IEEE ADVANCED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONIC AND AUTOMATION CONTROL CONFERENCE (IAEAC)",2015,2015,"As one of the powerful tools in political science, ideal point estimation is always used to study the pattern behind the senators' voting behavior. In order to give a comprehensive estimation of senators' political positions, some researchers estimated the ideal points on different topics. However, for those senators who are not that polarized, their ideal points are so sensitive to the voting records that even a small change will make a big difference, which may mislead the readers.In this paper, we propose a mass ideology-based voting model taking the senators' latent ideology into consideration. Firstly, we model the senators' general ideal points by using the following links on Twitter due to the reason that we have homophily in social networks. Secondly, we use the roll call data of different bills, which can be decomposed as a combination of different topics, to estimate the senator's adjustment on different topics. Finally, we combine the general ideal points and the adjustments together to analyze the senator's political positions. Additionally, two-stage learning algorithms are also shown in the following section. Compared with the Issued-Adjusted model, our model has an edge on classifying the senators on different topics. This model can also be used to predict the voting behavior. Then, we show a case study of a moderate senator and try to explain her voting behavior for some bills according to our research.",
Factors Influencing e-WOM through SNS: Focus on China Weibo,Journal of International Area Studies,2015,2015,"Recently there is an increasing trend of searching and sharing the information through social network service such as twitter, facebook, etc.. Social network service created a new channel of information flow via consumer-to-consumer communication and it can made the electronic word of mouth(eWOM) effect more powerful. Much research has been done about WOM effects in online environment, but few research has been done for electronic word of mouth(eWOM) effect through social network service in China, even though its expanding importance in practical and academic marketing environment. Therefore this study examined which factors influencing eWOM effects via social network service environments, especially Weibo(微博), the most popular social network service in China now. Before the empirical analyses, this study reviewed theoretical background for social network service and electronic word of mouth(eWOM). Then a research model that identifies tie strength, homophily, expertise, consensus, vividness, timeliness, trust and usefulness are as an important antecedent to eWOM effect in social network service environments was developed and tested. The results can be summarized as follows. First, the trust of information through social network service were strongest when the social network service users are similar. Secondly, the usefulness was more influenced by the independent variable timeliness rather than other independent variable. Thirdly, expertise are positively associated with the trust of information, whereas a negative relationship was found with the usefulness of information. The last one, consensus are positively associated with the usefulness but no relationship was found with the trust .",
Influence of Homophily and Tie Strength on Purchase Intention on Microblog-based SNSs through Perceived Diagnosticity,The Journal of Internet Electronic Commerce Research,2015,2015,"Social network services(SNSs) change existing marketing practices because people are relying more on the members of their own networks to guide their decision making. Lots of people share product information or shopping experience on microblog-based SNSs. When one peer posts certain information about a product on a microblog-based SNS, some of his/her followers may become willing to purchase that product after reviewing the information. We suggested a research model based on the Stimuli-Organism-Response (SOR) framework. Homophily was adopted as the predictor of tie strength. We considered homophily and tie strength as stimuli, perceived diagnosticity as organism, and purchase intention as response. We empirically tested the model and tried to provide some valuable and applicable implications for both researchers and practitioners.",
Homophily Among VAA Users: the case of Ecuador,2015 SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDEMOCRACY & EGOVERNMENT (ICEDEG),2015,2015,"Users who recommended a Voting Advice Application online platform to others in their social networks were ""tied"" to any individuals who elected to follow the recommendation, in order to form a network dataset. This study examines the homophily hypothesis, the tendency of Inviters and Invitees to be disproportionately similar in demographics, political orientation and attitudes for VAA-generated data, employing random y-permutation statistical techniques borrowed from Social Network Analysis. The results confirm the homophily hypothesis, with Invitees being more similar with their respective Inviters, than would have been expected by chance or population make-up for all variables examined, demographic, political and attitudinal, with the exception of gender.",
POLITICAL EFFICACY ON THE INTERNET: A MEDIA SYSTEM DEPENDENCY APPROACH,"COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES ANNUAL: POLITICS, PARTICIPATION, AND PRODUCTION",2015,2015,"Grounded in Media System Dependency theory, this work investigates the impact of new media on political efficacy. It suggests that dependence on online resources affects people's perceptions about the democratic potential of the Internet. Using structural equation modeling, the study tests the relationship between political attitudes and the perceived utility of the Web. The analysis employs measures that take into consideration the facilitating role of communication technologies. Results indicate that online political efficacy is associated with individual views about the comprehensiveness and credibility of new media. Efficacy is also linked to the perceived ability of online tools to aid the maintenance of ideologically homogenous social networks. The intensity of Internet dependency relations is found to be predicted by the perceived comprehensiveness - but not credibility - of online news.",

Effect of Media Usage Selection on Social Mobilization Speed: Facebook vs E-Mail,Figshare,2016-01-14,2015,"Social mobilization is a process that enlists a large number of people to achieve a goal within a limited time, especially through the use of social media. There is increasing interest in understanding the factors that affect the speed of social mobilization. Based on the Langley Knights competition data set, we analyzed the differences in mobilization speed between users of Facebook and e-mail. We include other factors that may influence mobilization speed (gender, age, timing, and homophily of information source) in our model as control variables in order to isolate the effect of such factors. We show that, in this experiment, although more people used e-mail to recruit, the mobilization speed of Facebook users was faster than that of those that used e-mail. We were also able to measure and show that the mobilization speed for Facebook users was on average seven times faster compared to e-mail before controlling for other factors. After controlling for other factors, we show that Facebook users were 1.84 times more likely to register compared to e-mail users in the next period if they have not done so at any point in time. This finding could provide useful insights for future social mobilization efforts.",
Competition between Homophily and Information Entropy Maximization in Social Networks,Figshare,2016-01-14,2015,"In social networks, it is conventionally thought that two individuals with more overlapped friends tend to establish a new friendship, which could be stated as homophily breeding new connections. While the recent hypothesis of maximum information entropy is presented as the possible origin of effective navigation in small-world networks. We find there exists a competition between information entropy maximization and homophily in local structure through both theoretical and experimental analysis. This competition suggests that a newly built relationship between two individuals with more common friends would lead to less information entropy gain for them. We demonstrate that in the evolution of the social network, both of the two assumptions coexist. The rule of maximum information entropy produces weak ties in the network, while the law of homophily makes the network highly clustered locally and the individuals would obtain strong and trust ties. A toy model is also presented to demonstrate the competition and evaluate the roles of different rules in the evolution of real networks. Our findings could shed light on the social network modeling from a new perspective.",
Institutions and Cultural Diversity: Effects of Democratic and Propaganda Processes on Local Convergence and Global Diversity.,Zenodo,2015-12-17,2015,"In a connected world where people influence each other, what can cause a globalized monoculture, and which measures help to preserve the coexistence of cultures? Previous research has shown that factors such as homophily, population size, geography, mass media, and type of social influence play important roles. In the present paper, we investigate for the first time the impact that institutions have on cultural diversity. In our first three studies, we extend existing agent-based models and explore the effects of institutional influence and agent loyalty. We find that higher institutional influence increases cultural diversity, while individuals&#39; loyalty to their institutions has a small, preserving effect. In three further studies, we test how bottom-up and top-down processes of institutional influence impact our model. We find that bottom-up democratic practices, such as referenda, tend to produce convergence towards homogeneity, while top-down information dissemination practices, such as propaganda, further increase diversity. In our last model &ndash; an integration of bottom-up and top-down processes into a feedback loop of information &ndash; we found that when democratic processes are rare, the effects of propaganda are amplified, i.e. more diversity emerges; however, when democratic processes are common, they are able to neutralize or even reverse this propaganda effect. Importantly, our models allow for control over the full spectrum of diversity, so that a manipulation of our variables can result in preferred levels of diversity, which will be useful for the study of other factors in the future. We discuss possible mechanisms behind our results, possible applications, and implications for political and social sciences.",
Inferring Social Status and Rich Club Effects in Enterprise Communication Networks,Figshare,2016-01-12,2015,"Social status, defined as the relative rank or position that an individual holds in a social hierarchy, is known to be among the most important motivating forces in social behaviors. In this paper, we consider the notion of status from the perspective of a position or title held by a person in an enterprise. We study the intersection of social status and social networks in an enterprise. We study whether enterprise communication logs can help reveal how social interactions and individual status manifest themselves in social networks. To that end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication channels &#8212; voice call, short message, and email &#8212; to demonstrate the social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status. We have several interesting findings and based on these findings we also develop a model to predict social status. On the individual level, high-status individuals are more likely to be spanned as structural holes by linking to people in parts of the enterprise networks that are otherwise not well connected to one another. On the community level, the principle of homophily, social balance and clique theory generally indicate a &#8220;rich club&#8221; maintained by high-status individuals, in the sense that this community is much more connected, balanced and dense. Our model can predict social status of individuals with 93% accuracy.",
A Tale of Two Communities: Assessing Homophily in Node-Link Diagrams,"GRAPH DRAWING AND NETWORK VISUALIZATION, GD 2015",2015,2015,"Homophily is a concept in social network analysis that states that in a network a link is more probable, if the two individuals have a common characteristic. We study the question if an observer can assess homophily by looking at the node-link diagram of the network. We design an experiment that investigates three different layout algorithms and asks the users to estimate the degree of homophily in the displayed network. One of the layout algorithms is a classical force-directed method, the other two are designed to improve node distinction based on the common characteristic. We study how each of the three layout algorithms helps to get a fair estimate, and whether there is a tendency to over or underestimate the degree of homophily. The stimuli in our experiments use different network sizes and different proportions of the cluster sizes.",
An empirical analysis of students’ friendship ties formation,Applied Econometrics,2015,2015,"We consider the structure of social network of university students, and analyze factors that lead to the personal communication (friendship) network formation. Using the data from student survey and administrative information, we estimate the econometric models that assume homophily and propinquity effects on the likelihood of being friends.

The results confirm the significance of such friendship formation factors as sharing the same study group, living in dormitory, similar academic achievement and having the same gender. The probability of a tie increases with the number of similar attributes.",
When does metric use matter less? How firm and managerial characteristics moderate the relationship between metric use and marketing mix performance,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING,2015,2015,"Purpose - This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework, in an effort toward building a contingent theory of drivers and consequences of managerial metric use in marketing mix decisions, this paper develops a conceptual framework to test whether the relationship between metric use and marketing mix performance is moderated by firm and managerial characteristics.Design/methodology/approach - Based on reviews of the marketing, finance, management and accounting literatures, and homophily, firm resource-and decision-maker-based theories and 22 managerial interviews, a conceptual model is proposed. It is tested via generalized least squares - seemingly unrelated regression estimation of 1,287 managerial decisions.Findings - Results suggest that the impact of metric use on marketing mix performance is lower in firms which are more market oriented, larger and with worse recent business performance and for marketing and higher-level managers, while organizational involvement has a lesser nuanced effect.Research limitations/implications - While much is written on the importance of metric use to improve performance, this work is a first step toward understanding which settings are more difficult than others to accomplish this.Practical implications - Results allow identification of several conditional managerial strategies to improve marketing mix performance based on metric use.Originality/value - This paper contributes to the metric literature, as prior research has generally focused on the development of metrics or the linking of marketing efforts with performance metrics, but paid little attention to understanding the relationship between managerial metric use and performance of the marketing mix decision and has not considered how the relationship is moderated by firm and managerial characteristics.",
Do Birds of a Feather Watch Each Other? Homophily and Social Surveillance in Location Based Social Networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK AND SOCIAL COMPUTING (CSCW'15),2015,2015,"Location sharing applications (LSA) have proliferated in recent years. Current research principally focuses on egocentric privacy issues and design but has historically not explored the impact of surveillance on location sharing behavior. In this paper, we examine homophily in friendship and surveillance networks for 65 foursquare users. Our results indicate that location surveillance networks are strongly homophilous along the lines of race and gender while friendship networks are weakly homophilous on income. Qualitatively, an analysis of comments and interviews provides support for a discourse around location surveillance, which is mainly social, collaborative, positive and participatory. We relate these findings with prior literature on surveillance, self presentation and homophily and situate this study in existing HCl/CSCW scholarship.",
Pairwise structural role mining for user categorization in information cascades,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2015),2015,2015,"It is well known that many social networks follow the homophily principle, dictating that individuals tend to connect with similar peers. Past studies focused on non-topological properties, such as the age, gender, beliefs or educations. In this paper we focus precisely on the topology itself, exploring the possible existence of pairwise role dependency, that is, purely structural homophily. We show that while pairwise dependency is necessary for some structural roles, it may be misleading for others. We also present SR-Diffuse, a novel method for identifying the structural roles of nodes within a network. It is an iterative algorithm following an optimization model able to learn simultaneously from topological features and structural homophily, combining both aspects. For assessing our method, we applied it in a classification problem in information cascades, comparing its performance against several baseline methods. The experimental results with Flickr and Digg data show that SR-Diffuse can improve the quality of the discovered roles and can better represent the profile of the individuals, leading to a better prediction of social classes within information cascades.",
Using weak ties to understand resource usage behaviors in an online community of educators,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2015),2015,2015,"We show that weak ties offer a useful theoretical lens for understanding the sharing and usage of community-contributed resources amongst educators in a large urban school district. Community-contributed resources include a rich variety of teaching and learning resources such as lesson plans, presentation slides, animations and simulations. In this research, we consider whether the deduced relationships between members of the community constitute weak ties. A deduced relationship exists when two community members view or access the same resource. If these deduced relationships do constitute weak ties then other theorized network properties should also be manifest, namely homophily and triadic closures. Our findings support these theoretical conjectures. Firstly, results indicate that the strength of a tie is directly proportional to the level of similarity between users in the network (homophily property). Secondly, we found strong support for the triadic closure property as well; we developed a computational model to predict the formation of weak ties via triadic closures with an accuracy of 97.8%. Insights from our model can be used to improve a collaborative filtering approach for resource recommendation by predicting future similarity between users in the network.",
Playing with Strangers: Which Shared Traits Attract Us Most to New People?,Figshare,2016-01-13,2015,"Homophily, the tendency for individuals to associate with those who are most similar to them, has been well documented. However, the influence of different kinds of similarity (e.g. relating to age, music taste, ethical views) in initial preferences for a stranger have not been compared. In the current study, we test for a relationship between sharing a variety of traits (i.e. having different kinds of similarity) with a stranger and the perceived likeability of that stranger. In two online experiments, participants were introduced to a series of virtual partners with whom they shared traits, and subsequently carried out activities designed to measure positivity directed towards those partners. Greater numbers of shared traits led to linearly increasing ratings of partner likeability and ratings on the Inclusion of Other in Self scale. We identified several consistent predictors of these two measures: shared taste in music, religion and ethical views. These kinds of trait are likely to be judged as correlates of personality or social group, and may therefore be used as proxies of more in-depth information about a person who might be socially more relevant.",
"Homophily, Close Friendship, and Life Satisfaction among Gay, Lesbian, Heterosexual, and Bisexual Men and Women",Figshare,2016-01-13,2015,"Friends play important roles throughout our lives by providing expressive, instrumental, and companionate support. We examined sexual orientation, gender, and age differences in the number of friends people can rely on for expressive, instrumental, and companionate support. Additionally, we examined the extent to which people relied on same-gender versus cross-gender friends for these types of support. Participants (N = 25,185) completed a survey via a popular news website. Sexual orientation differences in number of same-gender and cross-gender friends were generally small or non-existent, and satisfaction with friends was equally important to overall life satisfaction for all groups. However, the extent to which peoples friendship patterns demonstrated gender-based homophily varied by sexual orientation, gender, and age.

A Complex Network-Based Anytime Data Stream Clustering Algorithm,"NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, PT I",2015,2015,"Data stream mining is an active area of research that poses challenging research problems. In the latter years, a variety of data stream clustering algorithms have been proposed to perform unsupervised learning using a two-step framework. Additionally, dealing with non-stationary, unbounded data streams requires the development of algorithms capable of performing fast and incremental clustering addressing time and memory limitations without jeopardizing clustering quality. In this paper we present CNDenStream, a one-step data stream clustering algorithm capable of finding non-hyper-spherical clusters which, in opposition to other data stream clustering algorithms, is able to maintain updated clusters after the arrival of each instance by using a complex network construction and evolution model based on homophily. Empirical studies show that CNDenStream is able to surpass other algorithms in clustering quality and requires a feasible amount of resources when compared to other algorithms presented in the literature.",
Homophily of Vocabulary Usage: Beneficial Effects of Vocabulary Similarity on Online Health Communities Participation.,AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings. AMIA Symposium,2015,2015,"Online health communities provide popular platforms for individuals to exchange psychosocial support and form ties. Although regular active participation (i.e., posting to interact with other members) in online health communities can provide important benefits, sustained active participation remains challenging for these communities. Leveraging previous literature on homophily (i.e., ""love of those who are like themselves""), we examined the relationship between vocabulary similarity (i.e., homophily of word usage) of thread posts and members' future interaction in online health communities. We quantitatively measured vocabulary similarity by calculating, in a vector space model, cosine similarity between the original post and the first reply in 20,499 threads. Our findings across five online health communities suggest that vocabulary similarity is a significant predictor of members' future interaction in online health communities. These findings carry practical implications for facilitating and sustaining online community participation through beneficial effects of homophily in the vocabulary of essential peer support.",

Modeling Social Network Influence on Joint Trip Frequency for Regular Activity Travel Decisions,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,2015,2015,"Interest in activity-based travel demand modeling has recently increased significantly because of the level of accuracy offered by this type of modeling and its applicability in travel behavior research. Understanding the linkage between social influence and travel behavior enables efficient characterization of discretionary activities that account for a major fraction of total urban trips. In particular, some recent studies looked at the social network structure of individuals and measured the influence that social network members have on the performance of social activities. However, it is expected that the process of taking joint trips (trips that individuals take with their network members) has an intrinsic social context for different activities in general (not only social activities). In this regard, this study used an egocentric (i.e., personal) network approach to explore empirically the influence of personal network characteristics on the frequency of weekly trips that individuals (egos) took part in with their personal network members (alters). With the help of zero inflated Poisson models and egocentric social network data, the results of this study present a framework for predicting the number of joint trips for six types of activities: work, eating out, shopping, recreation, study, and extracurricular activities. Estimation findings suggest that personal network measures such as network density, homophily, heterogeneity, and ego alter tie attributes have a significant impact on the joint trip-making process, that is, the number of weekly shared trips in which an individual participates. The findings of this study should help practitioners implement targeted policies such as car sharing for various user groups.",
A Sociality-Aware Online AP Association Algorithm Based on Spectral Clustering,2015 IEEE 28TH CANADIAN CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (CCECE),2015,2015,"Imbalanced load distribution among multiple APs (access points) has become a serious problem in enterprise WLANs. Load imbalance causes inefficiency of network usage and unreasonable resource allocation. We find that users tend to come and leave together, which can lead to fluctuation of network load. We propose a novel online AP allocation scheme (ASC) to keep load balanced when users come and leave together. We study the homophily of users in social network, where users with tight social relationships will have more similar network usage and more opportunity to leave in union. When users come, we collect user data first, then we adopt the spectral clustering to classify users according to the collected user data. The controller distribute users from the same cluster to different APs. Through the simulation, we find that our scheme improve the overall balancing performance by at least 22% compared with the least load first selection algorithm (LLF) and 58% compared with random selection algorithm (RS).",
Towards an Intelligent Application of Large Scale Community Detection to Support Collaboration During Emergency Management,"INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR CRISIS RESPONSE AND MANAGEMENT IN MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES, ISCRAM-MED 2015",2015,2015,"During crisis situations, people often use social media to seek for help and to find new collaborators who can help them in emergency management.

"Language in Online Dating Texts: Trait Identification, Homophily, and their Effect on Attraction.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2015,2015,"Research has indicated that online daters may pick up on language cues connected to personality traits in online dating profile texts, and act upon those cues.

An online survey was conducted collecting the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) for each participant and text author, a peer-report TIPI score by participants for each text author, and an attractiveness rating on a Likert scale for each author. Participants correctly identified Extraversion, though the effect size was small. Contrary to the hypotheses, participants preferred texts when written by an author with a personality they perceived as dissimilar to their own, specifically in Openness and Conscientiousness, and no relationship was found between actual similarity of personality and attractiveness.

Social Media Activity and Hyperlink Network Analysis: A Holistic Media Ecology Perspective,2015 48TH HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES (HICSS),2015,2015,"This study examines a hyperlink network among non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in China. Using social media activity, indicated by the presence of a profile, length of time since social media adoption, number of accounts followed, and number of posts, we investigate NGOs' hyperlinking behaviors from a holistic media ecology perspective. Drawing from homophily and resource dependence theoiy, this research aims to understand NGOs' hyperlink networks from their social media activity. Four findings emerge from our study. First, hyperlink networks interact with social media activities. Second, hyperlink networks are shaped by both homophily and resource dependence. However, resource dependence theory better explains hyperlink networks. Third, in line with cohort effects, length of time since social media adoption matters for hyperlink network; early social media adopters were more likely to hyperlink to early adopters. Fourth, the number of posts is a better activity predictor for NGOs' hyperlink networks than number of accounts followed.",

Ethnic diversity and social capital in upward mobility systems Problematizing the permeability of intra-organizational career boundaries,CAREER DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL,2015,2015,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between ethnic diversity, social capital, and objective career success in upward mobility systems over time. The authors conceptualize the underlying process of why intra-organizational career boundaries are more permeable for dominant ethnics compared to minority ethnics.Design/methodology/approach - The authors conceptually explore and model this relationship by elaborating on three mechanisms of social capital return deficit proposed by Lin (2000), building the argument based on four underlying principles (stereotype fit, status construction, homophily, and reciprocity).Findings - Based on a proposed reciprocal relationship between social capital and objective career success, the authors suggest the development of an upward career spiral over time, which is continuously affected by ethnic group membership. Consequently, the authors argue that dominant ethnics do not only advance to a higher level of objective career success, but that they also advance exponentially faster than minority ethnics.Research limitations/implications - The conceptualization provokes the question to what extent the permeability of intra-organizational boundaries constrains careers of some, while enabling careers of others.Originality/value - The contribution lies in the exploration of the relationship between social capital and objective career success over time, of the permeability of intra-organizational career boundaries, and how both are affected by ethnic group membership.",
Community Based Information Dissemination,DATABASES THEORY AND APPLICATIONS,2015,2015,"Given a social network, we study the problem of finding k seeds that maximize the dissemination of information. Based on the principle of homophily, communities play an important role since information can be disseminated to communities via the seeds. We introduce a new mechanism for detecting communities satisfying the pertinent criteria for communities and information dissemination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by an application of the results for influence maximization.",
Relational sociology and culture: a preliminary framework,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE SOCIOLOGIE,2015,2015,"In this paper I outline a framework for a relational sociology of culture. I begin by briefly defining relational sociology and contrasting it with both individualistic and holistic alternatives. Culture, I suggest, is an inherently relational concept and needs to be theorised and analysed as such. This argument is briefly elaborated through a discussion of the generation and diffusion of culture by way of interaction and social networks. The respective contributions of Tarde, Durkheim, Merleau-Ponty, and Wittgenstein are given particular attention. In the final part of the paper I introduce and discuss Howard Becker's notion of 'art worlds', drawing out and elaborating upon its relational foundations whilst also further developing it through a more sustained reflection upon both the facilitative potential of social networks and their shaping, as hypothesised by Peter Blau (and developed by Miller McPherson and Noah Mark), by way of homophilic attraction in 'social space'. The paper covers a lot of ground and is intended as a sketch which subsequent work will fill out.",
Latent Factors Meet Homophily in Diffusion Modelling,"MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATABASES, ECML PKDD 2015, PT II",2015,2015,"Diffusion is an important dynamics that helps spreading information within an online social network. While there are already numerous models for single item diffusion, few have studied diffusion of multiple items, especially when items can interact with one another due to their inter-similarity. Moreover, the well-known homophily effect is rarely considered explicitly in the existing diffusion models. This work therefore fills this gap by proposing a novel model called Topic level Interaction Homophily Aware Diffusion (TIHAD) to include both latent factor level interaction among items and homophily factor in diffusion. The model determines item interaction based on latent factors and edge strengths based on homophily factor in the computation of social influence. An algorithm for training TIHAD model is also proposed. Our experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that: (a) homophily increases diffusion significantly, and (b) item interaction at topic level boosts diffusion among similar items. A case study on hashtag diffusion in Twitter also shows that TIHAD outperforms the baseline model in the hashtag adoption prediction task.",
A Study of the Social Relationships of Figure Skating instructors: Social Network Analysis,The Journal of Learner-Centered Curriculum and Instruction,2015,2015,"The purpose of this study was to examine the social relationships of figure skating instructors using social network analysis. A sample of 65 participants was selected via purposive sampling among instructors of Korean Figure Skating in 2014. Data were collected with a survey involving questions designed by the researchers about social relationships and social capital. Collected data were used to analyze the centrality and cohesiveness of close instructors and mentor instructors by using programs for social network analysis such as UCINET6, NetDraw, and PNet. Results revealed homophily via the instructors’ using the same ice rinks, originating from the same hometown, and being students under the same teacher, all of which strengthened social relationships among them. Instructors with high centrality possessed high social capital, often associated with the relationship between close instructors and mentor instructors. However, social relationships among instructors were also highly disconnected and closed. In sum, figure skating instructors have stronger social relationships due to homophily, yet show disconnected, closed relationships with instructors from other social relationships.",
Investigating Correlation Between Strength of Social Relationship and Interest Similarity,"COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS, CSONET 2015",2015,2015,"Recent years have seen exponential growth of microblog which provides users with a new communication and information sharing platform. Some recommendation approaches have been proposed by leveraging the social relationships in microblog based on the principle of homophily to improve the accuracy of recommendation. To prove the feasibility of users social relationships as the bases of recommendation in microblog, we investigate the correlation of strength of social relationship and user interest similarity in microblog by using real-world data set. We observe that strength of social relationship shows strong positive correlation with user interest similarity in microblog. We believe our investigation presents substantial impact for social recommendation research in microblog and will benefit future research in both recommender systems and other related social implications.",
Biased Respondent Group Selection Under Limited Budget for Minority Opinion Survey,"COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS, CSONET 2015",2015,2015,"This paper discusses a new approach to use the information from a special social network with high homophily to select a survey respondent group under a limited budget such that the result of the survey is biased to the minority opinions. This approach has a wide range of potential applications, e.g. collecting complaints from the customers of a new product while most of them are satisfied. We formally define the problem of computing such group with better utilization as the p-biased-representative selection problem (p-BRSP). This problem has two separate objectives and is difficult to deal with. Thus, we also propose a new unified-objective which is a function of the two optimization objectives. Most importantly, we introduce two polynomial time heuristic algorithms for the problem, where each of which has an approximation ratio with respect to each of the objectives.",
Predicting Smartphone Adoption in Social Networks,"ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, PART I",2015,2015,"The recent advancements in online social networks and mobile devices have provided valuable data sources to track users' smartphone adoption, i.e., the usage of smartphones over time. An incisive understanding of users' smartphone adoption can benefit many useful applications, ranging from user behavior understanding to targeted marketing. This paper studies smartphone adoption prediction in social networks by lever-aging the wisdom of an online world. A critical challenge along this line is to identify the key factors that underline people's adoption behaviors and distinguish the relative contribution of each factor. Specifically, we model the final smartphone status of each user as a result of three influencing factors: the social influence factor, the homophily factor, and the personal factor. We further develop a supervised model that takes all three factors for smartphone adoption and at the same time learns the relative contribution of each factor from the data. Experimental results on a large real world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",
Linearized and Single-Pass Belief Propagation,PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT,Jan 2015,2015,"How can we tell when accounts are fake or real in a social network? And how can we tell which accounts belong to liberal, conservative or centrist users? Often, we can answer such questions and label nodes in a network based on the labels of their neighbors and appropriate assumptions of homophily (""birds of a feather flock together"") or heterophily (""opposites attract""). One of the most widely used methods for this kind of inference is Belief Propagation (BP) which iteratively propagates the information from a few nodes with explicit labels throughout a network until convergence. A well-known problem with BP, however, is that there are no known exact guarantees of convergence in graphs with loops. This paper introduces Linearized Belief Propagation (LinBP), a linearization of BP that allows a closed-form solution via intuitive matrix equations and, thus, comes with exact convergence guarantees. It handles homophily, heterophily, and more general cases that arise in multi-class settings. Plus, it allows a compact implementation in SQL. The paper also introduces Single-pass Belief Propagation (SBP), a localized (or ""myopic"") version of LinBP that propagates information across every edge at most once and for which the final class assignments depend only on the nearest labeled neighbors. In addition, SBP allows fast incremental updates in dynamic networks. Our runtime experiments show that LinBP and SBP are orders of magnitude faster than standard BP, while leading to almost identical node labels.",
"An exploratory study of using 3D avatars as online salespeople The effect of avatar type on credibility, homophily, attractiveness and intention to interact",JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT,2015,2015,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine consumers' perceptions of using different types of 3D animated avatars as salespeople based on credibility, homophily, attractiveness and intention to interact.Design/methodology/approach - Using a survey method, participants (n = 120) evaluated four types of 3D animated avatars (i.e. human, fantasy, animal and humanoid) based on the supposition the avatars would represent a salesperson for an online retailer.Findings - The results show that avatar type has a significant influence on the perception of credibility, homophily, and attractiveness. Furthermore, credibility, homophily, and attractiveness significantly influence the intention to interact with the avatar. Overall, the human avatar was found to be perceived as the most credible, homophilous, attractive and was regarded as the highest in relation to intention to interact.Originality/value - The practical and theoretical implications are discussed to offer guidance to online retailers, graphic designers, and researchers in the benefits and pitfalls of utilizing 3D animated avatars as salespeople.",

Mediating Effects of Trust: Knowledge Sharing in a Large Professional Service Firm,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL (ECIC 2015),2015,2015,"Effective utilization of intellectual capital hinges on valuable information and knowledge being shared throughout the organization - knowledge of who to turn to for help, of best practices, of innovative solutions, or of lessons learned from less successful endeavours. However, many organizations face significant challenges in promoting effective information and knowledge sharing among employees and there is little evidence-based guidance from empirical research studies. Information and knowledge-sharing interactions are embedded in multifaceted social contexts, influenced by several different social and cognitive (human) factors. A better grasp of these complex factors is needed to help organizations build on past experiences, respond more efficiently to emerging problems, develop new ideas and insights, and avoid reinventing solutions or repeating prior mistakes. This paper extends the findings of a large empirical study of organizational knowledge sharing, which examined the interplay of several notable social and cognitive factors, including trust, shared language, shared vision, tie strength, homophily, and relationship length. Initial data analysis examined the direct, relative, and collective effects of social and cognitive factors on organizational knowledge sharing factors (Evans, 2012). The results showed co-worker trust as having the strongest statistical influence on each factor used to operationalize organizational knowledge sharing: willingness to share knowledge, willingness to use knowledge, and perceived receipt of useful information/knowledge (Evans, 2013). This paper presents the results of a secondary data analysis, which examines whether perceived trustworthiness in co-workers acts as a mediating variable between the previously mentioned social/cognitive variables and knowledge sharing factors. Data were collected from 275 knowledge workers (legal professionals and paralegals) engaged in shared legal project work, at one of Canada's largest multijurisdictional law firms. The nature of their work required a significant reliance on co-workers, across offices nationwide, for both explicit and tacit knowledge. The nature of projects allowed respondents to objectively evaluate the outcomes, gaining a better sense of the perceived effects of knowledge shared. A method outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986), which includes hierarchical multiple regression analysis, was used to test for the mediating effect of trust. This study is one of only few to measure the role trust plays in mediating the relationship between different social/cognitive factors and knowledge sharing. Previous studies have examined this effect with far fewer factors, or with a much less inclusive conceptualization of knowledge sharing. The results show that, when perceived trustworthiness was high in the referent co-worker, there was less need for the respondent and the co-worker to have a shared vision. Alternatively, when there was less trust between co-workers, shared vision was required for them to participate in effective knowledge sharing. Trust also had a mediating effect between shared language and knowledge sharing, but only in relationships between respondents and co-workers they felt they worked well with.",
Friends and fellow travelers: comparative influence of review sites and friends on hotel choice,JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM TECHNOLOGY,2015,2015,"Purpose - This paper aims to examine when travelers are more influenced by friends (word-of-mouth [WOM]) with limited knowledge of hotels but an understanding of the traveler, and when by review sites (electronic word-of-mouth [eWOM]) which have immense experience of hotels but cannot know the individual traveler. Sites such as TripAdvisor roffer millions of reviews, and travelers often reduce that to a manageable amount by focusing on reviews by writers who show homophily, i.e. are similar to them in terms of travel interests. These sites represent a form of eWOM recommendation; what is not clear is how much they replace or augment traditional WOM.Design/methodology/approach - Dual-method content analysis of semi-structured interviews with a heterogeneous purposive sample of regular users of TripAdvisor ( N = 30), followed by a survey of TripAdvisor users (N = 237).Findings - Friends were considered the most credible information source, although friends showing greater homophily were more valued than others. However, in some circumstances, subjects found eWOMmore credible: when they wanted greater certainty in their hotel choice, so complete information was important; when the hotel was for a special occasion or special people; and for feelings of empowerment. Most subjects compared all sources rather than relying on one.Originality/value - This study reminds hotel managers that while eWOM is accessible and analyzable, it may not fully represent guests' opinions; hotels' marketing strategy should balance it with other recommendation networks. As guests compare sources, consistency in all forms of customer engagement is also essential.",
Dynamics of on-off Intermedia Agenda Sharing: The Election of Superintendent of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education,Korean Journal of Communication Studies,2015,2015,"The purpose of this study is to examine the process and the effects of the intermedia dynamics by way of approaching four factors such as homophily, codependence, agenda- sharing and agenda-bombing. In order to reach this purpose, various data from the social media(Facebook and Twitter), a internet news site and a newspaper are collected and comparatively analysed. Results showed that intermedia agenda-sharing was being dynamically and mutually activated as the use of internet news and SNS rapidly spread. Such phenomenon implies that agenda monopoly dominated by traditional media has passed by. As a certain issue initiated by a Facebook post is recognized as salient, the internet news site and the newspaper have driven the issue to make an agenda in which interactivity and convergence powerfully occurs. The result also indicated that the so-called 'triangle combination' of SNS-internet news-newspaper triggered the informational cascades and generated agenda-bombing which made deep impacts on the result of the election. It is expected that this study would contribute to explore collaborative journalism leading to agenda-bombing of social issue.",
Leveraging social influence to address overweight and obesity using agent-based models: The role of adolescent social networks,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Jan 2015,2015,"The prevalence of adolescent overweight and obesity (hereafter, simply ""overweight"") in the US has increased over the past several decades. Individually-targeted prevention and treatment strategies targeting individuals have been disappointing, leading some to propose leveraging social networks to improve interventions. We hypothesized that social network dynamics (social marginalization; homophily on body mass index, BMI) and the strength of peer influence would increase or decrease the proportion of network member (agents) becoming overweight over a simulated year, and that peer influence would operate differently in social networks with greater overweight. We built an agent-based model (ABM) using results from R-SIENA. ABMs allow for the exploration of potential interventions using simulated agents. Initial model specifications were drawn from Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We focused on a single saturation school with complete network and BMI data over two waves (n = 624). The model was validated against empirical observations at Wave 2. We focused on overall overweight prevalence after a simulated year. Five experiments were conducted: (1) changing attractiveness of high-BMI agents; (2) changing homophily on BMI; (3) changing the strength of peer influence; (4) shifting the overall BMI distribution; and (5) targeting dietary interventions to highly connected individuals. Increasing peer influence showed a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of overweight; making peer influence negative (i.e., doing the opposite of friends) increased overweight. However, the effect of peer influence varied based on the underlying distribution of BMI; when BMI was increased overall, stronger peer influence increased proportion of overweight. Other interventions, including targeted dieting, had little impact. Peer influence may be a viable target in overweight interventions, but the distribution of body size in the population needs to be taken into account. In low-obesity populations, strengthening peer influence may be a useful strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
"Alike people, alike interests? Inferring interest similarity in online social networks",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Jan 2015,2015,"Understanding how much two individuals are alike in their interests (i.e., interest similarity) has become virtually essential for many applications and services in Online Social Networks (OSNs). Since users do not always explicitly elaborate their interests in OSNs like Facebook, how to determine users' interest similarity without fully knowing their interests is a practical problem. In this paper, we investigate how users' interest similarity relates to various social features (e.g. geographic distance); and accordingly infer whether the interests of two users are alike or unalike where one of the users' interests are unknown. Relying on a large Facebook dataset, which contains 479,048 users and 5,263,351 user-generated interests, we present comprehensive empirical studies and verify the homophily of interest similarity across three interest domains (movies, music and TV shows). The homophily reveals that people tend to exhibit more similar tastes if they have similar demographic information (e.g., age, location), or if they are friends. It also shows that the individuals with a higher interest entropy usually share more interests with others. Based on these results, we provide a practical prediction model under a real OSN environment. For a given user with no interest information, this model can select some individuals who not only exhibit many interests but also probably achieve high interest similarities with the given user. Eventually, we illustrate a use case to demonstrate that the proposed prediction model could facilitate decision-making for OSN applications and services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Choosing your network: Social preferences in an online health community,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Jan 2015,2015,"A growing number of online health communities offer individuals the opportunity to receive information, advice, and support from peers. Recent studies have demonstrated that these new online contacts can be important informational resources, and can even exert significant influence on individuals' behavior in various contexts. However little is known about how people select their health contacts in these virtual domains. This is because selection preferences in peer networks are notoriously difficult to detect. In existing networks, unobserved pressures on tie formation such as common organizational memberships, introductions to friends of friends, or limitations on accessibility may mistakenly be interpreted as individual preferences for interacting/not interacting with others. We address these issues by adopting a social media approach to studying network formation. We study social selection using an in vivo study within an online exercise program, in which anonymous participants have equal opportunities for initiating relationships with other program members. This design allows us to identify individuals' preferences for health contacts, and to evaluate what these preferences imply for members' access to new kinds of health information, and for the kinds of social influences to which they are exposed. The study was conducted within a goal-oriented fitness competition, in which participation was greatest among a small core of active individuals. Our results show that the active participants displayed indifference to the fitness and exercise profiles of others, disregarding information about others' fitness levels, exercise preferences, and workout experiences, instead selecting partners almost entirely on the basis of similarities on gender, age, and BMI. Interestingly, the findings suggest that rather than expanding and diversifying their sources of health information, participants' choices limited the value of their online resources by selecting contacts based on characteristics that are common sources of homophily in offline relationships. In light of our findings, we discuss design principles that may be useful for organizations and policy makers trying to improve the value of participants' social capital within online health programs.

"Siblings, friends, course-mates, club-mates: How adolescent health behavior homophily varies by race, class, gender, and health status",SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Jan 2015,2015,"Many unhealthy behaviors develop during adolescence, and these behaviors can have fundamental consequences for health and mortality in adulthood. Social network structure and the degree of homophily in a network affect how health behaviors and innovations are spread. However, the degree of health behavior homophily across different social ties and within subpopulations is unknown. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by using a novel regression model to document the degree of homophily across various relationship types and subpopulations for behaviors of interest that are related to health outcomes. These patterns in health behavior homophily have implications for which behaviors and ties should be the subjects of future research and for predicting how homophily may shape health programs focused on specific subpopulations (gender, race, class, health status) or a specific social context (families, peer groups, classrooms, or school activities).

Reprint of: Results from using a new dyadic-dependence model to analyze sociocentric physician networks,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Jan 2015,2015,"Professional physician networks can potentially influence clinical practices and quality of care. With the current focus on coordinated care, discerning influences of naturally occurring clusters and other forms of dependence among physicians' relationships based on their attributes and care patterns is an important area of research. In this paper, two directed physician networks: a physician influential conversation network (N = 33) and a physician network obtained from patient visit data (N = 135) are analyzed using a new model that accounts for effect modification of the within-dyad effect of reciprocity and inter-dyad effects involving three (or more) actors. The results from this model include more nuanced effects involving reciprocity and triadic dependence than under incumbent models and more flexible control for these effects in the extraction of other network phenomena, including the relationship between similarity of individuals' attributes (e.g., same-gender, same residency location) and tie-status. In both cases we find extensive evidence of clustering and triadic dependence that if not accounted for confounds the effect of reciprocity and attribute homophily. Findings from our analysis suggest alternative conclusions to those from incumbent models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Bridging the gap: the roles of social capital and ethnicity in medical student achievement,MEDICAL EDUCATION,Jan 2015,2015,"ObjectivesWithin medical education, there is a discrepancy between the achievement level of White students and that of their ethnic minority peers. The processes underlying this disparity have not been adequately investigated or explained. This study utilises social network analysis to investigate the impact of relationships on medical student achievement by ethnicity, specifically by examining homophily (the tendency to interact with others in the same group) by ethnicity, age and role.MethodsData from a cross-sectional social network study conducted in one UK medical school are presented and are analysed alongside examination records obtained from the medical school. Participants were sampled across the four hospital placement sites; a total of 158 medical students in their clinical phase (Years 3 and 4) completed the survey. The research was designed and analysed using social capital theory.ResultsAlthough significant patterns of ethnic and religious homophily emerged, no link was found between these factors and achievement. Interacting with problem-based learning (PBL) group peers in study-related activities, and having seniors in a wider academic support network were directly linked to better achievement. Students in higher academic quartiles were more likely to be named by members of their PBL group in study activities and to name at least one tutor or clinician in their network. Students from lower-achieving groups were least likely to have the social capital enabling, and resulting from, interactions with members of more expert social groups.ConclusionsLower levels of the social capital that mediates interaction with peers, tutors and clinicians may be the cause of underperformance by ethnic minority students. Because of ethnic homophily, minority students may be cut off from potential and actual resources that facilitate learning and achievement.Discuss ideas arising from the article at discuss.",
"Why does everybody hate me? Balance, status, and homophily: The triumvirate of signed tie formation",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2015,2015,"Despite being one of the foundational theories of signed (positive/negative) tie formation, the evidence for balance theory is far from conclusive. A recent promising alternative is status theory, but a theoretical and explanatory gap still remains, with a dearth of theories and evidence. We put forward and test eight separate theories of signed tie formation on two face-to-face networks of friendship and esteem of 282 students. We use dimension reduction (factor analysis) on the results tables comparing the predictions of these eight theories for 50 ERGM parameters with our estimated models. We find three main paradigms explain the majority of signed network formation: balance, status, and homophily. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Immigrant children and their parents: Is there an intergenerational interdependence of integration into social networks?,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2015,2015,"The paper investigates the integration of immigrant children and their parents in different dimensions of social networks - referred to as multiplexity in social network terminology. These dimensions are children's friendships, their attendance at birthday parties, and contact among their parents. By attending birthday parties, children's friendships are publicly reinforced and membership in a social circle is signified. During these events, communication and social exchange drive the process of social integration at the micro-level, and ethnic boundaries can be shifted or blurred. It will be shown that a variety of homophily effects can be found in all three network dimensions. In addition, ethnic segregation in parents' networks has an impact on children's participation in these events and, thereby, on children's integration in social networks. However, the causal effect in the other way around - children's birthday party attendance on contact among their parents - is even stronger. A new approach is the non-recursive analysis of how ties in one network dimension effect ties in another dimension. Analyses are based on 76 social networks of 1266 children in school classes in the city state of Bremen, Germany. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
"Asian ethnicity in the West: preference for Chinese, Indian and Korean service staff",ASIAN ETHNICITY,2015,2015,"The emergence of ethnic markets has been rapid following the growing trend of intra-national diversity in developed nations. These new markets have attracted researchers to investigate the role of ethnicity in consumer behaviour; however, to date, literature has focused on the role of the origin of tangible goods/products. In contrast, ethnic marketing for services has gained little attention. This study fills this gap by investigating the effect of ethnicity of service staff on consumers' preferences for services. These effects are tested for the four service types identified in Lovelock's service classification scheme. This study examined consumers' preferences in services based on the ethnicity/racial category of service staff (Caucasian, Chinese, Indian and Korean) and service type (Medical, Education, Financial and Cleaning). A shopping mall intercept survey included a sample of 471. Multivariate analysis of variance was applied to test for significant variances between the mean preferences. Significant differences in preferences for the ethnicity of service staff were empirically established. Consumers, regardless of their ethnicity, prefer service staff of the same ethnicity. This creates a gap between preferences for one's own ethnicity and preferences for others. This tendency was especially strong in medical services. Consumers' preferences for service staff ethnicity are explained by the theories of country of origin, animosity, homophily and language. This study encourages service providers to make use of ethnic marketing, since a better match between service staff and customers' preferences results in less miscommunication and better cultural understanding. Training on cultural sensitivity is also encouraged. This study establishes the important role of the country of origin in services. We name this the 'country of origin of service staff (COSS)' effect.",
The Intergroup Perspective in the Classroom: An Examination of Group-Based Categorization and Relational Outcomes Between Students and Teachers,COMMUNICATION RESEARCH REPORTS,2015,2015,"This brief report highlights a study that applied the intergroup perspective to the instructional context in order to examine the ways in which group-based categorization (i.e., attitude homophily, background homophily, and global shared social identity) related to satisfaction and affect in the educational context. The results demonstrated that all three group-based categorizers were positively related to student-teacher relational satisfaction, student communication satisfaction with their teachers, and affect for teachers; yet attitude homophily emerged as the strongest contributor to feelings of shared identity.",

The effects of friendship and antipathy networks on adolescent attitude similarity,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH,2015,2015,"Friendship is seen as an important factor in influencing the peer-to-peer social relationships and attitudes during their adolescence. However, few researchers observe adolescents' antipathy networks and study the extent to which such negative relationship influences adolescents' behaviours and attitudes. In this study, I use social network analysis to estimate the influence of friendship and antipathy between adolescents by calculating Euclidean distance in network structure and compare the distance effects of these two opposite forces on their attitude similarity. The preliminary findings show that friends do not necessarily have similar attitudes towards any dimensions of life experience, but strong friendship networks provide significant support for adolescents' emotional stability, while antipathy networks enhance the tension and conflict between peer foes because of their similar attitudes on the strong sense of ego. This result implies that friends' similarity is not as significant as studies have overwhelmingly shown as prior studies argue. Friends' and foes' similarity could be associated with the friendship and antipathy networks only by understanding the context of the interaction.",
Quantifying Partisan Selective Exposure Through Network Text Analysis of Elite Political Blog Networks During the U.S. 2012 Presidential Election,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS,2015,2015,"Utilizing network-based content analysis methodologies, this study examined 316,594 hyperlinks and 60,378 headlines culled from 20 elite, partisan political blogs through 10 months of the U.S. 2012 presidential year for evidence of partisan selective exposure in blog production practices. Hyperlinks reveal dense intra-interconnectivity among progressive blogs as opposed to conservative blogs. Elite, traditional media sources operated as bridges between spheres that otherwise tended to partisan selective exposure in their partisan source linking practices toward congenial media. Headline network text analysis revealed divergent issue and people agendas promoted between both partisan blog networks, providing very strong evidence for the operation of partisan selective exposure in the emergent content practices of these elite produser publics across the 2012 U.S. presidential year.",

We assume that a combination of Social Network Analysis and Machine Learning can help to achieve deeper understanding and to find patterns which are hidden from the one-side analysis. For the research, we gathered information about transfers of Dota 2 teams made between The Internationals of 2016 and 2017 and built a network based on this data. For the ERGM, we checked the importance of belonging to one region and organization, difference of skills, and participation in TI, and for association rules, on a par with the regions, we added players roles, and a metric of their personal performance - fantasy points. Summing up the results, we found out the importance of homophily within regions, detected presence of vertical mobility, and discover the influence of the specific players roles.",
Effect of relationships in Social Networks on calculating user sentiment profiles,NEW TRENDS ON SYSTEM SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING,2015,2015,"In Social Networks there is a trend for people of similar interests to associate with each other. Such a tendency is called homophily, and in this paper we study the effect it has on calculating user sentiment profiles. We collect Twitter data such as tweets and follower relationships, and we use that to calculate initial user profiles (topic sentiments) and user connectivity. The novel approach in this paper is in the way user sentiment is calculated by using the impact of the related users. This impact related users have on one another depends on the connectivity factor between two people. We show that applying such an approach, which utilizes user connectivity when calculating user profiles, leads to better accuracy and we also show that there are indications it might help in tackling the cold start problem.",

In order to build a population, community, or single-user Twixonomy we first associate ""topical"" friends in users' friendship lists (i.e. friends representing an interest rather than a social relation between peers) withWikipedia categories. A word-sense disambiguation algorithm is used to select the appropriate wikipage for each topical friend. Starting from the set of wikipages representing ""primitive"" interests, we extract all paths connecting these pages with topmost Wikipedia category nodes, and we then prune the resulting graph G efficiently so as to induce a direct acyclic graph. This graph is the Twixonomy. Then, to analyze homophily, we compare different methods to detect communities in a peer friends Twitter network, and then for each community we compute the degree of homophily on the basis of a measure of pairwise semantic similarity. We show that the Twixonomy provides a means for describing users' interests in a compact and readable way and allows for a fine-grained homophily analysis. Furthermore, we show that mid-low level categories in the Twixonomy represent the best balance between informativeness and compactness of the representation.",
PEER INFLUENCE IN THE DIFFUSION OF IPHONE 3G OVER A LARGE SOCIAL NETWORK,MIS QUARTERLY,Dec 2014,2014,"In this paper, we study the effect of peer influence in the diffusion of the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled from a large dataset provided by a major European Mobile carrier in one country. We identify tight communities of users in which peer influence may play a role and use instrumental variables to control for potential correlation between unobserved subscriber heterogeneity and friends' adoption. We provide evidence that the propensity of a subscriber to adopt increases with the percentage of friends who have already adopted. During a period of 11 months, we estimate that 14 percent of iPhone 3Gs sold by this carrier were due to peer influence. This result is obtained after controlling for social clustering, gender, previous adoption of mobile Internet data plans, ownership of technologically advanced handsets, and heterogeneity in the regions where subscribers move during the day and spend most of their evenings. This result remains qualitatively unchanged when we control for changes over time in the structure of the social network. We provide results from several policy experiments showing that, with this level of effect of peer influence, the carrier would have hardly benefitted from using traditional marketing strategies to seed the iPhone 3G to benefit from viral marketing.",
Cohesive subgroups in the international collaboration network in astronomy and astrophysics,SCIENTOMETRICS,Dec 2014,2014,"This study employs social network analysis to identify institutions with strong international collaborative relationships in astronomical research. We find that the strongest ties tend to link institutions across continents in research collaboration. However, the effect of geographic factors is still notable in light of the fact that most of the institutions in the largest subgroup are located in Europe. Examination of the network position, measured by degree centrality, indicates that homophily is more common than heterophily in the network. A relatively high number of relational ties are observed among institutions that have similar levels of network centrality. Mutual relations are prevalent among central institutions, while strong mutual solidarity exists between institutions on the periphery of the network. This study shows a general unstable international collaborative relationship among astronomical institutions. While more and more institutions have linked up in research collaboration, many of them keep relatively weak ties. Institutions tend not remain in the same subgroup, but link to different partners over time.",
Network Ecology and Adolescent Social Structure,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Dec 2014,2014,"Adolescent societieswhether arising from weak, short-term classroom friendships or from close, long-term friendshipsexhibit various levels of network clustering, segregation, and hierarchy. Some are rank-ordered caste systems and others are flat, cliquish worlds. Explaining the source of such structural variation remains a challenge, however, because global network features are generally treated as the agglomeration of micro-level tie-formation mechanisms, namely balance, homophily, and dominance. How do the same micro-mechanisms generate significant variation in global network structures? To answer this question we propose and test a network ecological theory that specifies the ways features of organizational environments moderate the expression of tie-formation processes, thereby generating variability in global network structures across settings. We develop this argument using longitudinal friendship data on schools (Add Health study) and classrooms (Classroom Engagement study), and by extending exponential random graph models to the study of multiple societies over time.",
Identity-based learning and segregation in social networks under different institutional environments,COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ORGANIZATION THEORY,Dec 2014,2014,"To study the evolution of segregation in social networks across systems embedded in different institutional environments, we develop an identity-based learning model where segregation is stochastically conditioned by the initial distribution of the actor's attention to identity and the updating of this distribution over time. The updating process, which we call the process of mutual learning multiplier, is based on an actor's success and failure experiences in tying with the same-subgroup and cross-subgroup actors. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation of the model show that the mutual learning multiplier produces disproportional relationships between the initial distribution of identity attention and the level of segregation in social networks. We also find that those relationships are affected by the actors' attention to structural holes, rate of learning from experience, system size, and the identity heterogeneity of the system. Overall, the model provides insights into various dynamics of network structuration across time and space.",
Dissecting the Human Protein-Protein Interaction Network via Phylogenetic Decomposition,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Nov 21 2014,2014,"The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network offers a conceptual framework for better understanding the functional organization of the proteome. However, the intricacy of network complexity complicates comprehensive analysis. Here, we adopted a phylogenic grouping method combined with force-directed graph simulation to decompose the human PPI network in a multi-dimensional manner. This network model enabled us to associate the network topological properties with evolutionary and biological implications. First, we found that ancient proteins occupy the core of the network, whereas young proteins tend to reside on the periphery. Second, the presence of age homophily suggests a possible selection pressure may have acted on the duplication and divergence process during the PPI network evolution. Lastly, functional analysis revealed that each age group possesses high specificity of enriched biological processes and pathway engagements, which could correspond to their evolutionary roles in eukaryotic cells. More interestingly, the network landscape closely coincides with the subcellular localization of proteins. Together, these findings suggest the potential of using conceptual frameworks to mimic the true functional organization in a living cell.",
Fragmented Romanian Sociology: Growth and Structure of the Collaboration Network,PLOS ONE,Nov 19 2014,2014,"Structural patterns in collaboration networks are essential for understanding how new ideas, research practices, innovation or cooperation circulate and develop within academic communities and between and within university departments. In our research, we explore and investigate the structure of the collaboration network formed by the academics working full-time within all the 17 sociology departments across Romania. We show that the collaboration network is sparse and fragmented, and that it constitutes an environment that does not promote the circulation of new ideas and innovation within the field. Although recent years have witnessed an increase in the productivity of Romanian sociologists, there is still ample room for improvement in terms of the interaction infrastructure that ought to link individuals together so that they could maximize their potentials. We also fail to discern evidence in favor of the Matthew effect governing the growth of the network, which suggests scientific success and productivity are not rewarded. Instead, the structural properties of the collaboration network are partly those of a core-periphery network, where the spread of innovation and change can be explained by structural equivalence rather than by interpersonal influence models. We also provide support for the idea that, within the observed network, collaboration is the product of homophily rather than prestige effects. Further research on the subject based on data from other countries in the region is needed to place our results in a comparative framework, in particular to discern whether the behavior of the Romanian sociologist community is unique or rather common.",
Individual attributes and self-organizational processes affect dominance network structure in pukeko,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,NOV-DEC 2014,2014,"Who's the boss? Dominance relationships in a group-living bird depend on individual attributes and other social relationships. In the pukeko, group-mates form dominance relationships with one another that determine access to resources. We show that the amount of aggression and submission that occurs among group-mates is determined by the characteristics of the individuals. However, pukeko groups also self-organize into linear dominance hierarchies, which may help their groups to function as a coordinated unit.Dominance relationships are an important type of social relationship that can influence group dynamics and individual fitness. However, most studies on dominance have been restricted to investigating the orderliness of dominance hierarchies and how individual traits influence dominance rank. Here, we used a social network approach to investigate the patterns and quality of dominance interactions in the pukeko, a cooperatively breeding bird that lives in stable, mixed-sex social groups. By using a combination of modern statistical techniques, including one of the first applications of exponential random graph models in behavioral ecology, we show that pukeko dominance networks emerge from both the attributes of individuals, as well as from endogenous, self-organization of dominance relationships (i.e., structural dependence). Pukeko dominance networks were influenced by sexual differences in dominance interactions, sexual homophily, characteristics of status signals, and a tendency to form transitive triad motifs. These factors have differential effects on submissive and aggressive behaviors but ultimately lead to the formation of orderly and highly asymmetrical dominance hierarchies that are temporally stable. This study demonstrates the utility of multivariate statistical tools for network analysis of animal societies and provides a rich understanding of the factors that influence dominance interactions in this interesting species.",
Emergence of clustering in an acquaintance model without homophily,JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT,Nov 2014,2014,"We introduce an agent-based acquaintance model in which social links are created by processes in which there is no explicit homophily. In spite of the homogeneous nature of the social interactions, highly-clustered social networks can arise. The crucial feature of our model is that of variable transitive interactions. Namely, when an agent introduces two unconnected friends, the rate at which a connection actually occurs between them depends on the number of their mutual acquaintances. As this transitive interaction rate is varied, the social network undergoes a dramatic clustering transition. Close to the transition, the network consists of a collection of well-defined communities. As a function of time, the network can also undergo an incomplete gelation transition, in which the gel, or giant cluster, does not constitute the entire network, even at infinite time. Some of the clustering properties of our model also arise, but in a more gradual manner, in Facebook networks. Finally, we discuss a more realistic variant of our original model in which network realizations can be constructed that quantitatively match Facebook networks.",
Too close for comfort? Geographic propinquity to political power and stock returns,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,Nov 2014,2014,"We show that firm headquarters' geographic proximity to political power centers (state capitals) is associated with higher abnormal returns. Consistent with the notion that this effect is rooted in social network links, we find it is more pronounced in communities with high levels of sociability and political values' homophily, and that it dissipates when firms move their headquarters to another state. Finally, in line with the view, that investors perceive such networks to be associated with political risk, we find that this effect is particularly strong when there are substantial levels of corruption, dependency on government spending, and politicians' turnover.

Inclusion and homophily: an argument about participatory decision-making and democratic school management,BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES,Oct 2 2014,2014,"This paper reports findings from a study about school staff's perceptions of the preferences for social interaction that young people have with similar and different others. This tension was explored empirically using scenarios of moral dilemmas to conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with school staff from special and mainstream secondary schools. The issue was explored with reference to a tension between social inclusion, the principle of embracing difference, and homophily, the concept that similarity breeds connection. The data suggest that homophily and inclusion can come into a tension with an ethical dimension. In education, the homophily/inclusion tension is one between students' preferences for being among similar others and the moral imperative of including everybody; or between individuality and commonality. Inclusion is often translated into a demand for full participation as the only way to respond ethically to difference. However, the recognition of students' rights to negotiate their preferences, even when they come into tension with what is considered to be politically correct, is also an ethical position. The paper concludes that the homophily/inclusion tension is constructive as it challenges the moral necessity of inclusion for all, and opens a debate about participatory decision-making and democratic school management.",
Occupational mismatch and social networks,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,Oct 2014,2014,"A labor market model with heterogeneous workers and jobs is provided to investigate the effects of social networks as a job information channel regarding the level of mismatch between workers and firms. The efficiency in producing good matches of the formal market is compared to that of social networks. It is assumed that links between workers represent favoring relationships: workers recommend each other for any kinds of jobs, regardless of the quality of the resulting match. This study shows that as the fraction of ties connecting similar agents (homophily) increases, the level of mismatch decreases. If this fraction is sufficiently high, networks provide good matches at a higher rate than the formal market, for any efficiency level of the market. In this case, the mismatch level is lower in economies with social networks than it would be if workers did not use social contacts for job search. Hence, the presence of social networks can reduce mismatch despite favoritism. Implications of mismatch creation for the expected wages of jobs obtainable through different search methods are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Avatar-driven self-disclosure: The virtual me is the actual me,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Oct 2014,2014,"Considering the importance of self-clisclosure in building relationships and bonds, it is vital to investigate how self-disclosure is affected by avatars utilized in many online communities. In this study, we tested a research model that explores how perceived avatar-self similarity affects self-disclosure via different theoretical constructs such as self-awareness, self-presence, and identifiability. The research model was empirically tested with data from a web-based survey of 209 Second Life users. Results revealed that avatar similarity impacts self-disclosure but with varying effects, depending on how it is mediated by variables of identifiability, self-awareness and self-presence. Specifically, appearance similarity affects homophily, which heightens self-awareness. This results in increased feelings of self-presence, which positively affects self-disclosure. Homophily also has the effect of heightening perceptions of identifiability, which decreases self-disclosure. Implications and applications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Do colleagues influence our lifestyle: The matter of smoking, body mass index and leisure-time physical activity?",PREVENTIVE MEDICINE,Oct 2014,2014,"Objective: Previous research has indicated that health behaviours tend to cluster in social networks, but few have studied the cluster effect in workgroups. We examined the effect of workgroups on current state and change in three indicators of health behaviours (smoking, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity). Further, we examined whether health behaviours of the respondents at group level predicted lifestyle changes.Methods: In a prospective cohort (n = 4730), employees from 250 workgroups in the Danish eldercare sector answered questionnaires at baseline (2005) and follow-up (2006). Multilevel regression models were used to examine the effect of workgroups.Results: Workgroups accounted for 6.49% of the variation in smoking status, 6.56% of amount smoked and 2.62% of the variation in current BMI. We found no significant workgroup clustering in physical activity or lifestyle changes. Furthermore, changes in smoking status (cessation) and weight gain were seen in workgroups with high percentage of smokers and high levels of BMI.Conclusion: We found modest evidence for clustering of some health behaviours within workgroups, which could be due to social learning or selection into and out of workgroups. Future health promotion programmes at worksites should recognize the potential clustering of lifestyle behaviours within workgroups. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

"CORRELATED EQUILIBRIUM, CONFORMITY, AND STEREOTYPING IN SOCIAL GROUPS",JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMIC THEORY,Oct 2014,2014,"We argue that a social norm and the coordination of behavior within social groups can be expressed by a correlated equilibrium. Given a social group structure (a partition of individuals into social groups), we propose four conditions that one may expect of a correlated equilibrium consistent with social norms. These are: (1) within-group anonymity (conformity within groups), (2) group independence (no conformity between groups), (3) homophily (individuals in the same group have similar attributes), and (4) predictable group behavior (ex post stability). We demonstrate that correlated equilibrium satisfying (1)-(3) exist very generally and equilibrium satisfying (1)-(4) exist in games with many players. We also consider stereotyped beliefs-beliefs that all individuals in a social group can be expected to behave in the same way-and show that stereotyping is not costly to the person who stereotypes but may or may not be beneficial to society.",
Respondent driven sampling is an effective method for engaging methamphetamine users in HIV prevention research in South Africa,DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE,Oct 1 2014,2014,"Background: South Africa, in the midst of the world's largest HIV epidemic, has a growing methamphetamine problem. Respondent driven sampling (RDS) is a useful tool for recruiting hard-to-reach populations in HIV prevention research, but its use with methamphetamine smokers in South Africa has not been described. This study examined the effectiveness of RDS as a method for engaging methamphetamine users in a Cape Town township into HIV behavioral research.Methods: Standard RDS procedures were used to recruit active methamphetamine smokers from a racially diverse pen-urban township in Cape Town. Effectiveness of RDS was determined by examining social network characteristics (network size, homophily, and equilibrium) of recruited participants.Results: Beginning with eight seeds, 345 methamphetamine users were enrolled over 6 months, with a coupon return rate of 67%. The sample included 197 men and 148 women who were racially diverse (73% Coloured, 27% Black African) and had a mean age of 28.8 years (SD = 7.2). Social networks were adequate (mean network size >5) and mainly comprised of close social ties. Equilibrium on race was reached after 11 waves of recruitment, and after <= 3 waves for all other variables of interest. There was little to moderate preference for either in- or out-group recruiting in all subgroups.Conclusions: Results suggest that RDS is an effective method for engaging methamphetamine users into HIV prevention research in South Africa. Additionally, RDS may be a useful strategy for seeking high-risk methamphetamine users for HIV testing and linkage to HIV care in this and other low resource settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The Evolution of Social Ties Online: A Longitudinal Study in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Oct 2014,2014,"How do social ties in online worlds evolve over time? This research examined the dynamic processes of relationship formation, maintenance, and demise in a massively multiplayer online game. Drawing from evolutionary and ecological theories of social networks, this study focuses on the impact of three sets of evolutionary factors in the context of social relationships in the online game EverQuest II (EQII): the aging and maturation processes, social architecture of the game, and homophily and proximity. A longitudinal analysis of tie persistence and decay demonstrated the transient nature of social relationships in EQII, but ties became considerably more durable over time. Also, character level similarity, shared guild membership, and geographic proximity were powerful mechanisms in preserving social relationships.",
Assortative mating on risk attitude,THEORY AND DECISION,Oct 2014,2014,"Spousal correlation in risk attitude is estimated using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel over the period 2004-2009. We apply the bivariate panel ordered probit model to the analysis of the simultaneous determination of the male's and the female's risk attitude, using the survey question about general willingness to take risk, provided on a 0-10 Likert-scale. The correlations between both the individual-specific effects of the two partners and the two within-individual errors are separately estimated, and found to be +0.285 and +0.310, respectively. We consider the former to be a key parameter, since its positive sign may be interpreted in terms of positive assortative mating on risk attitude: individuals tend to form partnerships with others having a similar risk attitude. We also find evidence that this correlation increases with years of marriage, suggesting either a form of spousal socialization or a selection process in which marriage breakdown is more likely in poorly matched couples.",
Measuring segregation in social networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2014,2014,"Network homophily is a pattern in which ties are more likely to exist between nodes similar to each other. It is frequently observed for various types of social relations. At the same time, segregation is often encountered in urban areas as a tendency of families to occupy neighborhoods inhabited by other families similar to them. In this paper we conceptualize both phenomena as in the language of networks of interlinked positions occupied by a population of actors characterized by some node-level attribute. We review existing indexes and approaches to measuring the extent of homophily/segregation in social networks. We pursue an approach of, first, specifying a set of properties that a generic segregation measure might possess, and which, in our view, are relevant in substantial contexts. Second, we check which measures satisfy which properties. The use of measures is illustrated with four empirical examples. Given the particular application and the need for some descriptive measure of segregation, the results presented in this paper can help in selecting an optimal measure for the task at hand. We conclude that the most crucial aspects for the choice of a particular segregation measure include (1) whether the network ties or actors' attributes are assumed to be subject to change, and (2) how one should treat the presence of network isolates.

"Ethnic ingroup friendships in schools: Testing the by-product hypothesis in England, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2014,2014,"This study set out to examine to what extent ethnic ingroup friendship in secondary school classes are a by-product of cultural and socioeconomic ingroup friendship. Based on homophily theory, we expected similar opinions, leisure activities, religion, risk behaviour and socioeconomic factors to (partly) explain ethnic ingroup preferences. Multilevel p(2) models on 13,272 pupils in 625 secondary school classes in England, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden showed that adolescents tend to have friends similar in ethnicity, cultural and socioeconomic characteristics. We find no evidence, however, that ethnic homophily is explained by cultural and socioeconomic homophily. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
The Matthew effect in empirical data,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE,Sep 6 2014,2014,"The Matthew effect describes the phenomenon that in societies, the rich tend to get richer and the potent even more powerful. It is closely related to the concept of preferential attachment in network science, where the more connected nodes are destined to acquire many more links in the future than the auxiliary nodes. Cumulative advantage and success-breads-success also both describe the fact that advantage tends to beget further advantage. The concept is behind the many power laws and scaling behaviour in empirical data, and it is at the heart of self-organization across social and natural sciences. Here, we review the methodology for measuring preferential attachment in empirical data, as well as the observations of the Matthew effect in patterns of scientific collaboration, socio-technical and biological networks, the propagation of citations, the emergence of scientific progress and impact, career longevity, the evolution of common English words and phrases, as well as in education and brain development. We also discuss whether the Matthew effect is due to chance or optimization, for example related to homophily in social systems or efficacy in technological systems, and we outline possible directions for future research.",
Estimating Peer Effects in Longitudinal Dyadic Data Using Instrumental Variables,BIOMETRICS,Sep 2014,2014,"The identification of causal peer effects (also known as social contagion or induction) from observational data in social networks is challenged by two distinct sources of bias: latent homophily and unobserved confounding. In this paper, we investigate how causal peer effects of traits and behaviors can be identified using genes (or other structurally isomorphic variables) as instrumental variables (IV) in a large set of data generating models with homophily and confounding. We use directed acyclic graphs to represent these models and employ multiple IV strategies and report three main identification results. First, using a single fixed gene (or allele) as an IV will generally fail to identify peer effects if the gene affects past values of the treatment. Second, multiple fixed genes/alleles, or, more promisingly, time-varying gene expression, can identify peer effects if we instrument exclusion violations as well as the focal treatment. Third, we show that IV identification of peer effects remains possible even under multiple complications often regarded as lethal for IV identification of intra-individual effects, such as pleiotropy on observables and unobservables, homophily on past phenotype, past and ongoing homophily on genotype, inter-phenotype peer effects, population stratification, gene expression that is endogenous to past phenotype and past gene expression, and others. We apply our identification results to estimating peer effects of body mass index (BMI) among friends and spouses in the Framingham Heart Study. Results suggest a positive causal peer effect of BMI between friends.",
Is fertility contagious? Using panel data to disentangle mechanisms of social network influences on fertility decisions,ADVANCES IN LIFE COURSE RESEARCH,Sep 2014,2014,"Using panel data (N = 1.679 married and cohabiting couples), this paper investigates the presence and causal mechanisms of social contagion processes regarding first births. Results confirmed the hypothesized positive association between the number of network members (friends, acquaintances, siblings) with young children and the respondents' transition rate into parenthood, particularly among younger couples. Several potential intervening mechanisms underlying this social contagion effect were tested. First, evidence was found for observational learning processes in which Ego obtained information on the joys and challenges of parenthood from network members with children. Second, childless respondents tended to feel pressured from couples with children in the network to start a family. Third, results supported the notion of social opportunity costs in that the anticipated loss of social ties after becoming a parent was more likely the fewer parents there were in the network. All three mechanisms exerted a positive impact on both fertility intentions and behavior. Panel regression models relying on intraindividtal change scores showed that social learning was the most robust mechanism. An additional indirect test for causality suggested that the findings were unlikely to merely reflect parental status homophily (i.e., selection effects). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The Allure of Homophily in Social Media: Evidence from Investor Responses on Virtual Communities,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Sep 2014,2014,"Millions of people participate in online social media to exchange and share information. Presumably, such information exchange could improve decision making and provide instrumental benefits to the participants. However, to benefit from the information access provided by online social media, the participant will have to overcome the allure of homophily-which refers to the propensity to seek interactions with others of similar status (e. g., religion, education, income, occupation) or values (e. g., attitudes, beliefs, and aspirations). This research assesses the extent to which social media participants exhibit homophily (versus heterophily) in a unique context-virtual investment communities (VICs). We study the propensity of investors in seeking interactions with others with similar sentiments in VICs and identify theoretically important and meaningful conditions under which homophily is attenuated. To address this question, we used a discrete choice model to analyze 682,781 messages on Yahoo! Finance message boards for 29 Dow Jones stocks and assess how investors select a particular thread to respond. Our results revealed that, despite the benefits from heterophily, investors are not immune to the allure of homophily in interactions in VICs. The tendency to exhibit homophily is attenuated by an investor's experience in VICs, the amount of information in the thread, but amplified by stock volatility. The paper discusses important implications for practice.",
A multi-theoretical kernel-based approach to social network-based recommendation,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Sep 2014,2014,"Recommender systems are a critical component of e-commerce websites. The rapid development of online social networking services provides an opportunity to explore social networks together with information used in traditional recommender systems, such as customer demographics, product characteristics, and transactions. It also provides more applications for recommender systems. To tackle this social network-based recommendation problem, previous studies generally built trust models in light of the social influence theory. This study inspects a spectrum of social network theories to systematically model the multiple facets of a social network and infer user preferences. In order to effectively make use of these heterogonous theories, we take a kernel-based machine learning paradigm, design and select kernels describing individual similarities according to social network theories, and employ a non-linear multiple kernel learning algorithm to combine the kernels into a unified model. This design also enables us to consider multiple theories' interactions in assessing individual behaviors. We evaluate our proposed approach on a real-world movie review data set The experiments show that our approach provides more accurate recommendations than trust-based methods and the collaborative filtering approach. Further analysis shows that kernels derived from contagion theory and homophily theory contribute a larger portion of the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Social Support and the Religious Dimensions of Close Ties,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,Sep 2014,2014,"Despite the influence of social support on physical and mental health, few studies have examined why some close ties are more supportive than others. Though religion provides a rich context for social interaction and a meaningful social identity, it has received little attention in the social support literature. A growing literature on religion and health offers insight into how religion affects social support processes. Using dyadic network data derived from the nationally representative 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, I examine how the religious dimensions of close, nonhousehold ties relate to provision of social support. Results from logistic regression analyses indicate that (controlling for a range of other social tie characteristics) same-faith ties are significantly more likely to be sources of help in times of need, while religious discussion is a strong predictor of receiving both help and advice. The effect of religious homophily is strongest for evangelical Protestants and African-American Protestants. My findings underscore the need for social support researchers to consider the role of religion in shaping support processes in close relationships.",
Does Social Proximity Enhance Business Partnerships? Theory and Evidence from Ethnicity's Role in US Venture Capital,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Sep 2014,2014,"W e develop a formal model to understand the selection and influence effects of social proximity (homophily) between business partners. Consistent with the model's predictions, we find that U.S. venture capitalists (VCs) are more likely to select start-ups with coethnic executives for investment, particularly when the probability of the start-up's success appears low. Ethnic proximity between VCs and the start-ups they invest in is positively related to performance, measured by the probability of the companies' successful exit through acquisitions and initial public offerings (IPOs) and net income after IPO. Two-stage regression estimates suggest that these positive performance outcomes are largely due to influence, that is, superior communication and coordination between coethnic VCs and start-up executives after the investment. To the extent that VCs expect to work better with coethnic start-ups, they invest in coethnic ventures that are of lower observable quality than noncoethnic ventures.",
Homophily in the Guise of Cross-Linking: Political Blogs and Content,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,Sep 2014,2014,"This study examines the behavior of influential political blogs (conservative and liberal) in reference to external viral content during March 2007 and June 2009. We analyze homophily and cross-ideological (heterophily) practices. We propose a multidimensional model that employs both qualitative and quantitative methods for examining homophily behaviors by looking at three dimensions: blog-to-blog, blog-tovideo, blog post-to-video. Findings show that while homophily patterns prevail, some limited occurrences of cross-ideological practices exist. The cross-linking practices may include deliberative motives, but in essence they are not created for the purposes of discourse. Instead, these cross-linking practices strengthen previously held political stances of the users who create them and negatively portray and reframe content of alternative views. This represents homophily in the guise of cross-linking.",
Results from using a new dyadic-dependence model to analyze sociocentric physician networks,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Sep 2014,2014,"Professional physician networks can potentially influence clinical practices and quality of care. With the current focus on coordinated care, discerning influences of naturally occurring clusters and other forms of dependence among physicians' relationships based on their attributes and care patterns is an important area of research. In this paper, two directed physician networks: a physician influential conversation network (N = 33) and a physician network obtained from patient visit data (N = 135) are analyzed using a new model that accounts for effect modification of the within-dyad effect of reciprocity and inter-dyad effects involving three (or more) actors. The results from this model include more nuanced effects involving reciprocity and triadic dependence than under incumbent models and more flexible control for these effects in the extraction of other network phenomena, including the relationship between similarity of individuals' attributes (e.g., same-gender, same residency location) and tie-status. In both cases we find extensive evidence of clustering and triadic dependence that if not accounted for confounds the effect of reciprocity and attribute homophily. Findings from our analysis suggest alternative conclusions to those from incumbent models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
A Sensitivity Analysis of Egocentric Measures of Peer Delinquency to Latent Homophily: A Research Note,JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY,Sep 2014,2014,"Egocentric measures of peer delinquency, obtained through a census of a social network, have become the preferred operationalization for examining the relationships between social influence and delinquency. Studies regressing ego's delinquency on the delinquency of nominated friend/s (i.e. alter/s) conclude that a statistically significant coefficient provides evidence of social influence. However, the inferences drawn from these studies may be biased by the introduction of artificial statistical dependence as a consequence of using social network data in a regression framework. Recent work (Shalizi and Thomas Sociol Methods Res 40:211-239, 2011) shows that latent homophily, or unmeasured confounding of observables, may lead to nonzero estimates of social influence, even if there is no causal significance. To examine this possibility, sensitivity analyses have been created (e.g. VanderWeele and Arah Epidemiology 22:42-52, 2011; VanderWeele Sociol Methods Res 40:240-255, 2011) to determine the robustness of an estimated coefficient to latent homophily.In this research note, I examine the robustness of estimates for social influence from two articles (Haynie Am J Sociol 106:1013-1057, 2001; Meldrum et al. J Res Crime Delinq 46:353-376, 2009) using egocentric measures of peer delinquency.Findings indicate that for large, precise point estimates, highly improbable conditions are needed to explain away the effects of social influence. However, less precise point estimates (i.e. large standard errors) are more sensitive to latent homophily.The analyses indicate that studies using egocentric measures should conduct sensitivity tests, particularly when the estimated effect is weak and/or has a relatively large standard error. Scripts written in the free programming language R (R Core Team R: a language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 2012) are provided for researchers to conduct such analyses.",
Homophily and heterophily in personal networks. From mutual acquaintance to relationship intensity,QUALITY & QUANTITY,Sep 2014,2014,"This article deals with the analysis of homophily and heterophily in ego-centred networks (personal networks). The analysis takes a dual approach. First it uses the classical definition of homophily (in this article called elementary homophily) to compare mutual ties between groups defined by employment status, age and city of residence. These analyses are then enriched by incorporating the level of affective proximity, thus forming what we have called specific homophily. The analysis of elementary homophily confirms the expected predominance of homophilous relationships over heterophilous ones. The analysis of specific homophily shows that inter-group relationships between close and intimate contacts follow similar patterns, whereas these differ substantially for relationships that are not at all close. The comparison of the two types of homophily shows a correspondence between high values in elementary homophily and high values in close and intimate relationships.",
Homophily without community. Upper-middle-class aggregation within Paris refounded neighborhoods,ACTES DE LA RECHERCHE EN SCIENCES SOCIALES,Sep 2014,2014,"This article is based on fieldwork conducted in three new neighborhoods of Courbevoie and Levallois-Perret (Hauts-deSeine, west of Paris), which are located near the business district of La Defense, and where corporate professionals and managers are overrepresented among the residents. These areas have been transformed by the process of new-build gentrification that regularly contributes to enlarging the historic western axis of Paris' upper-class neighborhoods. The paper analyzes successively the causes and motivations of the inhabitants' residential choices, the weak local sociability associated with this specific type of urban self-segregation, and the key role played by the drawing of socioeconomic symbolic boundaries among the upper middle classes. Indeed, homophilic aggregation in the refounded neighborhoods follows a logic largely different and autonomous from the (complementary) one based on radical alterization and stigmatization that motivates the avoidance of the working class.",
"Emotions under Discussion: Gender, Status and Communication in Online Collaboration",PLOS ONE,Aug 20 2014,2014,"Background: Despite the undisputed role of emotions in teamwork, not much is known about the make-up of emotions in online collaboration. Publicly available repositories of collaboration data, such as Wikipedia editor discussions, now enable the large-scale study of affect and dialogue in peer production.Methods: We investigate the established Wikipedia community and focus on how emotion and dialogue differ depending on the status, gender, and the communication network of the approximate to 12,000 editors who have written at least 100 comments on the English Wikipedia's article talk pages. Emotions are quantified using a word-based approach comparing the results of two predefined lexicon-based methods: LIWC and SentiStrength.Principal Findings: We find that administrators maintain a rather neutral, impersonal tone, while regular editors are more emotional and relationship-oriented, that is, they use language to form and maintain connections to other editors. A persistent gender difference is that female contributors communicate in a manner that promotes social affiliation and emotional connection more than male editors, irrespective of their status in the community. Female regular editors are the most relationship-oriented, whereas male administrators are the least relationship-focused. Finally, emotional and linguistic homophily is prevalent: editors tend to interact with other editors having similar emotional styles (e. g., editors expressing more anger connect more with one another).Conclusions/Significance: Emotional expression and linguistic style in online collaboration differ substantially depending on the contributors' gender and status, and on the communication network. This should be taken into account when analyzing collaborative success, and may prove insightful to communities facing gender gap and stagnation in contributor acquisition and participation levels.",
The Circulation of Interpersonal Credit in Renaissance Florence,ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE,Aug 2014,2014,"We analyze a network of 3,590 interpersonal credit ties among Renaissance Florentine elite households to determine how Florentine personal credit was socially structured. We assess the network in light of various social and economic motivations Florentines might have had to exchange credit with each other. We explore the extent of participation by people from different categories, such as neighborhoods, factions, and guilds, and we determine whether loans flowed primarily within or between such groupings. We observe considerable homophily within families and neighborhoods, but also extensive circulation of credit among the most commercially and politically active Florentines. The overall connectivity of this network of interpersonal credit transactions resembles the social structure of other contemporaneous Florentine networks, such as marriage and business, suggesting that interpersonal credit was an important and distinct domain in which elite membership was confirmed and elite social solidarity achieved.",
Top management ties with board members: How they affect pay-performance sensitivity and IPO performance,JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE,Aug 2014,2014,"This paper is the first study on the effects of pay-performance sensitivity (PPS) on the performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the presence of social ties and family ties of the top managers with board members. We find that both social ties and family ties increase PPS. In turn, PPS improves IPO performance. More importantly, greater PPS increases the positive effect of social ties on IPO performance whereas it reduces the negative effect of family ties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Multidimensional Homophily in Friendship Networks.,Network science (Cambridge University Press),2014-Aug,2014,"Homophily - the tendency for individuals to associate with similar others - is one of the most persistent findings in social network analysis. Its importance is established along the lines of a multitude of sociologically relevant dimensions, e.g. sex, ethnicity and social class. Existing research, however, mostly focuses on one dimension at a time. But people are inherently multidimensional, have many attributes and are members of multiple groups. In this article, we explore such multidimensionality further in the context of network dynamics. Are friendship ties increasingly likely to emerge and persist when individuals have an increasing number of attributes in common? We analyze eleven friendship networks of adolescents, draw on stochastic actor-oriented network models and focus on the interaction of established homophily effects. Our results indicate that main effects for homophily on various dimensions are positive. At the same time, the interaction of these homophily effects is negative. There seems to be a diminishing effect for having more than one attribute in common. We conclude that studies of homophily and friendship formation need to address such multidimensionality further.",
Complexity in models of cultural niche construction with selection and homophily,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jul 22 2014,2014,"Niche construction is the process by which organisms can alter the ecological environment for themselves, their descendants, and other species. As a result of niche construction, differences in selection pressures may be inherited across generations. Homophily, the tendency of like phenotypes to mate or preferentially associate, influences the evolutionary dynamics of these systems. Here we develop a model that includes selection and homophily as independent culturally transmitted traits that influence the fitness and mate choice determined by another focal cultural trait. We study the joint dynamics of a focal set of beliefs, a behavior that can differentially influence the fitness of those with certain beliefs, and a preference for partnering based on similar beliefs. Cultural transmission, selection, and homophily interact to produce complex evolutionary dynamics, including oscillations, stable polymorphisms of all cultural phenotypes, and simultaneous stability of oscillation and fixation, which have not previously been observed in models of cultural evolution or gene-culture interactions. We discuss applications of this model to the interaction of beliefs and behaviors regarding education, contraception, and animal domestication.",
Culture-dependent strategies in coordination games,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jul 22 2014,2014,"We examine different populations' play in coordination games in online experiments with over 1,000 study participants. Study participants played a two-player coordination game that had multiple equilibria: two equilibria with highly asymmetric payoffs and another equilibrium with symmetric payoffs but a slightly lower total payoff. Study participants were predominantly from India and the United States. Study participants residing in India played the strategies leading to asymmetric payoffs significantly more frequently than study participants residing in the United States who showed a greater play of the strategy leading to the symmetric payoffs. In addition, when prompted to play asymmetrically, the population from India responded even more significantly than those from the United States. Overall, study participants' predictions of how others would play were more accurate when the other player was from their own populations, and they coordinated significantly more frequently and earned significantly higher payoffs when matched with other study participants from their own population than when matched across populations.",
Aperiodic dynamics in a deterministic adaptive network model of attitude formation in social groups,PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA,Jul 15 2014,2014,"Adaptive network models, in which node states and network topology coevolve, arise naturally in models of social dynamics that incorporate homophily and social influence. Homophily relates the similarity between pairs of nodes' states to their network coupling strength, whilst social influence causes coupled nodes' states to convergence. In this paper we propose a deterministic adaptive network model of attitude formation in social groups that includes these effects, and in which the attitudinal dynamics are represented by an activator inhibitor process. We illustrate that consensus, corresponding to all nodes adopting the same attitudinal state and being fully connected, may destabilise via Turing instability, giving rise to aperiodic dynamics with sensitive dependence on initial conditions. These aperiodic dynamics correspond to the formation and dissolution of sub-groups that adopt contrasting attitudes. We discuss our findings in the context of cultural polarisation phenomena.

"Culture, role and group work: A social network analysis perspective on an online collaborative course",BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,Jul 2014,2014,This paper discusses the patterns of network dynamics within a multicultural online collaborative learning environment. It analyses the interaction of participants (both students and facilitators) within a discussion board that was established as part of a 3-month online collaborative course. The study employs longitudinal probabilistic social network analysis (SNA) to identify the patterns and trends within the network. It conjectures and tests a set of hypotheses concerning the tendencies towards homophily/heterophily and preferential attachment. The paper presents identified interaction network patterns in relation to cultural differences. It also evaluates network dynamics by considering participant roles and group work in the course under study. Results of social network analyses are reported along with measures of statistical confidence in findings. The potential for extending exploratory SNA methods and visualisation techniques in educational research are discussed here.,
Predicting online channel acceptance with social network data,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Jul 2014,2014,"The goal of this paper is to identify a new way to predict whether a specific person believes buying online is appropriate for a specific product. By analyzing data that was gathered through a survey, we show that knowledge of a person's social network can be helpful to predict that person's e-commerce acceptance for different products. Our experimental setup is interesting for companies because (1) knowledge about only a small number of connections of potential customers is needed, (2) knowing the intensity of the relation is not necessary, and (3) data concerning variables such as age, gender and whether one likes working with the PC is not needed. Hence, companies can rely on publicly available data on their customers' social ties. Network-based classifiers tend to perform especially well for highly durable goods and for services for which few customers think it is appropriate to reserve them online. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using Social Network Analysis to Clarify the Role of Obesity in Selection of Adolescent Friends,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Jul 2014,2014,"Objectives. We used social network analysis to examine how weight status affects friend selection, with an emphasis on homophily and the social marginalization of overweight youths.Methods. We used an exponential random graph model to assess the effects of body mass index (BMI) on friend selection while controlling for several alternative selection processes. Data were derived from 58 987 students in 88 US middle and high schools who took part in the 1994 to 1996 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.Results. On average, overweight youths were less likely than nonoverweight youths to be selected as a friend; however, this effect differed according to the BMI of the person initiating the friendship. Nonoverweight youths were 30% more likely to select a nonoverweight friend than an overweight friend, whereas overweight youths were largely indifferent to the weight status of their friends. Friendship ties from overweight youths to nonoverweight peers were more likely than ties in the reverse direction.Conclusions. We found evidence consistent with homophily and social marginalization but only for the selection behavior of nonoverweight youths. We conclude that avoidance of overweight friends is the primary determinant of friendship patterns related to BMI.",
ASSORTATIVE SOCIAL LEARNING AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN (AND ANIMAL?) SOCIETIES,EVOLUTION,Jul 2014,2014,"Choosing from whom to learn is an important element of social learning. It affects learner success and the profile of behaviors in the population. Because individuals often differ in their traits and capabilities, their benefits from different behaviors may also vary. Homophily, or assortment, the tendency of individuals to interact with other individuals with similar traits, is known to affect the spread of behaviors in humans. We introduce models to study the evolution of assortative social learning (ASL), where assorting on a trait acts as an individual-specific mechanism for filtering relevant models from which to learn when that trait varies. We show that when the trait is polymorphic, ASL may maintain a stable behavioral polymorphism within a population (independently of coexistence with individual learning in a population). We explore the evolution of ASL when assortment is based on a nonheritable or partially heritable trait, and when ASL competes with different non-ASL strategies: oblique (learning from the parental generation) and vertical (learning from the parent). We suggest that the tendency to assort may be advantageous in the context of social learning, and that ASL might be an important concept for the evolutionary theory of social learning.",
RANDOM WALK-BASED SEGREGATION MEASURES,REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,Jul 2014,2014,"We propose an intuitive way of how to measure segregation in social and spatial networks. Using random walks, we define the segregation index as the probability that an individual meets an individual from the same social group. The segregation index is a generalization of the isolation index and a homophily index introduced in Currarini, Jackson, and Pin (2009), and it has a closed-form relation to PageRank that facilitates its computation. We also show that the Spectral Segregation Index proposed by Echenique and Fryer (2007) is not continuous with respect to the network structure. Finally, we apply the measure to Spanish census data and to citations data from economics, and rationalize the index as the equilibrium outcome of a game.",
A behavior genetic analysis of the tendency for youth to associate according to GPA,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2014,2014,"Behavior genetic research has revealed that many ""environmental"" variables are partially influenced by genetic factors. Known as gene-environment correlation (rGE), this line of scholarship provides insight on how and why individuals select into certain environments. Juxtaposing this body of evidence with research on peer group homophily-the tendency for peers to resemble one another on certain traits such as academic ability-raised two research hypotheses: (1) youth will associate with peers who receive grades similar to themselves (i.e., homophily for GPA); and (2) a portion of the variance in peer group GPA (i.e., the peer network average GPA) will be explained by individuals' genetic self-selection into the peer group (rGE). The results supported both hypotheses by showing a strong predictive relationship between the target individual's GPA and that of his/her peers and by revealing that 72% of the variance in peer group GPA was explained by genetic influences.

Using an Agent-Based Model to Simulate the Development of Risk Behaviors During Adolescence,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Jun 30 2014,2014,"Adolescents tend to adopt behaviors that are similar to those of their friends, and also tend to become friends with peers that have similar interests and behaviors. This tendency towards homogeneity applies not only to conventional behaviors such as working for school and participating in sports activities, but also to risk behaviors such as drug use, oppositional behavior or unsafe sex. The current study aims at building an agent model to answer the following related questions: How do friendship groups evolve and what is the role of behavioral similarity in friendship formation? How does homogeneity among peers emerge, with regard to conventional as well as risk behaviors? On the basis of the theoretical and empirical literature on friendship selection and influences on risk behavior during adolescence we first developed a conceptual framework, which was then translated into a mathematical model of a dynamic system and implemented as an agent-based computer simulation consisting of simple behavioral rules and principles. Each agent in the model holds distinct property matrices including an individual behavioral profile with a list of risky (i.e., alcohol use, aggressiveness, soft drugs) and conventional behaviors (i.e., school attendance, sports, work). The computer model simulates the development, during one school year, of a social network (i.e. formation of friendships and cliques), the (dyadic) interactions between pupils and their behavioral profiles. During the course of simulation, the agents' behavioral profiles change on the basis of their interactions resulting in individual developmental curves of conventional and risk behaviors. These profiles are used to calculate the (behavioral) similarity and differences between the various agents. Generally, the model output is analyzed by means of visual inspection (i.e., plotting developmental curves of behavior and social networks), systematic comparison and by calculating additional measures (i.e., using specific social analysis software packages). Simulation results conclusively indicate model validity. The model simulates qualitative properties currently found in research on adolescent development, namely the role of homophily, the appearance of friendship clusters, and the increase in behavioral homogeneity among friends. The model not only converges with empirical findings, but furthermore helps to explain social psychological phenomena (e.g. the emergence of homophily among adolescents).",
Genetic and educational assortative mating among US adults,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jun 3 2014,2014,"Understanding the social and biological mechanisms that lead to homogamy (similar individuals marrying one another) has been a long-standing issue across many fields of scientific inquiry. Using a nationally representative sample of non-Hispanic white US adults from the Health and Retirement Study and information from 1.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we compare genetic similarity among married couples to noncoupled pairs in the population. We provide evidence for genetic assortative mating in this population but the strength of this association is substantially smaller than the strength of educational assortative mating in the same sample. Furthermore, genetic similarity explains at most 10% of the assortative mating by education levels. Results are replicated using comparable data from the Framingham Heart Study.",
"Check-ins in ""Blau Space"": Applying Blau's Macrosociological Theory to Foursquare Check-ins from New York City",ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY,Jun 2014,2014,"Peter Blau was one of the first to define a latent social space and utilize it to provide concrete hypotheses. Blau defines social structure via social ""parameters"" (constraints). Actors that are closer together (more homogenous) in this social parameter space are more likely to interact. One of Blau's most important hypotheses resulting from this work was that the consolidation of parameters could lead to isolated social groups. For example, the consolidation of race and income might lead to segregation. In the present work, we use Foursquare data from New York City to explore evidence of homogeneity along certain social parameters and consolidation that breeds social isolation in communities of locations checked in to by similar users.More specifically, we first test the extent to which communities detected via Latent Dirichlet Allocation are homogenous across a set of four social constraints-racial homophily, income homophily, personal interest homophily and physical space. Using a bootstrapping approach, we find that 14 (of 20) communities are statistically, and all but one qualitatively, homogenous along one of these social constraints, showing the relevance of Blau's latent space model in venue communities determined via user check-in behavior. We then consider the extent to which communities with consolidated parameters, those homogenous on more than one parameter, represent socially isolated populations. We find communities homogenous on multiple parameters, including a homosexual community and a ""hipster"" community, that show support for Blau's hypothesis that consolidation breeds social isolation. We consider these results in the context of mediated communication, in particular in the context of self-representation on social media.",
HIV risk practices by female sex workers according to workplace,REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA,Jun 2014,2014,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in HIV infection-related risk practices by Female Sex Workers according to workplace and the effects of homophily on estimating HIV prevalence.METHODS: Data from 2,523 women, recruited using Respondent-Driven Sampling, were used for the study carried out in 10 Brazilian cities in 2008-2009. The study included female sex workers aged 18 and over. The questionnaire was completed by the subjects and included questions on characteristics of professional activity, sexual practices, use of drugs, HIV testing, and access to health services. HIV quick tests were conducted. The participants were classified in two groups according to place of work: on the street or indoor venues, like nightclubs and saunas. To compare variable distributions by place of work, we used Chi-square homogeneity tests, taking into consideration unequal selection probabilities as well as the structure of dependence between observations. We tested the effect of homophily by workplace on estimated HIV prevalence.RESULTS: The highest HIV risk practices were associated with: working on the streets, lower socioeconomic status, low regular smear test coverage, higher levels of crack use and higher levels of syphilis serological scars as well as higher prevalence of HIV infection. The effect of homophily was higher among sex workers in indoor venues. However, it did not affect the estimated prevalence of HIV, even after using a post-stratification by workplace procedure.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that strategies should focus on extending access to, and utilization of, health services. Prevention policies should be specifically aimed at street workers. Regarding the application of Respondent-Driven Sampling, the sample should be sufficient to estimate transition probabilities, as the network develops more quickly among sex workers in indoor venues.",
"It's Not Who You Know, but Who You Add: An investigation into the differential impact of friend adding and self-disclosure on interpersonal perceptions on Facebook",COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jun 2014,2014,"This research seeks to understand how people perceive and respond to structural factors and different types of disclosure on Facebook when evaluating the profile of someone they have never met offline. Using a 2 x 3 x 2 between-subjects experimental design, this research explored the relationship between friend adding (add; no add), levels of self-disclosure (low, medium, high), and sex of the Facebook profile owner (male; female) on feelings of interpersonal liking, future behavioral intentions to interact, and homophily. Results indicated that friend adding and higher levels of self-disclosure led to greater feelings of interpersonal liking and homophily amongst both male and female participants. In addition, males tended to view other male profiles with moderate amounts of disclosure and female profiles with the highest amount of disclosure most favorably. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
"Social Distance in the United States: Sex, Race, Religion, Age, and Education Homophily among Confidants, 1985 to 2004",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Jun 2014,2014,"Homophily, the tendency for similar actors to be connected at a higher rate than dissimilar actors, is a pervasive social fact. In this article, we examine changes over a 20-year period in two types of homophily-the actual level of contact between people in different social categories and the level of contact relative to chance. We use data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys to ask whether the strengths of five social distinctions-sex, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, age, and education-changed over the past two decades in core discussion networks. Changes in the actual level of homophily are driven by the demographic composition of the United States. As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries.",
Impact of Homophily on Diffusion Dynamics Over Social Networks,SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW,Jun 2014,2014,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of homophily on diffusion over social networks. An agent-based simulation model is developed to serve as the experimental ground for this analysis. Diffusion dynamics of a nonsticky innovation is investigated by varying homophily levels in the social network depicted in the model as the primary control variable. First of all, the results show that homophily is self-reinforcing. Second, starting from a nonhomophilous network, early increases in the level of homophily have a positive effect on the extent of diffusion, whereas further increases have a negative impact. Finally, several local minima and maxima are observed in the relation between the homophily level and the extent of diffusion. Our analysis focuses on node properties such as connectedness and average degrees in order to explain the observed regular relationship between homophily and diffusion. We argue that (i) homophily increases the connectedness of different status groups separately and (ii) increasing levels of homophily decreases the marginal importance of a single homophilous tie by increasing the sources of valuable information. Future research involves investigating the coevolution of social behavior and networks by allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily, exploration of different diffusion initiation types, and different adoption heuristics.",
Charitable giving when altruism and similarity are linked,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,Jun 2014,2014,"This paper presents a model in which anonymous charitable donations are rationalized by two human tendencies drawn from the psychology literature. The first is people's disproportionate disposition to help those they agree with while the second is the dependence of peoples' self-esteem on the extent to which they perceive that others agree with them. Government spending crowds out the charity that ensues from these forces only modestly. Moreover, people's donations tend to rise when others donate. In some equilibria of the model, poor people give little because they expect donations to come mainly from richer individuals. In others, donations by poor individuals constitute a large fraction of donations and this raises the incentive for poor people to donate. The model provides interpretations for episodes in which the number of charities rises while total donations are stagnant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Immigrant Adolescents' Adaptation to a New Context: Ethnic Friendship Homophily and Its Predictors,CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES,Jun 2014,2014,"Although interethnic friendships are among the best indicators of social adaptation to a new cultural context, adolescent immigrants form friendships predominantly within their own ethnic community, a phenomenon called friendship homophily. In this article, I focus on the acculturation of immigrant adolescents and on the factors that lead them to form friendships within their group, including acculturation-related behaviors, mutual attitudes of native and immigrant groups, developmental age-related considerations, and the context in which these adolescents live. The results present opportunities not only for reducing friendship homophily but also point to the complexity of acculturation research and the need to study side effects of adolescents' adaptation to a new context.",
"Social Achievement Goals, Efficacious Beliefs, and Math Performance in a Predominately African American High School",JOURNAL OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY,Jun 2014,2014,"The study is the first to examine the relationship among students' social achievement goals, self-efficacy, collective efficacy of classmates and teachers, and math performance. In addition, the study examined homophily, or the tendency for peer group members to hold similar beliefs, for social achievement goals, efficacious beliefs, and math performance. Participants were 210 students from a predominately African American high school. Boys' social achievement goals predicted twice as much collective efficacy than girls' social achievement goals. In addition, self-efficacy positively predicted math performance for girls, but not so for boys. Social achievement goal homophily was only present for girls. Self-efficacy and math performance homophily was present for both boys and girls.",
The Importance of Race and Religion in Social Service Providers,SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY,Jun 2014,2014,"ObjectivesThe objectives of this study are to investigate the traits that clients find important in professional social service providers, comparing confidence in client management skills (friendliness, experience, and knowledge) to desire for demographic characteristics (being of the same race and religion).MethodsTo accomplish this task, we use multiple regression to analyze results of the Lehigh Valley Trust Survey of low-income recipients of social services.ResultsWhile most respondents find the professional traits important, there is significant variation in whether respondents consider demographic characteristics to be important. We find that having a provider of the same race is very important for African Americans and Hispanics, while having a provider with similar religious beliefs is extremely important for evangelical Protestants. Other predictive variables for homophilous preferences in race and religion are age, mobility, and education.ConclusionsProfessional skills corresponding to organizational position are important to most people, but specific demographic groups prioritize racial, ethnic, and religious homophily. While we suggest some possible explanations (perceived or actual discrimination and cultural concordance), further research is needed to determine the causes.",
Evolution via imitation among like-minded individuals,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,May 21 2014,2014,"In social situations with which evolutionary game is concerned, individuals are considered to be heterogeneous in various aspects. In particular, they may differently perceive the same outcome of the game owing to heterogeneity in idiosyncratic preferences, fighting abilities, and positions in a social network. In such a population, an individual may imitate successful and similar others, where similarity refers to that in the idiosyncratic fitness function. I propose an evolutionary game model with two subpopulations on the basis of multipopulation replicator dynamics to describe such a situation. In the proposed model, pairs of players are involved in a two-person game as a well-mixed population, and imitation occurs within subpopulations in each of which players have the same payoff matrix. It is shown that the model does not allow any internal equilibrium such that the dynamics differs from that of other related models such as the bimatrix game. In particular, even a slight difference in the payoff matrix in the two subpopulations can make the opposite strategies to be stably selected in the two subpopulations in the snowdrift and coordination games.

Making friends and communicating on Facebook: Implications for the access to social capital,SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2014,2014,"In this paper, we explore the dynamics of access to social capital on Facebook. Existing approaches to network-based social capital measures are adapted to the case of Facebook and applied to the friendship and communication data of 438,851 users. These measures are correlated to user data in order to identify advantageous behavior for optimizing the possible access to social capital. We find that the access to social capital on Facebook is primarily based on a reasonable amount of active communication. Exaggerated friending and posting behavior can deteriorate the access to social capital. Furthermore, we investigate which kinds of posts are most advantageous as well as questions of homophily based on social capital. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.",
Homophily versus preferential attachment: Evolutionary mechanisms of scientific collaboration networks,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C,May 2014,2014,"Homophily and preferential attachment are among the most recognized mechanisms of network evolution. Instead of examining the two mechanisms separately, this study considers them jointly in a scholarly collaboration network. Specifically, when a new scholar enters a field, how does he/she choose the first collaborator from the pool of available scholars? We find that new scholars tend to collaborate with someone who works in the same institution (which is called constrained acceptance), shares similar specialty interests (active choice), or has already worked with many collaborators (random action). We view constrained acceptance and active choice as supporting evidence for homophily (because similarity is attractive) and random action as supporting evidence for preferential attachment (because popularity is attractive). As such, both homophily and preferential attachment affect the evolution of collaboration networks. Furthermore, the influences vary over time with random action, constrained acceptance, and active choice taking turns to act the dominant force at the beginning, middle and later phases of the evolution process, respectively.",
From Hot Cakes to Cold Feet: A Contingent Perspective on the Relationship between Market Uncertainty and Status Homophily in the Formation of Alliances,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES,May 2014,2014,"In this study, we reconsider the classical positive association between the level of market uncertainty and an organization's propensity to form ties with organizations of similar status. Although prior research argues that the greater the uncertainty, the higher the level of status homophily, we suggest that this relationship is contingent upon framing that affects positive or negative valence towards uncertainty. In an up market, organizations tend to frame uncertainty as upside risk, and thus will subsequently favour explorative uncertainty-mitigation devices; whereas, in a down market, organizations primarily frame uncertainty as downward risk, and thus will rely on more conservative uncertainty-mitigation mechanisms. We therefore predict that a greater number of status-heterophilous ties will be formed in an up market than in a down market. We discuss the implications of our results for status theory and more broadly for research on strategic decision making under uncertainty.",
Intergroup networks as random threshold graphs,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Apr 24 2014,2014,"Similar-minded people tend to form social groups. Due to pluralistic homophily as well as a sort of heterophily, people also participate in a wide variety of groups. Thus, these groups generally overlap with each other; an overlap between two groups can be characterized by the number of common members. These common members can play a crucial role in the transmission of information between the groups. As a step towards understanding the information dissemination, we perceive the system as a pruned intergroup network and show that it maps to a very basic graph theoretic concept known as a threshold graph. We analyze several structural properties of this network such as degree distribution, largest component size, edge density, and local clustering coefficient. We compare the theoretical predictions with the results obtained from several online social networks (LiveJournal, Flickr, YouTube) and find a good match.",
Homophily and the Speed of Social Mobilization: The Effect of Acquired and Ascribed Traits,PLOS ONE,Apr 16 2014,2014,"Large-scale mobilization of individuals across social networks is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. However, little is known about what affects the speed of social mobilization. Here we use a framed field experiment to identify and measure properties of individuals and their relationships that predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal traits of the participants and those they recruited. We studied the effects of ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits (geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with similar traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was present for acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when the recuiter and recruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In contrast, we did not find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits had other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first heard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased in speed when hearing from less personal source types (e. g. family vs. media). These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization tasks for increased speed.",
Beyond ethnicity,ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES,Apr 16 2014,2014,"The 'comparative analytic of ethnic forms' developed in Andreas Wimmer's Ethnic Boundary Making makes a major contribution towards specifying why ethnicity matters to different degrees and in different ways in differing social and historical contexts. My comment raises two issues for discussion. I question whether nationhood can be fully subsumed under the overarching rubric of ethnicity. And I suggest that there may be a certain cost to stretching the undeniably fruitful boundary metaphor too far. I conclude by noting that the processes analysed in the book are in no way specific to ethnicity, and that the book points beyond ethnicity to a broader theory of the making and unmaking of groups.",
Identification of Direct and Indirect Social Network Effects in the Pathophysiology of Insulin Resistance in Obese Human Subjects,PLOS ONE,Apr 7 2014,2014,"Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine to what extent different social network mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin-resistance.Design: We used nonparametric and parametric regression models to analyse whether individual BMI and HOMA-IR are determined by social network characteristics.Subjects and Methods: A total of 677 probands (EGO) and 3033 social network partners (ALTER) were included in the study. Data gathered from the probands include anthropometric measures, HOMA-IR index, health attitudes, behavioural and socio- economic variables and social network data.Results: We found significant treatment effects for ALTERs frequent dieting (p < 0.001) and ALTERs health oriented nutritional attitudes (p, 0.001) on EGO's BMI, establishing a significant indirect network effect also on EGO's insulin resistance. Most importantly, we also found significant direct social network effects on EGO's insulin resistance, evidenced by an effect of ALTERs frequent dieting (p = 0.033) and ALTERs sport activities (p = 0.041) to decrease EGO's HOMA-IR index independently of EGO's BMI.Conclusions: Social network phenomena appear not only to be relevant for the spread of obesity, but also for the spread of insulin resistance as the basis for type 2 diabetes. Attitudes and behaviour of peer groups influence EGO's health status not only via social mechanisms, but also via socio- biological mechanisms, i.e. higher brain areas might be influenced not only by biological signals from the own organism, but also by behaviour and knowledge from different human individuals. Our approach allows the identification of peer group influence controlling for potential homophily even when using cross-sectional observational data.",
Joint Link Prediction and Attribute Inference Using a Social-Attribute Network,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY,Apr 2014,2014,"The effects of social influence and homophily suggest that both network structure and node-attribute information should inform the tasks of link prediction and node-attribute inference. Recently, Yin et al. [2010a, 2010b] proposed an attribute-augmented social network model, which we call Social-Attribute Network (SAN), to integrate network structure and node attributes to perform both link prediction and attribute inference. They focused on generalizing the random walk with a restart algorithm to the SAN framework and showed improved performance. In this article, we extend the SAN framework with several leading supervised and unsupervised link-prediction algorithms and demonstrate performance improvement for each algorithm on both link prediction and attribute inference. Moreover, we make the novel observation that attribute inference can help inform link prediction, that is, link-prediction accuracy is further improved by first inferring missing attributes. We comprehensively evaluate these algorithms and compare them with other existing algorithms using a novel, large-scale Google+ dataset, which we make publicly available",
Co-authorship research networks in public health in Santander,BIOMEDICA,APR-JUN 2014,2014,"Introduction: Although a good deal of research in public health has been performed, large inequalities still exist in health. It is necessary to know how knowledge is generated and disseminated to the public in order for research to reach decision-makers.Objective: To characterize public health research networks in Santander, Colombia.Materials and methods: Analysis of social networks based on co-authorship of scientific publications by researchers living in Santander in 2012. Researchers were identified using a ""snowball"" technique. The publications search was conducted using national and international databases. The density and average geodesic distance of networks were calculated, as was the size, pairs, brokers and homophily of egocentric networks.Results: There were 531 researchers. Most worked in epidemiology (77.59%), and in more than one thematic field. The network density was 0.0058 and the average geodesic distance was 4.418. Several indicators suggested that the most cohesive egocentric networks were those in which researches investigated more than in one knowledge area or in epidemiology. Homophily was lower for health systems, biostatistics and social and behavioral sciences, as well as private hospitals and the public university.Conclusions: The network structure suggests a growth phase in research and a predominance of epidemiology. Other public health areas need strengthening so as to better address the health needs of the state.",
"Substance Abuse Treatment Utilization, HIV Risk Behaviors, and Recruitment Among Suburban Injection Drug Users in Long Island, New York",AIDS AND BEHAVIOR,Apr 2014,2014,"Prevention and treatment of injection drug use remains a public health concern. We used data from the 2005 Centers for Disease Control and prevention National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system to assess substance abuse treatment utilization, risk behaviors, and recruitment processes in a respondent driven sample of suburban injectors. Twelve service utilization and injection risk variables were analyzed using latent class analysis. Three latent classes were identified: low use, low risk; low use, high risk; and high use, moderate/high risk. In multivariate analysis, annual income <$15,000 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 8.19 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 3.83-17.51]) and self-reported hepatitis C virus infection (aOR = 4.32, 95 % CI (1.84-10.17)) were significantly associated with class membership. Homophily, a measure of preferential recruitment showed that injectors with recent treatment utilization appear a more cohesive group than out-of-treatment injectors. Preferentially reaching injection drug users with high risk behaviors and no recent drug treatment history via respondent driven sampling will require future research.",
Gender identity and lexical variation in social media,JOURNAL OF SOCIOLINGUISTICS,Apr 2014,2014,"We present a study of the relationship between gender, linguistic style, and social networks, using a novel corpus of 14,000 Twitter users. Prior quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.",
Network geometry shows evidence sequestration for medical vs. surgical practices: treatments for basal cell carcinoma,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,Apr 2014,2014,"Objectives: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer with 2 million treatments per year with little evidence-based guidelines for treatment. There are three classes of interventions (surgical, destructive, and topical) for BCC, and this study aimed to determine whether there are preferences or avoidances in comparisons of different types of treatments for BCC in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Study Design and Setting: PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Clinical Trials, and ClinicalTrials.Gov were used to identify eligible published and registered ongoing RCTs.Results: Fifty-five trials (42 published and 13 registered trials) were identified. Only one unpublished registered trial compared a topical vs. a surgical intervention, and only one trial compared a topical vs. a destructive intervention. Conversely, 44 of the 55 trials compared interventions within the same treatment class and 9 of 55 trials compared surgical vs. destructive interventions. In most trials, selection of same-class comparators was not necessitated by the type of BCC lesions (nonaggressive superficial or nodular vs. aggressive, infiltrative, morpheic BCCs, P = 0.155) or their location (face vs. nonfacial, P = 0.137).Conclusion: This is the first time that an evaluation of network geometry is applied to address issues of comparisons between different families of interventions that belong to different specialties and practices (medical vs. surgical). Previous evaluations of homophily have addressed different families of interventions, in which all interventions are medical (drugs) and performed in the same health-care settings. The noncommunicating bodies of evidence between medical and surgical interventions that we document highlight a problem of unnecessary sequestration of the evidence and the corresponding health-care practices.

Echo Chamber or Public Sphere? Predicting Political Orientation and Measuring Political Homophily in Twitter Using Big Data,JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,Apr 2014,2014,"This paper investigates political homophily on Twitter. Using a combination of machine learning and social network analysis we classify users as Democrats or as Republicans based on the political content shared. We then investigate political homophily both in the network of reciprocated and nonreciprocated ties. We find that structures of political homophily differ strongly between Democrats and Republicans. In general, Democrats exhibit higher levels of political homophily. But Republicans who follow official Republican accounts exhibit higher levels of homophily than Democrats. In addition, levels of homophily are higher in the network of reciprocated followers than in the nonreciprocated network. We suggest that research on political homophily on the Internet should take the political culture and practices of users seriously.",
"Founder nativity, founding team formation, and firm performance in the U.S. high-tech sector",INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Mar 2014,2014,"This paper is motivated by the movement of foreign-born entrepreneurs out of ethnic enclaves and into the mainstream, globally-connected economies of the countries of immigration, and from necessity to opportunity entrepreneurship. The theoretical contribution of the paper is to integrate the emerging literature on foreign-born entrepreneurship with work on the composition and impact of founding teams. Empirically, we draw on original quantitative and qualitative data on the U.S. high-tech sector. We find that homophily drives team formation and that nationality diversity in founding teams has a modest impact on firm performance.",
"Coevolutionary Dynamics of Cultural Markers, Parochial Cooperation, and Networks",JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION,Mar 2014,2014,"The emergence and institutionalization of cooperation in sizable groups without reciprocity receives considerable attention in game-theoretical modeling. Agents in our study play the Prisoner's Dilemma game cooperating with tolerably similar neighbors. They may imitate cultural markers (tags) and tolerance from more successful neighbors. Alternatively, they break ties to out-group neighbors. New partners are selected either from neighbors' neighbors (clustering) or randomly. Variations in network plasticity (the likelihood of changing partners rather than being influenced) and clustering are explored. With high plasticity and high clustering, networks tend to fragment. With low plasticity and low clustering, networks tend toward global cooperation, but with severe losses of cultural diversity and tolerance. Cooperation in such regimes also proves to be vulnerable to defection. Between, there is a space displaying relatively stable and widespread cooperation with diversity and tolerance. We note some important structural characteristics of the networks evolving in this space.",
"It Goes Hand in Hand with the Parties: Race, Class, and Residence in College Student Negotiations of Hooking Up",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,SPR 2014,2014,"Hooking up, or sexual activity outside relationships, is a dominant feature of social life on many college campuses. However, research has yet to explore how social location intersects with campus-level factors to shape students' negotiations of this script. Interview data from 87 undergraduates at an urban commuter university demonstrate the distinction between ""adopting"" and ""enacting"" sexual scripts. Although the majority of students locate hooking up as a salient cultural scenario for their lives, the adoption of hooking up does not neatly translate into its enactment for all students. Where students live emerges as a fault line systematically structuring opportunities for hooking up. There are racial and class divisions even among students with similar residential locations, reflecting the importance of socioeconomic resources and peer group homophily to sexuality. This study points to how race, class, and residence integrally shape the interpersonal sexual scripts of college students.",
"Gender Homophily, Ph.D.Completion, and Time to Degree in the Humanities and Humanistic Social Sciences",REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION,SPR 2014,2014,"Doctoral programs in the humanities and humanistic social sciences contend with relatively lower graduation rates and longer duration to degree. While reforming graduate education can include changes to financial aid awards and program requirements, enhancements in the area of advising can also improve student educational experiences and outcomes within existing institutional structures. The frequency of advisor-advisee communications during the dissertation process, as well as the advisor's attitude toward dissertation completion, influences program duration. Moreover, gender homophily, or same-gender mentorship, is associated with higher graduation probabilities for women doctoral students.",
The (In)compatibility of Diversity and Sense of Community,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,Mar 2014,2014,"Community psychologists are interested in creating contexts that promote both respect for diversity and sense of community. However, recent theoretical and empirical work has uncovered a community-diversity dialectic wherein the contextual conditions that foster respect for diversity often run in opposition to those that foster sense of community. More specifically, within neighborhoods, residential integration provides opportunities for intergroup contact that are necessary to promote respect for diversity but may prevent the formation of dense interpersonal networks that are necessary to promote sense of community. Using agent-based modeling to simulate neighborhoods and neighborhood social network formation, we explore whether the community-diversity dialectic emerges from two principles of relationship formation: homophily and proximity. The model suggests that when people form relationships with similar and nearby others, the contexts that offer opportunities to develop a respect for diversity are different from the contexts that foster a sense of community. Based on these results, we conclude with a discussion of whether it is possible to create neighborhoods that simultaneously foster respect for diversity and sense of community.",
Climate policies under wealth inequality,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Feb 11 2014,2014,"Taming the planet's climate requires cooperation. Previous failures to reach consensus in climate summits have been attributed, among other factors, to conflicting policies between rich and poor countries, which disagree on the implementation of mitigation measures. Here we implement wealth inequality in a threshold public goods dilemma of cooperation in which players also face the risk of potential future losses. We consider a population exhibiting an asymmetric distribution of rich and poor players that reflects the present-day status of nations and study the behavioral interplay between rich and poor in time, regarding their willingness to cooperate. Individuals are also allowed to exhibit a variable degree of homophily, which acts to limit those that constitute one's sphere of influence. Under the premises of our model, and in the absence of homophily, comparison between scenarios with wealth inequality and without wealth inequality shows that the former leads to more global cooperation than the latter. Furthermore, we find that the rich generally contribute more than the poor and will often compensate for the lower contribution of the latter. Contributions from the poor, which are crucial to overcome the climate change dilemma, are shown to be very sensitive to homophily, which, if prevalent, can lead to a collapse of their overall contribution. In such cases, however, we also find that obstinate cooperative behavior by a few poor may largely compensate for homophilic behavior.",
"UNPACKING THE BLACK BOX OF PEER SIMILARITY IN DEVIANCE: UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS LINKING PERSONAL BEHAVIOR, PEER BEHAVIOR, AND PERCEPTIONS",CRIMINOLOGY,Feb 2014,2014,"The strong correlation between measures of personal and peer deviance occurs with near law-like regularity. Yet, as with other manifestations of peer similarity (often referred to as homophily), the mechanisms generating this relationship are widely debated. Specific to the deviance literature, most studies have failed to examine, simultaneously, the degree to which similarity is the consequence of multiple causes. The current study addresses this gap by using longitudinal network data for 1,151 individuals from the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR) School Project. Structural equation modeling is used to address these issues by adapting Jussim and Osgood's () model of deviant attitudes in dyadic pairs to the current data. Across two separate behavioral domains (substance use and property offending), the results provide strong support for the prediction that individuals project their own deviant tendencies inaccurately onto their peers. Conversely, the results provide little or no support for the predictions that respondents accurately perceive their peers' deviance or that their perceptions of peer deviance influence their own behavior. Implications for understanding the role of peer behavior in the etiology of adolescent deviance are discussed.",
Thick as thieves: Homophily and trust among deviants,RATIONALITY AND SOCIETY,Feb 2014,2014,"Individuals who engage in deviant behaviors are more likely to be friends with other deviants compared to non-deviants. This pattern has been observed across different types of deviant activities and among different age groups. In question, however, is the mechanism that underlies this pattern. In this article we develop and test a new theory to explain homophily among deviants. Deviance makes one vulnerable to the risk of being caught and sanctioned. This vulnerability imposes a stringent constraint on deviants' choice of friends. Following Thomas Schelling, we conjecture that a way to establish trust consists of making oneself blackmailable by disclosing compromising information on one's misdeeds, or sharing compromising secrets (SCS). If two individuals share their illicit behaviors with one another, both are made vulnerable and a friendship can be established. We propose a series of hypotheses derived from SCS comparing levels of homophily in deviant and non-deviant behaviors. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health we estimate adolescents' preferences for deviant and non-deviant friends, within and across types of activities, and across different social contexts. Together, these tests allow us to distinguish between the theory we develop, SCS, and alternatives.",
The Differential Effects of Racially Homophilous Sponsorship Ties on Job Opportunities in an Elite Labor Market: The Case of NCAA Basketball Coaching,SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY,Feb 2014,2014,"We examine how an assistant coach's race and the race of his supervisor (the head coach) interact to affect future job quality. While past research argues that homophily is beneficial to job mobility, we find differential effects based on the race. OLS and OLR regression analyses on the quality of one's first head coaching job in NCAA men's basketball indicate that black assistant coaches working under black head coaches (black homophily) are significantly disadvantaged compared to all other racial combinations: white assistants with white supervisors (white homophily), white assistants with black supervisors (white heterophily), and black assistants with white supervisors (black heterophily). In contrast, there is no significant difference in job quality among the latter three groups: white homophily, white heterophily, and black heterophily. This indicates that while homophily is neither advantageous nor disadvantageous for whites, it is disadvantageous for black job candidates. This racially based disadvantage makes it difficult for minority job candidates to break through the glass ceiling and has real-world financial implications.",
Between friends: Making emotions intersubjectively,EMOTION SPACE AND SOCIETY,Feb 2014,2014,"Analysing qualitative interview material from a project on friendship and spatiality, this article examines the relationship between friendship, emotions and context. In the project's data the workplace emerged as a key site in which people meet new friends and practice friendships. Using the workplace as a case study, the article analyses how context can shape friendships, how emotions are woven throughout the very constitution of friendships, and how friendships can impact upon people's emotional experience of workplaces. Further, I analyse how emotions are actively generated between friends. In this understanding, emotions are not pre-existing states that are located in individuals; rather, emotions are created intersubjectively between friends and in specific contexts.

"Structural and diffusion effects in the Dutch fertility transition, 1870-1940",DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH,Jan 21 2014,2014,"BACKGROUNDEver since the Princeton European Fertility Project, structural and diffusion effects on fertility behavior have been juxtaposed. However, we still hardly know what the relative effects were of shifting socio-economic conditions and shifts in sociability in explaining the historical fertility decline.OBJECTIVETo what extent and how did structural and diffusion effects play a role in the adoption of fertility control in the Dutch historical fertility transition?METHODSA national data set was used with more than 3,000 maternity histories of married Dutch women aged 15-50, whose reproductive careers took place between 1870 and 1940. Apart from husbands. occupations, characteristics of the set of couples. marriage witnesses were included to measure their social networks. Cox regression analyses of age at last birth and negative binomial regressions of net family size were conducted.RESULTSResults indicate that unskilled laborers and farm laborers were laggards in the practice of fertility control during the Dutch fertility transition. Besides SES differentials, differences in couples. social networks were important in explaining fertility behavior. Those who had networks consisting of lateral kin, age peers, and people of urban background stopped childbearing earlier and had smaller families than other couples did. Particularly the presence of lateral kin of the bride and of female witnesses was strongly associated with smaller family size.CONCLUSIONSThe evidence lends support for so-called, blended diffusion models. and suggests that the fertility transition must be understood as much from the viewpoint of changed cost-benefit calculations related to structural changes, as from shifting patterns of sociability associated with the decline of patriarchy and the increasing lateralization and age homophily of people's social networks.",
The Effect of Online Social Network Characteristics on Consumer Purchasing Intention of Social Deals,GLOBAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,Jan 2 2014,2014,"AbstractThis study aims to understand how the characteristics of online social network structure can impact consumer purchase intention through network involvement.

The Effects of Social Anonymity on the Perception and Trust of Online Community: The Role of Perceived Homophily and Empathy,Journal of Cybercommunication Academic Society,2014,2014,"Anonymity has always been blamed as a negative characteristic of the online communication environment, while its positive function that facilitates individuals' voluntary communication remains largely overlooked. As an attempt to illuminate the positive aspect of anonymity, this study examines the effects of social anonymity on individuals' perception of and their trust to the community, and how such effects are formed through the mediation of empathy and perceived homophily. First, social anonymity was found to have a positive influence on perceived homophily, which in turn influenced the feeling of empathy, Second, the feeling of empathy and perceived homophily did influence respectively individuals' trust to and sense of the community, Also, social anonymity was found to have a significant effect directly on the trust level of the community. Discussion of the experimental findings and their theoretical implications for future research are followed.",
Student Athletes' Academic Advice and Friendship Network: Social Network Analysis,The Journal of Learner-Centered Curriculum and Instruction,2014,2014,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between student athletes' academic achievement and their social networks. Research questions were: (1) What are the network structure of physical education (PE) major students where student athlets are embedded., (2) What structural parameters are contributing to the PE majors network structure, and (3) Is there an association between student athletes' academic achievement and geodesic distance from the tutors shown in their network? Total of 95 college student (M= 78, F=17) majoring PE participated in this study where approximately half of them are student athletes. Data were collected using Name generator questionnaire. Students' grade point average (GPA) were also collected to analyze academic achievement. Data were analyzed using social network analysis tools such as UCINET, p-net(ERGM), and Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Network distance was calculated if association between geodesic distance and academic achievement exist. Results of this showed that (1) PE students showed three family under one roof where homophily was identified (2) homophily (e.g., student athletes, students with same sex) contributed to the total social network of PE majors, and (3) student athletes showed improvement in their GPA when they are interacting with tutors. Their GPA change is not attributed to the geodesic distance from student athletes to tutors.",
Homophily Among VAA Users Similarities and Differences of Node Attributes in a VAA-generated Social Network,2014 9TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC AND SOCIAL MEDIA ADAPTATION AND PERSONALIZATION (SMAP),2014,2014,"Users who successfully invited others to the EUvox 2014 online platform and users who accepted the invitation were used to form a network dataset. This report examines the tendency of Inviters and Invit-ees to be disproportionately similar with respect to their demographic, political orientation and attitudinal characteristics, i.e. examines the homophily hypothesis in VAA generated data. We find that Inviters were not more similar to their respective Invitees with regards to demographic and political identity attributes, beyond what would be expected by chance; on the contrary we find that the pairs held consistency more similar attitudes toward the policy items in a statistically significant manner.",
Using Rough Sets in Homophily Based Link Prediction in Online Social Networks,2014 WORLD CONGRESS ON COMPUTER APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (WCCAIS),2014,2014,"Online social networks are highly dynamic and sparse. One of the main problems in analyzing these networks is the problem of predicting the existence of links between users on these networks: Link prediction problem.

Identity Multipliers and the Mistaken Twittering of 'Birds of a Feather',PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON CYBER WARFARE AND SECURITY (ECCWS-2014),2014,2014,"New Media usage has expanded in unexpected directions. This qualitative study pulls together two new media phenomena that demonstrate widespread engineered influence through Twitter dispersion. The first aspect is the practice of sock-puppetry deception that occurs when social media identities are used without proof of identity. The relative ease in creating a single invented online identity is overshadowed by the more recent practise of harnessing thousands of created identities to accentuate the standing of a single identity. The second aspect is the use of metadata to fetch and find increased nodes of commonality. This promulgates the perception of connectivity and homogeneity in terms of information transfer. Identity masking in Twitter, and the use of homophily to manipulate authority, public sway, and social media deception are a formidable combination. This study considers the increasing use of sock-puppetry in conjunction with techniques that exploit homophily to sway the perceptions of others. The ethical and socio-political issues of identity deception and their subsequent impact are discussed. Using the publicly available Twitter accounts of six high profile political figures, the study compares retweets that retain metadata from original tweets. Using both real and fake accounts, the paper tests the hypothesis that non-genuine Sybil Twitter accounts are deployed in the followings of popular figures by using metadata in retweets to establish credibility amongst fake entities. New Media experiences augmented manipulation in multiple ways. The use of metatagging to expose greater commonality increases both the frequency and the amplitude of information diffusion when delivered through social networking and microblogging. A comparison of the associated tweets, followers, and retweets of high profile leaders indicate pervasive sock-puppetry and Sybil deception. With homophily embedded into Tweets and Retweets, sock puppetry in social media presents a challenge. Where homophily fits traditional notions of ""similarity between two nodes"", increasing the likelihood of likeness to occur is problematic. If homophily and false identity coalesce, then the use of twitter as a reliable social medium is contingent on discrete user identity in social media.",
Growing Self-organized Design of Efficient and Robust Complex Networks,2014 IEEE EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SELF-ADAPTIVE AND SELF-ORGANIZING SYSTEMS (SASO),2014,2014,"A self-organization of efficient and robust networks is important for a future design of communication or transportation systems, however both characteristics are incompatible in many real networks. Recently, it has been found that the robustness of onion-like structure with positive degree-degree correlations is optimal against intentional attacks. We show that, by biologically inspired copying, an onion-like network emerges in the incremental growth with functions of proxy access and reinforced connectivity on a space. The proposed network consists of the backbone of tree-like structure by copyings and the peripheral by adding shortcut links between low degree nodes to enhance the connectivity. It has the fine properties of the statistically self-averaging unlike the conventional duplication-divergence model, exponential-like degree distribution without overloaded hubs, strong robustness against both malicious attacks and random failures, and the efficiency with short paths counted by the number of hops as mediators and by the Euclidean distances. The adaptivity to heal over and to recover the performance of networking is also discussed for a change of environment in such disasters or battlefields on a geographical map. These properties will be useful for a resilient and scalable infrastructure of network systems even in emergent situations or poor environments.",
THE CAUSAL STATUS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL IN LABOR MARKETS,CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES ON ORGANIZATIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS,2014,2014,"Recent labor market research has called into question whether social capital effects are causal, or are spuriously due to the influence of social homophily. This essay adopts the demand-side perspective of organizations to examine the causal status of social capital. In contrast with supply-side approaches, we argue that homophily is a key mechanism by which organizations derive social capital. We develop an approach to bolster inferences about the causal status of social capital, and illustrate these ideas using data from a retail bank.",
A multi-agent Homophily-based-Approach for community detection in social networks,2014 IEEE 26TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ICTAI),2014,2014,"In this paper, we propose an agent-based approach for modeling dynamic connections in social networks. The key contribution of our work is the definition of a similarity measure for computing the strength of relationships between the social network members. For this purpose, we take into consideration the members' properties, the topological structure of the network and information about the interchange between each connected pair. To well choose the properties of social members, we use the concept of homophily. We show that our approach improves the effectiveness of the community detection process.",
Network size and network homophily: Same-sex friendships in 595 Scandinavian schools,ANALYTICAL SOCIOLOGY: ACTIONS AND NETWORKS,2014,2014,,
Gender Patterns in a Large Online Social Network,"SOCIAL INFORMATICS, SOCINFO 2014",2014,2014,"Gender differences in human social and communication behavior have long been observed in various contexts. This study investigates such differences in the case of online social networking. We find a general tendency towards gender homophily, more marked for women, however users having a large circle of friends tend to have more connections with users of the opposite gender. We also inspect the temporal sequences of adding new friends and find that females are much more likely to connect with other females as their initial friends. Through studying triangle motifs broken down by gender we detect a marked tendency of users to gender segregation, i.e. to form single gender groups; this phenomenon is more accentuated for male users.",
The Social Name-Letter Effect on Online Social Networks,"SOCIAL INFORMATICS, SOCINFO 2014",2014,2014,"The Name-Letter Effect states that people have a preference for brands, places, and even jobs that start with the same letter as their own first name. So Sam might like Snickers and live in Seattle. We use social network data from Twitter and Google+ to replicate this effect in a new environment. We find limited to no support for the Name-Letter Effect on social networks. We do, however, find a very robust Same-Name Effect where, say, Michaels would be more likely to link to other Michaels than Johns. This effect persists when accounting for gender, nationality, race, and age. The fundamentals behind these effects have implications beyond psychology as understanding how a positive self-image is transferred to other entities is important in domains ranging from studying homophily to personalized advertising and to link formation in social networks.",
Micro Strategies and Macro Patterns in the Evolution of Innovation Networks: An Agent-Based Simulation Approach,SIMULATING KNOWLEDGE DYNAMICS IN INNOVATION NETWORKS,2014,2014,"We focus on the evolution of interfirm innovation networks which are composed of and driven by heterogeneous actors that follow a number of well-defined cooperation partner selection strategies. For this purpose, we simulate micro level firm behaviour which shapes the macro level network patterns. In order to analyse the micro-macro link we build an agent-based simulation model (ABSM) which allows us to test causal relationships between firm strategies and the emerging network structures. With this model we analyse the structural consequences of homophily, reputation and cohesion mechanisms in a situation of information scarcity. We start with a simple model which is in a next step extended by adding a market mechanism which links the knowledge base of a firm with the reward a firm receives and with the incentives to cooperate. We show that (a) a transitive closure mechanism combined with a tendency for preferential attachment produces networks that show both, small world characteristics as well as a power law degree distribution; (b) diversity in the selection of cooperation partners is an important determinant of innovative performance if we consider an evolving network.",
Network formation between schools and community organization : Cooperation by homophily and mediation for structural holes,The Journal of Educational Administration,2014,2014,"This study, using the concept of structural holes and homophily, analysed a difference in cooperation with community organizations in respect of a school structure such as a designation of educational welfare school. This study found strong homophily among community welfare organizations except complex welfare facilities. We found a structural holes between schools and community organizations. We also demonstrated that Educational Welfare Center, imposed to mediate non-welfare schools and community organizations, performed successfully its tasks. From methodological perspective, this study went beyond describing network and made statistical inference using exponential random graph model.",
Friendship Recommendations in Online Social Networks,2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT NETWORKING AND COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS (INCOS),2014,2014,"Recommendation systems are popular both commercially and in the research community. For example, Online Social Networks (OSNs), like Twitter, are of special attention since a lot of connection are established between users without any previous knowledge. This highlights one of the key features of a lot of OSNs: the creation of relationships between users. Therefore, it is important to find new ways to provide interesting friendships suggestions.This work is the first step of an in-depth study whose goal is to find the right trade-offs between the number of factors explored in current state-of-the-art research. In particular, our contribution is an approach based on both Hubs And Authorities algorithm and similarity measures. The first one let us leverage triadic closures while the second one takes into account homophily. Even if the interplay between similarity and social ties is still an open issue in the analysis of OSNs, we lean towards the idea that it really counts.In order to support this hypothesis, a preliminary evaluation is performed on an implementation of the presented algorithm on datasets from Twitter. The deriving results show promising perspectives in terms of both effectiveness and scalability. These encouraging results are driving our future research efforts.",
Realistic Team Formation using Navigation and Homophily,2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND SMART COMPUTING (BIGCOMP),2014,2014,"This paper proposes an algorithm for selecting a team of experts from a social network, which is represented by a weighted undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents an individual who has one or more skills. We introduce the concept of realistic team formation and its associated constraints and assumptions. The main constraint is a local view of the network resulting in an absence of pre-computed network statistics. Nodes in the network are assumed to connect to people with whom they share common skills. Thus, this paper proposes a navigation based team formation algorithm that makes use of homophily to recruit candidates for the team. The objective is to create an effective team that can carry out a specific task. Since none of the related work has had a local view of the network, we use BfsRecruiter, a BFS based navigation algorithm as our baseline comparison. We implemented the proposed algorithm and ran many simulation experiments to measure the communication cost and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",
A Privacy Settings Recommender System for Online Social Networks,2014 RECENT ADVANCES AND INNOVATIONS IN ENGINEERING (ICRAIE),2014,2014,"There is a rapid growth in the Online Social Networks (OSNs) in recent years. Privacy settings in OSNs provide its users an option to control their online data sharing but managing the privacy settings is a confusing and a time consuming task and hence there is a need for a system that could measure and compare the privacy settings of the target users and help them to customize their privacy settings. In this paper we have proposed a context based personalized privacy settings recommender system. We have used homophily to group the target user's friends according to a context (context based) and collaborative filtering mechanism to quantify the user's profile privacy to provide meaningful recommendations with respect to their friend list (personalized). We have validated our solution using the data extracted from Facebook for the objects like the photos, videos, notes and links shared by target users and their friends.",
Ethnic Diversity and Its Effects on Social Cohesion,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY, VOL 40",2014,2014,"Recent years have seen a sharp increase in empirical studies on the constrict claim: the hypothesized detrimental effect of ethnic diversity on most if not all aspects of social cohesion. Studies have scrutinized effects of different measures of ethnic heterogeneity in different geographical areas on different forms of social cohesion. The result has been a cacophony of empirical findings. We explicate mechanisms likely to underlie the negative relationship between ethnic heterogeneity and social cohesion: the homophily principle, feelings of anomie, group threat, and social disorganization. Guided by a clear conceptual framework, we structure the empirical results of 90 recent studies and observe three patterns. We find that (a) there is consistent support for the constrict claim for aspects of social cohesion that are spatially bounded to neighborhoods, (b) support for the constrict claim is more common in the United States than in other countries, and (c) ethnic diversity is not related to less interethnic social cohesion. We discuss the implications of these patterns.",
Factors enhancing word-of-mouth influence: positive and negative service-related messages,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING,2014,2014,"Purpose - This study aims to examine the effects interpersonal, service product and message factors has on positive and negative word of mouth's (WOM) influence. The study also sought to address the impact WOM had on changes in people's willingness to use a service provider.Design/methodology/approach - A total of 495 consumers who had received positive WOM and 505 who had received negative WOM in the prior 12 months completed an online survey. The sample was recruited through a national online consumer panel provider.Findings - Positive WOM was more effective and positive WOM messages had a greater effect on people's willingness to use a service than did negative WOM. Paradoxically, the strength of WOM and interpersonal factors had more impact on the influence of negative WOM, while brand equity enhanced positive WOM and acted as a buffer to negative WOM.Research limitations/implications - The study was conducted in a services context and may not necessarily be generalizable to product contexts. Further, the factors enhancing WOM in online contexts need to be examined, although the present model's constructs (e.g. homophily) are not equivalent in this context.Practical implications - Different circumstances may enhance or detract from the influence of positive and negative WOM. Managers should maximise the verbal strength of positive WOM messages and generate positive brand equity perceptions, as this offers a buffer to negative WOM. Recommendations also include addressing customer education and socialisation to enhance WOM message influence.Originality/value - The study extended prior WOM research by addressing interpersonal, service product and message factors, as well as the change in intended behaviour for positive and negative WOM.",
Young people's preferences for social interaction in terms of homophily and social inclusion: a critical discussion about respect,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION,2014,2014,"This paper reports findings from a study about young people's preferences for social interaction with similar and different others, in terms of a tension between social inclusion and homophily - the concept that similarity breeds connection. The issue was explored empirically using moral dilemmas scenarios to conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with young people with Asperger syndrome, visual impairment and without disabilities. The data indicates that homophily and inclusion can come into a tension with an ethical dimension, since they represent, respectively, a personal preference to be among similar others and the moral imperative of including all people. The paper argues that this tension is constructive as it can challenge our understanding of what the ethical obligation to inclusion entails, and what treating the students respectfully means. Respect is often seen as an attempt to avoid the humiliation that any kind of recognition of difference can bring, and has tended to be translated into a demand for inclusion for all. However, the recognition of difference is an acknowledgement of young people's right to make their own decisions, and can be reflected in provision and translated into educational and life opportunities; as such, it is also an expression of respect. Negotiating a way between the two understandings through dialogue can ensure that inclusion would be a shared value.",
Conceptual mindsets and heuristics in credibility evaluation of e-Word of Mouth in tourism,ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW,2014,2014,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find out how credibility judgements intervene in the consumption of electronic-Word of Mouth (e-WOM) in tourism, as there is discrepancy in the literature about its influence on decision-making processes.Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach is explored, based on semi-structured interviews and observation through think-aloud protocol. This methodology provides fruitful insights as it focuses on the users' browsing habits. The author interviewed a sample of professionals of tourism, cybertourists and bloggers.Findings - Results reveal that only part of e-WOM is granted credibility. Therefore, its persuasiveness depends on those limited positive judgements. Travellers use a conceptual mindset and a series of cognitive heuristics (homophily, crowd consensus, etc.) to assess credibility. Formal knowledge background and social pressures have proven to be weak.Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to a reduced sample of informants but their adjustment to the most typical profiles interviewed compensates this restriction. Another limitation is that data comes from a single cultural context (Spain), but on the other hand provides data that did not exist in the international literature on the topic.Practical implications - Outcomes can help tourism managers to monitor key heuristics employed by end-users in webs of e-WOM and detect new trends of travelling habits.Originality/value - The paper is original in that it establishes the rationalities behind the daily use of cognitive heuristics explored through different traveller's profiles.",
Collaborative Friendship Networks in Online Healthcare Communities: An Exponential Random Graph Model Analysis,"SMART HEALTH, ICSH 2014",2014,2014,"Health 2.0 provides patients an unprecedented way to connect with each other online. However, less attention has been paid to how patient collaborative friendships form in online healthcare communities. This study examines the relationship between collaborative friendship formation and patients' characteristics. Results from Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) analysis indicate that gender homophily doesn't appear in CFNs, while health homophily such as treatments homophily and health-status homophily increases the likelihood of collaborative friendship formation. This study provides insights for improving website design to help foster close relationship among patients and deepen levels of engagement.",
A Study on the Social Network Characteristics in Press Organizations of Korea,Korean Journal of Communication & Information,2014,2014,"This study analyzes the characteristics, implications, and problems of Social Network of Press Organizations from the Kim Dae-jung administration to the Lee Myung-bak administration in Korea. For analyzing these issues, this study attempts to investigate the traits of social network structure based on the density analysis, distribution character analysis and correspondence analysis in each and among regimes. To answer these questions, this study utilizes human relationship data which related to personal network aspects (place of birth, affiliated college) and expertise aspects (types of major field), and which data has been gathered from the biographical web-site of Press Organizations in Korea.The results showed that the membership format of each Press Organizations depends on the connection with political environment directly and indirectly. Especially, the network traits of Broadcasting Press Organizations stands out a place of birth aspect. This findings indicate that the broadcasting policy reality that the path of decision making is connected with the political environment is more effective.",
Social Search,"WEB ENGINEERING, ICWE 2014",2014,2014,"Social Search refers to two aspects of the integration of web search with social networks: how queries to a search engine may surface (socially) relevant content from social networks, and how signals from social networks may influence the (personalized) ranking of search results. The first part of the talk surveys the integration of Bing with Facebook, Twitter, Quora, Foursquare, LinkedIn, Klout, and other social platforms. The second part focuses on two technical details of this integration: a measure for quantifying the ""affinity"" between two users of a social network and an efficient algorithm for computing that measure, and a method for efficiently surfacing pages ""liked"" by your friends from a document-sharded index. The final part discusses limitations of social search, such as skewed demographics and weak homophily.",
Exploring political discussions by Korean twitter users A look at opinion leadership and homophily phenomenon,ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,2014,2014,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a network analysis of Twitter discussions about Myung-Bak Lee, a former president of South Korea, to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the public opinion exchange on Twitter.Design/methodology/approach - Opinion leaders in the discussion network were identified by considering the longitudinal distribution of tweets containing the former president's name, and three types of messages (""followings,"" ""mentions,"" and ""retweets"") were analyzed using data collected from November 1, 2011, to April 20, 2012. The sample included 26,150 Twitter users and 892,034 relationships reflecting three types of messages.Findings - The results indicate that the discussion about President Myung-Bak Lee was dominated by liberal Twitter users who already had considerable influence both online and offline. In addition, Twitter users were unlikely to interact with other users with opposing political views.Research limitations/implications - Almost all of the opinion leaders identified in the study held liberal political views, and liberal Twitter users dominated the discussion network. In addition, the Korean Twitter network showed the presence of the homophily phenomenon, implying that opinion leaders' influence within the Twitter network was limited to other users sharing the same political views. Further, political views of opinion leaders were skewed toward a particular political stance without necessarily representing the opinion of the general public, possibly hindering the democratic process.Originality/value - This study tests the homophily thesis in the context of Twitter users in Korea and contributes to the literature on Twitter-based political discourse by identifying opinion leaders in Korean Twitter networks and examining the phenomenon of homophily within those networks.",
Fuzzy Concepts in Small Worlds and the Identification of Leaders in Social Networks,"INFORMATION PROCESSING AND MANAGEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY IN KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS, PT II",2014,2014,"In the study of the Social Networks, the Small World phenomenon appears frequently. We apply some techniques of graph theory and fuzzy sets to characterize the Small World features as well as the existence of the figure of leader in Social Networks. These techniques help to the conceptual formalization in relational networks analysis, by transforming linguistic and human-focused manner concepts related to social networks in some formal representation. These techniques are also applied when the similarity among nodes wants to be measured in order to study the current homophily present in a Network.",
Trust and the cultivation of relation-specific skills. Evidence from a multinational automotive supplier in Japan and Germany,MANAGEMENT DECISION,2014,2014,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw on Asanuma's concept of relation-specific skills in order to analyse collaboration between automaker and supplier. The cultivation of relation-specific skills has been widely regarded a key factor of competitiveness in the Japanese automotive industry. Yet, the concept has been described mostly in economic terms only. This research attempts to extend this view by analysing the role of informal institutions (trust) in developing relation-specific skills.Design/methodology/approach - By drawing on expert interview data, evaluated by using content analysis, within the frame of a case study research approach, the authors gathered data from the leading multinational automotive supplier Bosch in its facilities in Japan and Germany.Findings - The results show that the influence of trust plays a role in determining relation-specific skills. In conclusion, the authors assume that cultural homophily positively influences the cultivation of relation-specific skills and recommend future research to take this assumption into account.Practical implications - Findings imply that over the course of business transactions organisational structures hardly converge leading to higher transaction cost. Moreover, Keiretsu structures are still strong in the field of automotive electronics.Originality/value - So far the concept of relation-specific skills has been regarded a ""culture-free"" concept. The results provide a first indication that cultural differences affect the cultivation of relation specific skill, and thus need to be considered integral to the concept.",
Social Media at SocioSystems Inc.: A Socio-technical Systems Analysis of Strategic Action,2014 47TH HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES (HICSS),2014,2014,"In this study, we present preliminary results from case research at a global IT firm with demonstrable success in the strategic use of social media. From the theoretical underpinnings of interest-based homophily, action theory, and social movement theory, we propose a conceptual framework and analytics to consider the question ""how can organizations motivate strategic directed action from participants within social media to accomplish organizational goals?"" We discuss the theories of interest-based homophilies to identify and explain how organizations can develop information-based analytics appropriate to motivate strategic action in social media using similar approaches to those utilized by social movement and social movement framing. There has been little theorizing on the nature and structuration of social media from which appropriate directed action can be strategically conceptualized. This paper presents novel theoretical foundations from which to understand social media and develop effective strategies to advance organizational interests.",
Interactions Around Social Networks Matter: Predicting the social network from associated interaction networks,2014 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2014),2014,2014,"Tie formation in social networks is driven by different motives that are not always apparent in the social network itself. These motives differ from one social network to another, depending on, e.g., the network's purpose, such as advice seeking or collaboration, and the effort it costs to establish a friendship relationship. A common factor that exists in almost all social networks is homophily: the tendency of social network members to connect to similar members. In this work, we look at the tie formation process in social networks from a different perspective where we consider not only a social network SN, but also a set of associated interaction networks G(n) around it. We show, based on 6 social networks and in total 20 different associated interaction networks, that it is possible to predict the entire social network's structure to a satisfactory extent, only by knowing the structure of these interaction networks. As social networks are based on a voluntary relationship while some of the interaction relationships are at most semi-controllable for most members, e.g., being together in a team, this seems to indicate that whom we choose as a friend is also determined by whom we interact with.",
Two Phase Transitions in the Adaptive Voter Model based on the Homophily Principle,2014 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2014),2014,2014,"Dynamics on and of networks are two basic processes that drive coevolving networks such as online social networks. The paper investigates the mechanism of coevolving networks using a generalized adaptive voter model based on related work and the homophily principle which is known as a driving mechanism to form community structure in social networks. The proposed model has mechanisms for dynamics on and of coevolving networks, which are node state change via social interactions and link rewiring based on homophily. The numerical simulation of the proposed model reveals that there exists two phase transitions for the parameters adaptability and homophily. This observation implies that the nature of the homophily principle lies in the adaptive mechanism in the proposed model.",
Same Wavelength Group Identification from Online Social Networks: A General Framework,COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Jan 2014,2014,"Reacting to social issues or events through Online Social Networks has become a social habit. Social scientists have identified several network relationships and dimensions that induce homophily. Sentiments or opinions towards different issues have been observed as a key dimension which characterizes human behaviour. People usually express their sentiments towards various issues. Different persons from different walks of social life may share same opinion towards various issues. When these persons constitute a group, such groups can be conveniently termed same wavelength groups. We propose a novel framework based on sentiments and an algorithm to identify such same wavelength groups from online social networks like twitter. The proposed algorithm generates same wavelength groups in polynomial time for relatively small set of events. The analysis of such groups would be of help in unravelling their response patterns and behavioural features.",
"Understanding the Effects of MTV's 16 and Pregnant on Adolescent Girls' Beliefs, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intentions Toward Teen Pregnancy",JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2014,2014,"This article examines the impact of a popular documentary series about teen pregnancy, MTV's 16 and Pregnant, on adolescent girls' pregnancy-related attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions. The results suggest that girls who watched 16 and Pregnant, compared with a control group, reported a lower perception of their own risk for pregnancy and a greater perception that the benefits of teen pregnancy outweigh the risks. The authors also examined the relationships between homophily and parasocial interaction with the teen moms featured in 16 and Pregnant and attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions, finding that homophily predicted lower risk perceptions, greater acceptance of myths about teen pregnancy, and more favorable attitudes about teen pregnancy. Parasocial interaction demonstrated the same pattern of results, with the addition of also predicting fewer behavioral intentions to avoid teen pregnancy. Last, results revealed that teen girls' perceptions that the message of 16 and Pregnant was encouraging of teen pregnancy predicted homophily and parasocial interaction with the teen moms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",
Consumer perceptions of salesperson gender and credibility: an evolutionary explanation,JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING,2014,2014,"Purpose - The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of the homophily theory and the related concept of source similarity which predict that a male salesperson is more effective in serving male customers, and a female is more effective with females. For products designed to enhance female attractiveness, however, Darwinian theories of reproduction suggest that a male may be more effective than a female in dealing with female customers. This study of Hong Kong consumers examined the possibility and, in doing so, challenged the assumed utility of homophily in selling cosmetics.Design/methodology/approach - Two studies were conducted. The first was an experiment where female subjects were asked to report their responses to female and male salespersons selling cosmetics. The second study was a phenomenological study exploring the responses of female customers who had encountered male salespeople in cosmetics shops.Findings - The experiment found that a male salesperson tended to induce significantly stronger purchase intention than a female, and that salesperson credibility (specifically, trustworthiness and attractiveness) plays a significant role in mediating the impact of salesperson gender on purchase intention. The follow-up phenomenological study of female customers who had encountered male salespeople in cosmetics shops supported the experimental findings and offered additional support for their evolutionary basis.Research limitations/implications - Darwinian theories of reproduction and source credibility together offer a more complete explanation for the effectiveness of salespeople in the gender-sensitive cosmetics market. However, the experiment involved creating fictitious salespeople matched for trust, expertise and attractiveness. The artificiality of the treatments was necessary to construct a controlled scenario to uphold internal validity, but it may limit the generalizability of the results.Practical implications - To encourage a positive consumer response, retailers need to consider salesperson gender and training. In some specific contexts (such as the selling of products designed to enhance female attractiveness), male salespeople ought to be used ahead of female salespeople, and those male salespeople need to have high credibility to be effective. However, as such, salesmen may not be seen as more expert than saleswomen; expertise needs to be an area of focus in terms of salesperson training.Originality/value - The results of previous research testing homophily theory suggest that a salesperson of the same gender as the customer ought to induce stronger purchase intentions. This study has shown that for the selling of appearance-related products, gender heterophily may be more effective than homophily. Darwinian interpretations of intrasexual rivalry and courtship might help explain why males sell cosmetics more effectively.",
Understanding news sharing in social media An explanation from the diffusion of innovations theory,ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW,2014,2014,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw from the diffusion of innovations theory to explore multi-levels of influences (i.e. individuals, networks, news attributes) on news sharing in social media.Design/methodology/approach - A survey was designed and administered to 309 respondents. Structural equation modelling analysis was conducted to examine the three levels of influential factors. These included self-perceptions of opinion leadership and seeking at the individual level, perceived tie strength and homophily at the network level, and finally, perceived news credibility and news preference at the news attribute level.Findings - The results revealed that the influences of self-perceptions of opinion leadership, perceived tie strength in online networks and perceived preference of online news had significant effects on users' news sharing intention in social media. However, self-perceptions of opinion seeking, homophily, and perceived news credibility were not significant.Originality/value - This is one of the first studies on news sharing in social media that focus on diverse levels of influential factors. In particular, the research suggests the viability of the diffusion of innovations theory to explain this pervasive global phenomenon. Further, the influential factors identified may help to stimulate active participation in social media platforms and ultimately enhance the sustainability of these platforms.",
Networks of Contention: The Shape of Online Transnationalism in Early Twenty-First Century Social Movement Coalitions,SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES,2014,2014,"The study of new media use by transnational social movements is central to contemporary investigations of social contention. In order to shed light on the terrain in which the most recent examples of online mobilization have grown and developed, this paper combines the interest in the transnational dynamics of social contention and the exploration of the use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) for protest action. In specific terms, the study investigates how early twenty-first century social movement coalitions used Internet tools to build symbolically transnational collective identities. By applying a hyperlink network analysis approach, the study focuses on a website network generated by local chapters of the World Social Forum (WSF), one of the earliest social movement coalitions for global justice. The sample network, selected through snowball sampling, is composed of 222 social forum websites from around the world. The study specifically looks at hyperlinks among social forum websites as signs of belonging and potential means of alliance. The analysis uses network measures, namely of cohesion, centrality, structural equivalence and homophily, to test dynamics of symbolic collective identification underlying the WSF coalition. The findings show that in early twenty-first century transnational contention, culture and place still played a central role in the emergence of transnational movement networks.",
Relationship between employees' performance and social network structure An empirical research based on a SME from a whole-network perspective,CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES,2014,2014,"Purpose - The aim of this paper, considering the two types of networks and the scope of power from structural holes, is to clarify the relationship between employees' performance and their social network structure in Chinese small and medium enterprises from the whole-network perspective. The complicated relationship in Chinese culture requires human resource management (HRM) practitioners to be aware of the implications of social network.Design/methodology/approach - An empirical research approach is used in this paper. Using the cluster sampling method, authors collected 118 employees' characteristic data and network data by face-to-face interviews through structured questionnaire survey, and also got their performance data from the financial department, which support correlation analysis and OLS regression analysis.Findings - First, informal network, but not formal network, has a significant impact on employees' performance. Second, individual performance of brokerage is greater for direct than indirect contacts. Finally, broker-of-brokers will be the winner in the competition.Originality/value - First, previous research focuses on egocentric network as the difficulty of data collection, while this paper analyzes a whole network based on the real social network. Second, this paper reveals the network structure mode where individuals get benefits. Third, it also uncovers the effect of relationship type on employees' performance in Chinese SME. Finally, this paper identifies the status homophily and status crystallization phenomenon in the process of social network formation.",
An Integrated Model of Information Processing of eWOM in Social Network Service,Advertising Research,2014,2014,"The purpose of this study is to examine the integrated model of information processingof eWOM in SNS. This study suggested and tested that an integrated model ofinformation processing model of eWOM in SNS composed of three characteristics ofSNS senders as antecedents(tie strength, homophily, expertise), two intermediatingvariables including two characteristics of SNS receivers(instrumentality on eWOMinformation in SNS, usage experience of eWOM on SNS), and three result variablesincluding three characteristics of eWOM information in SNS(consensus, vividness, andneutrality). The results of structural equation model analysis found that threecharacteristics of SNS senders(tie strength, homophily, expertise), twocharacteristics of SNS receivers(instrumentality on eWOM information in SNS, usageexperience of eWOM on SNS), and three characteristics of eWOM information inSNS(consensus, vividness, and neutrality) had positive effects on acceptance anddiffusion of eWOM information in SNS and purchasing influence via credibility andusefulness of eWOM information in SNS. Therefore, it turned out that credibility andusefulness of eWOM information in SNS played important roles as mediating variablesin the causal relationship between ad cognitions and brand attitude, which in turnresulted in purchase intention. This study has both theoretical and practicalimplications by suggesting the integrated model of information processing of eWOMin SNS. Specifically, the result of this study help develop marketing strategies usingthe Buzz marketing as well as reviewsumer.",
Relative Political and Value Proximity in Mediated Public Diplomacy: The Effect of State-Level Homophily on International Frame Building,POLITICAL COMMUNICATION,2014,2014,"This article applies the homophily thesis to public diplomacy and offers an empirical examination of a country's success in its mediated public diplomacy efforts. It analyzes international frame building, the process of creating or changing media frames in the international communications arena, by applying it to the case of Israeli mediated public diplomacy efforts during the war in Gaza in the winter of 2008-2009. The article claims that one way to use the homophily thesis in empirical analyses of international frame-building campaigns in conflicts is to measure the political and value proximity of a country promoting frames to other countries. Yet, proximity should be measured relatively rather than in absolute terms. Therefore, one should look not only at the dyadic proximity between two actors (i.e., Country A that attempts to promote its frames to Country C), but at the relative proximity between Countries A and C considering the proximity between the rival Country B and the target Country C. The study proposes a model and a method to facilitate empirical analysis of this claim. Using sophisticated computerized content analysis, our analyses demonstrate that relative proximity is related to successful international frame building in the hypothesized direction: The closer the relative proximity between Israel and a foreign country, the greater the acceptance of Israel's views.",
"Lethal Connections: The Determinants of Network Connections in the Provisional Irish Republican Army, 1970-1998",INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS,Jan 1 2014,2014,"Using stochastic methods we illustrate that the Provisional Irish Republican Army's (PIRA) network is clustered along three primary dimensions: (a) brigade affiliation, (b) whether the member participated in violent activities, and (c) task/role within PIRA. While most brigades tended to foster connections within the brigade (that is, ""closure""), the tendency to do so varied across the organization. Members who engaged with violent activities were far more likely to connect with each other; in later periods there is polarization into those who engage in violent activities and those who do not. Across brigades, those who engage in a particular task and role (improvised explosive device [IED] constructor, IED planter, gunman, robber/kidnapper/drug smuggler/hijacker) are more likely to connect with others who do the same task or play the same role than with other members who fulfill other roles. Standard forms of homophily (that is, the tendency to make connections with people who are similar in terms of demography or status) play a very weak role in explaining which members interact with one another. Finally, our analysis illustrates clear patterns of relational change that correspond to changes in the formal structures that PIRA's leadership promoted.",
Predicting Individual Behavior with Social Networks,MARKETING SCIENCE,JAN-FEB 2014,2014,"With the availability of social network data, it has become possible to relate the behavior of individuals to that of their acquaintances on a large scale. Although the similarity of connected individuals is well established, it is unclear whether behavioral predictions based on social data are more accurate than those arising from current marketing practices. We employ a communications network of over 100 million people to forecast highly diverse behaviors, from patronizing an off-line department store to responding to advertising to joining a recreational league. Across all domains, we find that social data are informative in identifying individuals who are most likely to undertake various actions, and moreover, such data improve on both demographic and behavioral models. There are, however, limits to the utility of social data. In particular, when rich transactional data were available, social data did little to improve prediction.",
Reliability of testimonial norms in scientific communities,SYNTHESE,Jan 2014,2014,"Several current debates in the epistemology of testimony are implicitly motivated by concerns about the reliability of rules for changing one's beliefs in light of others' claims. Call such rules testimonial norms (tns). To date, epistemologists have neither (i) characterized those features of communities that influence the reliability of tns, nor (ii) evaluated the reliability of tns as those features vary. These are the aims of this paper. I focus on scientific communities, where the transmission of highly specialized information is both ubiquitous and critically important. Employing a formal model of scientific inquiry, I argue that miscommunication and the ""communicative structure"" of science strongly influence the reliability of tns, where reliability is made precise in three ways.",
Chimps of a feather sit together: chimpanzee friendships are based on homophily in personality,EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jan 2014,2014,"Several recent studies show that animal friendships, like human friendships, are durable and have fitness benefits by increasing survival, infant survival, or reproductive success. However, the determinants of especially non-kin friendships are unclear. Human non-kin friendships are partly determined by similarity in personality. We investigated personality similarity of friends in 38 captive chimpanzees. Within-subject comparisons revealed that friends are more similar than non-friends in their Sociability and Boldness. Subsequent analyses, including both kin- and non-kin dyads, revealed higher similarity in Sociability among all individuals who sat in contact more often, while in Boldness and Grooming Equity the positive effect of similarity was only found in non-kin individuals' contact-sitting. Our results show that similar to humans, chimpanzees' friendships are related to homophily in certain personality characteristics, particularly those relevant for socio-positive and cooperative behaviour. We suggest that having friends similar to self in personality decreases uncertainty in interactions by promoting reliability especially in cooperative contexts, and is consequently adaptive. Further, we suggest that homophily in human friendships dates back at least to our last common ancestor with chimpanzees. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Enhancing decentralized service discovery in open service-oriented multi-agent systems,AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS,Jan 2014,2014,"Service-oriented multi-agent systems are dynamic systems that are populated by heterogeneous agents. These agents model their functionality as services in order to allow heterogeneous agents or other entities to interact with each other in a standardized way. Furthermore, due to the large-scale and adaptative needs of the system, traditional directory facilitators or middle-agents are not suitable for the management of agent services. This article proposes the introduction of homophily in service-oriented multi-agent systems to create efficient decentralized and self-organized structures where agents have a greater probability of establishing links with similar agents than with dissimilar ones. This similarity is based on two social dimensions: the set of services that an agent provides and the organizational roles that it plays. A second contribution is an algorithm for service discovery that it is carried out taking into account the local information that is related to the homophily between agents. The experiments compare our proposal with other proposals in distributed environments. The results show that the proposed structure and algorithm offer desirable features for service discovery in decentralized environments. Specifically, these features provide short paths and a high success rate in the service discovery process and resilience under deliberate failures.",
Lock-in or lock-out? How structural properties of knowledge networks affect regional resilience,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,Jan 2014,2014,"This article develops an evolutionary framework of regional resilience with a primary focus on the structural properties of local knowledge networks. After presenting the network-based rationales of growth and structuring of clusters, we analyze under which structural conditions a regional cluster can achieve short-run competitiveness without compromising long-run resilience capabilities. We show that the properties of degree distribution (the level of hierarchy) and degree correlation (the level of structural homophily) of regional knowledge networks should be studied to understand how clusters succeed in combining technological lock-in with regional lock-out. We propose simple statistical measures of cluster structuring to highlight these properties and discuss the results in a policy-oriented analysis. We conclude showing that policies for regional resilience should focus on ex-ante regional diagnosis and targeted interventions on particular missing links, rather than ex-postmyopic applications of policies based on an unconditional increase of network relational density.",
Multiplex networks and interest group influence reputation: An exponential random graph model,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2014,2014,"Interest groups struggle to build reputations as influential actors in the policy process and to discern the influence exercised by others. This study conceptualizes influence reputation as a relational variable that varies locally throughout a network. Drawing upon interviews with 168 interest group representatives in the United States health policy domain, this research examines the effects of multiplex networks of communication, coalitions, and issues on influence reputation. Using an exponential random graph model (ERGM), the analysis demonstrates that multiple roles of confidant, collaborator, and issue advocate affect how group representatives understand the influence of those with whom they are tied, after accounting for homophily among interest groups.

The evolution and formation of amicus curiae networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2014,2014,"This paper sheds light on two age-old questions of interest group behavior: how have interest group coalition strategies changed over time and which factors determine whether interest groups work together? Through the creation of a new network measure of interest group coalitions based on cosigner status to United States Supreme Court amicus curiae briefs, we illuminate the central players and overall characteristics of this dynamic network from 1930 to 2009. We present evidence of an increasingly transitive network resembling a host of tightly grouped factions and leadership hub organizations employing mixed coalition strategies. We also model the attribute homophily and structure of the present-day network. We find assortative mixing of interest groups based on industry area, budget, sales and membership.

Collective Prediction of Multiple Types of Links in Heterogeneous Information Networks,2014 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),2014,2014,"Link prediction has become an important and active research topic in recent years, which is prevalent in many real-world applications. Current research on link prediction focuses on predicting one single type of links, such as friendship links in social networks, or predicting multiple types of links independently. However, many real-world networks involve more than one type of links, and different types of links are not independent, but related with complex dependencies among them. In such networks, the prediction tasks for different types of links are also correlated and the links of different types should be predicted collectively. In this paper, we study the problem of collective prediction of multiple types of links in heterogeneous information networks. To address this problem, we introduce the linkage homophily principle and design a relatedness measure, called RM, between different types of objects to compute the existence probability of a link. We also extend conventional proximity measures to heterogeneous links. Furthermore, we propose an iterative framework for heterogeneous collective link prediction, called HCLP, to predict multiple types of links collectively by exploiting diverse and complex linkage information in heterogeneous information networks. Empirical studies on real-world tasks demonstrate that the proposed collective link prediction approach can effectively boost link prediction performances in heterogeneous information networks.",
"Alike People, Alike Interests? A Large-scale Study on Interest Similarity in Social Networks",2014 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2014),2014,2014,"This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the correlations between users' interest similarity and various social features across three interest domains (i.e., movie, music and TV). This study relies on a large dataset, containing 479, 048 users and 5, 263, 351 user-generated interests, captured from Facebook. We identify the social features from three types of the users' information - demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), social relations (i.e., friendship), and users' interests. The results reveal that the interest similarity follows the homophily principle. Particularly, the results show that two users are more likely to be alike in their interests 1) if they exhibit more similarity in their demographic characteristics (e.g., similar age, same gender, or close to each other geographically), or 2) if they are more intimate in their friendship, or 3) if they present a higher average interest individuality (i.e., a measurement for estimating the personalized characteristics of a user's interests). The empirical observations could be exploited to infer how two users are alike in their interests according to the social features, which could be further harnessed by various practical applications and services, such as recommendation system and advertisement service.",
Opinion Dynamics of Skeptical Agents,AAMAS'14: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTONOMOUS AGENTS & MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS,2014,2014,"How does skepticism affect opinion formation in networks? In many settings, agents exhibit skepticism in the presence of people whose beliefs radically different from their own, and they are reluctant to be persuaded by such individuals. We present a model of opinion dynamics where agents are receptive toward other agents that have similar opinions, but remain skeptical of agents holding disparate opinions. We analyze how agents with extreme opinions affect the general population, using simulations on Barabasi-Albert random graphs, and modified Erdos-Renyi random graphs that incorporate homophily. Finally, we show that even skeptical agents are able to come to an early consensus and take coordinated action to reach a final opinion in most settings; but, agents in homophilic networks may fail to converge to a single opinion. Paradoxically, this happens when agents are least skeptical, and are able to stabilize themselves by balancing influence from extremists from opposing camps.",
Political Homophily on the Web,ANALYSING SOCIAL MEDIA DATA AND WEB NETWORKS,2014,2014,,
GENDERED NETWORKS: PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING FACULTY,GENDER TRANSFORMATION IN THE ACADEMY,2014,2014,"Purpose - Gender differences in professional networks are said to explain disparities in career success and satisfaction in academia - particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines - yet little empirical research examines men and women's satisfaction with networks. This study investigated gender differences in networks and network satisfaction among STEM faculty, examining gender differences in network size and density and in satisfaction with networks.Methods - A web-based survey was administered to full-time tenured and tenure-track STEM faculty members at a major research university. Participants (N=141) were queried about their network ties within the home department, outside the department but within the home university, and beyond the home university.Findings - Faculty networks tended to be gender homophilous, with men reporting more ties with men and women reporting more ties with women. Women reported having networks as large and supportive as men's reported networks, yet women reported significantly less satisfaction with their networks than did men. Women in departments with a critical mass of women faculty (15% or more) reported greater satisfaction with opportunities to collaborate with departmental colleagues.Limitations - This research was confined to a single university and did not focus on negative interactions in networks, which may affect network satisfaction.Implications - These findings argue for increasing women's representation in university departments to above 15% and providing assistance to women in STEM departments without critical mass to ensure that they have adequate opportunities to collaborate in research.",
Is the Political Communication in Social Network Sites Homophilous?,Korean Journal of Broadcasting and Telecommunication Studies,2014,2014,"Focusing on the difference between SNS network and offline social network interms of the political homophily, this study attempted to empirically examine theecho-chamber hypothesis of SNS communication. Survey data gathered from377 Korean college students were analyzed to identify to what extent thepolitical communication on social network services is homophilous. For thepurpose of conceptual comparison with the political homophily variable, twoother variables, “Political heterophily” and “Conversation activeness” were alsomeasured. This study found that all the three mean scores of SNScommunication (the perceived political homophily, heterophily andconversation activeness) were lower than those of the offline communication.Even though the results seems to be a little bit equivocal, it is clear that the resultsdo not support the echo-chamber effect on the SNS communication.",
DIFFERENCE AND SOCIAL IDENTITY,PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUCCESSFULLY DOING DIFFERENCE IN ORGANIZATIONS,2014,2014,"Now well into the 21st century, the world's most powerful organizations' highest executive levels and boards of directors still fail to represent a diverse collection of people shaped by unique social identity dimensions according to age, class, culture, ethnicity, faith/spirituality, gender, physical/psychological ability, sexual orientation, and more. Offered in this book is an investigation into why a homophily framework, or a similarity-attraction hypothesis, continues to perpetuate leadership by predominantly Caucasian/White males and reinforces barriers that keep qualified people possessing a multiplicity of social identity dimensions from achieving their full human potential.To understand interactive processes through which discrimination is reproduced in the workplace, social identity theorists explore connections between ways that people create social identity and that organizations become socially constructed. Social identity theory explains how people seek to develop oneness with groups that help them to develop and/or to enhance positive self-esteem - and to better understand how people develop notions of high-status ingroups and low-status outgroups. Both of these frameworks are central to this book's attention to difference in organizations. Difference is positioned as a positive advance in organizational dynamics; advocating respect and appreciation for multiple and intersecting social identities - not for profitability and other business case reasons - but because it is morally justified to eradicate inequitable and exclusionary practices in organizations. This book offers an introduction to doing difference research by introducing a number of theoretical underpinnings, addressing methodological challenges, and presenting a wide cross-section of numerous bodies of literature which have been attending to difference work. Chapter 1 is divided into subthemes of: applying social identity theory, emphasizing the ""center"" and the ""margin,"" managing organizational climate, and avoiding business case thinking and other flawed models by advocating for real diversity.",
DOING ETHNICITY IN ORGANIZATIONS,PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUCCESSFULLY DOING DIFFERENCE IN ORGANIZATIONS,2014,2014,"This chapter uses critical race theory (CRT) and postcolonial lenses to critique the postrace concept and organizational power differentials mirroring an ethnically coded society. CRT reminds us that despite anti-discrimination laws around the globe, employers still normatively pursue workplace homogeneity; not necessarily a racist impulse, but in an effort to promote perceived organizational efficiency. Understanding how organizations have become hard-wired to perpetuate White privilege helps to dismantle systemic barriers which continue to stand between people of color and an ability to reach their full human potential at work.Understanding of power and difference in organizations requires consistent diligence. Using ethnic diversity primarily as a means for advancing profit generation motives rather than as an opportunity to advance social justice, too many multinational corporations offer mere lip service to ethnic diversity. For example, organizations tend to imagine that they are more ethnically diverse than they really are and enable prejudice, racism and microagressions against people who constitute ethnic minorities. Among social researchers, attention to ethnic difference requires careful and consistent attention as well. Because skin color ranks among the most visible of social identity dimensions, diversity and ethnicity/race erroneously are considered synonymous and skin color becomes some default condition for diversity in social research studies. Chapter 5 explores these important subthemes: interrogating Whiteness and navigating diversity at work; exposing the ""requisite variety"" concept for its homophily thesis roots; examining effects of ""othering,"" liminal spaces and tokenism; racism and microaggressions have gone underground; and intersectionality of ethnicity with other social identity dimensions.",
From Offline to Online: Connecting People with a Mobile Social Networking Application at a Conference,PROCEEDINGS OF CHINESE CHI 2014: SECOND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF CHINESE CHI (CHINESE CHI 2014),2014,2014,"People that we encounter and connect with at conferences, provide opportunities for extending our social networks from offline to online. How can users easily find and connect with the relevant people in the conference? We present Find & Connect, an application that combines proximity and homophily information. We conducted a user study and deployment of our application at the UbiComp 2011 conference, and discovered that most users found it useful for finding nearby people and making new connections. Studying the offline and online user behavior reveal that certain sessions are more conducive to greater offline and online interactions, and that users add contacts primarily due to proximity (i.e. they know each other in real life and have encountered before). These results can form the stepping stone to creating a user behavior model for offline and online.",
Exploiting Homophily-based Implicit Social Network to Improve Recommendation Performance,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN),2014,2014,"Social information between users has been widely used to improve the traditional Recommender System in many previous works. However, in many websites such as Amazon and eBay, there is no explicit social graph that can be used to improve the recommendation performance. Hence in this work, in order to make it possible to employ social recommendation methods in those non-social information websites, we propose a general framework to construct a homophily-based implicit social network by utilizing both the rating and comments of items given by the users. Our scalable framework can be easily extended to enhance the performance of any recommender systems without social network by replacing the homophily-based implicit social relation definition. We propose four methods to extract and analyze the implicit social links between users, and then conduct the experiments on Amazon dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed methods work better than traditional recommendation methods without social information.",
On the relationships between social structures and acquired knowledge in societies,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN),2014,2014,"Many existing studies on human learning pay almost exclusive attention to how individuals learn. Unlike those studies, we examined influence of social structures on knowledge acquired by societies using computer simulations. We compared four types of social networks, namely regular, random, small world, and scale-free networks. When individual differences and the principle of homophily (i.e., people who have similar beliefs tend to have close relationships with each other) exist in societies, the societies would acquire pareto-optimal knowledge. We also investigated influences of highly connected individuals on knowledge acquired by societies. The results inarguably indicate that highly connected individuals play important roles in social learning, setting the standards for what type of knowledge to be acquired by societies.

Classification in Social Networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS: ANALYSIS AND CASE STUDIES,2014,2014,"Production of social network data in different kinds and huge amounts brings with it classification problems which need to be solved. In this chapter, we introduce a framework for classification in a social network. Aggregation of neighbor labels and sampling are two important aspects of classification in a social network. We give details of different aggregation methods and sampling methods. Then, we discuss different graph properties, especially homophily, which may be helpful in determining which type of classification algorithm should be used. We give details of a collective classification algorithm, ICA (Iterative Classification Algorithm), which can be used for semi-supervised learning in general and transductive learning in particular on a social network. We present classification results on three different datasets, using different aggregation and sampling methods and classifiers.",
Enhancing Web Activities with Information Visualization,WWW'14 COMPANION: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB,2014,2014,"Many activities people perform on the Web are biased, including activities like reading news, searching for information and connecting with people. Sometimes these biases are inherent in social behavior (like homophily), and sometimes they are external as they affect the system (like media bias). In this thesis proposal, we describe our approach to use information visualization to enhance Web activities performed by regular people (i.e., non-experts) We understand enhancing as reducing bias effects and generating an engaging response from users. Our methodology is based on case studies. We select a Web activity, identify the biases that affect it, and evaluate how the biases affect a population from online social networks using web mining techniques, and then, we design a visualization following an interactive and playful design approach to diminish the previously identified biases. We propose to evaluate the effect of our visualization designs in user studies by comparing them with state-of-the-art techniques considering a playful experiences framework.",
Computational Models for Social Influence Analysis,WWW'14 COMPANION: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB,2014,2014,"Social influence occurs when one's opinions, emotions, or behaviors are affected by others, intentionally or unintentionally. In this article, we survey recent research progress on social influence analysis. In particular, we first give a brief overview of related background knowledge, and then discuss what is social influence. We try to answer this question in terms of homophily and the process of influence and selection. After that, we focus on describing computational models for social influence including models for influence probability learning and influence diffusion. Finally, we discuss potential applications of social influence.Preliminaries First we introduce some basic knowledge for social network analysis, including related theories in sociology, fundamental models underlying social networks, and algorithms or measures for quantifying social influence. For social theories, we introduce social balance theory [10], social status theory [21], structural hole theory [6, 22], and two-step information flow theory [19]. For social network models, we introduce the Erdos-Renyi (ER) model 1111, Small-World model [28], and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model [4]. For algorithms, we review several fundamental problems in graph theory and the corresponding algorithms to solve them including the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow in a flow network [12], the push-relabel maximum flow algorithm for finding k-densest subgraph [13], and the greedy algorithm for the set covering problem [1]. We will also go through standard measures and concepts of social networks and their connection to social influence such as centrality, clustering coefficient, closeness and betweenness. These measures are fundamental concepts about social network analysis, and are also deeply related to the importance or influence of nodes or edges in the networks.Definition and Existential Test As there is no a formal definition for social influence, we discuss its definition in terms of several related concepts such as homophily [20], conformity [8, 27], and selection. We further describe methodologies for verifying the existence of influence in various social networks. The methods include shuffle test [2] and randomization test [24]. We will give real world examples to demonstrate how the social influence behaves in different social networks. For example, Bond et al. [5] conducted a randomized controlled trial by delivering political mobilization messages to 61 million Facebook users. Their results verified the existence of social influence on political voting behavior - when one is aware that their friends have made the political votes, their likelihood to vote will significantly increase. Bakshy et al. [3] also conducted randomized controlled trials to verify the existence of social influence on customer responses to advertising in Facebook.Computational Models We now focus on describing the computational models for social influence analysis, with an emphasis on influence quantification and influence diffusion. In particular, for influence quantification, we introduce several popular methods for learning the influence probability between users. For example, Tang et al. [26] presented a Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) approach to quantify the topic-level social influence in large networks. Goyal et al. [14] presented a method to learn the influence probabilities by counting the number of correlated social actions. Tan et a. [25] proposed a model to learn and distinguish the effects of influence, correlation, and uses' action dependency. Kutzkov et al. [18] extended influence probability learning to the stream data. They showed that the influence probabilities could be learned with one pass over the streaming data using only O(n log n) space, where n is the number of nodes in a network.For influence diffusion, we start with several state-of-the-art epidemic models such as Susceptible Infectious-Recovered (SIR) [17], Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS), and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS). Then, we focus on the two popular influence maximization model including independent cascaded model and linear threshold model. The problem of influence maximization has been formally defined as an algorithmic problem by Domingos and Richardson [9, 23]. Kempe et al. [16] further presented the independent cascaded model and the linear threshold model, and theoretically proved the NP-hardness of the two models. They defined the problem using submodular functions, with which a natural greedy strategy could obtain a solution that is provably within (1 -1/e) of optimal solution. Chen et al. [7] further developed efficient algorithms to approximately solve the influence maximization problem. Finally we will also discuss several extensions of the basic cascaded and linear threshold models, e.g., [15, 30, 29].Applications Finally we use several real applications as examples to further demonstrate the usefulness of social influence analysis. We empirically study social influence in more than 10 datasets including Twitter, Weibo, Flickr, Gowalla, Coauthor, Mobile, Slash-dot, Enron, Epinions, etc. We will share our experience and interesting findings when studying social influence on these data.",
People of Opposing Views can Share Common Interests,WWW'14 COMPANION: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB,2014,2014,"In online social networks, people tend to connect with like-minded people and read agreeable information. Direct recommendation of challenging content has not worked well because users do not value diversity and avoid challenging content. In this poster, we investigate the possibility of an indirect approach by introducing intermediary topics, which are topics that are common to people having opposing views on sensitive issues, i.e., those issues that tend to divide people. Through a case study about a sensitive issue discussed in Twitter, we show that such intermediary topics exist, opening a path for future work in recommendation promoting diversity of content to be shared.",
Understanding Spatial Homophily: The Case of Peer Influence and Social Selection,WWW'14: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WORLD WIDE WEB,2014,2014,"Homophily is a phenomenon observed very frequently in social networks and is related with the inclination of people to be involved with others that exhibit similar characteristics. The roots of homophily can be subtle and are mainly traced back to two mechanisms: (i) social selection and (ii) peer influence. Decomposing the effects of each of these mechanisms requires analysis of longitudinal data. This has been a burden to similar studies in traditional social sciences due to the hardness of collecting such information. However, the proliferation of online social media has enabled the collection of massive amounts of information related with human activities. In this work, we are interested in examining the forces of the above mechanisms in the context of the locations visited by people. For our study, we use a longitudinal dataset collected from Gowalla, a location-based social network (LBSN). LBSNs, unlike other online social media, bond users' online interactions with their activities in real-world, physical locations. Prior work on LBSNs has focused on the influence of geographical constraints on the formation of social ties. On the contrary, in this paper, we perform a microscopic study of the peer influence and social selection mechanisms in LBSNs. Our analysis indicates that while the similarity of friends' spatial trails at a geographically global scale cannot be attributed to peer influence, the latter can explain up to 40% of the geographically localized similarity between friends. Moreover, this percentage depends on the type of locations we examine, and it can be even higher for specific categories (e.g., nightlife spots). Finally, we find that the social selection mechanism, is only triggered by places that exhibit specific network characteristics. We believe that our work can have significant implications on obtaining a deeper understanding of the way that people create friendships, act and move in real space, which can further facilitate and enhance applications such as recommender systems, trip planning and marketing.",
Gender and Supportive Co-Worker Relations in the Medical Profession,GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION,Jan 2014,2014,"Women's growing numerical representation in the professions has not necessarily translated into women being truly integrated in these occupations. Questionnaire data are used to examine whether female physicians are socially integrated in the male-dominated profession of medicine in terms of the support they receive from their medical colleagues compared to male physicians. The literature on tokenism and homophily suggests that women in male-dominated professions receive less support than their male colleagues, whereas the social support literature predicts that women typically receive more emotional support than men but less informational and instrumental support. The results of this study shed light on the complex and multi-layered ways in which gender is relevant to our understanding of the extent to which co-workers provide empathy, information and assistance to one another.",

Identifying Implicit and Explicit Relationships Through User Activities in Social Media,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE,WIN 2013,2013,"Social commerce has emerged as a new paradigm of commerce due to the advancement and application of Web 2.0 technologies including social media sites. Social media sites provide a valuable opportunity for social interactions between electronic commerce consumers as well as between consumers and businesses. Although the number of users and interactions is large in social media, the social networks extracted from explicit user interactions are usually sparse. Hence, the result obtained through the analysis of the extracted network is not always useful because many potential ties in the social network are not captured by the explicit interactions between users. In this work, we propose a temporal analysis technique to identify implicit relationships that supplement the explicit relationships identified through the social media interaction functions. Our method is based on the homophily theory developed by McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook [31]. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the identified implicit relationships and the integration of implicit and explicit relationships. The results indicate that our proposed techniques are effective and achieve a higher accuracy. Our results prove the importance of implicit relationships in deriving complete online social networks that are the foundation for understanding online user communities and social network analysis. Our techniques can be applied to improve effectiveness of product and friend recommendation in social commerce.",
Social Network Characteristics and Daily Smoking among Young Adults in Sweden,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Dec 2013,2013,"A large number of studies have shown that friends' smoking behavior is strongly associated with an individual's own risk for smoking. However, few studies have examined whether other features of social networks, independently or conjointly with friends' smoking behavior, may influence the risk for smoking. Because it is characterized by the growing importance of friendship networks, the transition from adolescence to young adulthood may constitute a particularly relevant period on which to focus our investigation of network influences on smoking behavior. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequences of peer smoking as well as other network characteristics (friends' other health behaviors, relationship content, and structural aspects of the network) on the risk for smoking among young adults. The data was based on a cross-sectional survey of Swedish 19-year-olds carried out in 2009 (n = 5,695) with a response rate of 51.6%. Logistic regression was the primary method of analysis. The results show that having a large percentage of smokers in one's network was by far the most important risk factor for daily smoking. The risk of daily smoking was 21.20 (CI 14.24. 31.54) if 76%-100% of the network members smoked. Having a high percentage of physically active friends was inversely associated with daily smoking. The risk of smoking was 0.65 (CI 0.42. 1.00) if 76%-100% of the network members were physically active. No main associations between the other network characteristics (relationship content and structural aspects of the network) and smoking were found. However, there was an interaction between the percentage of smokers in the network and relationship content (i.e., trust, relationship quality and propensity to discuss problems): positive relationship content in combination with peer smoking may increase the risk of smoking. Women with a high percentage of smokers in their networks were also at higher risk of daily smoking than were men with many smoking friends. Hence, it is important to consider the interplay between peer smoking and other network characteristics on the risk of smoking, where features of networks which traditionally are seen as constructive may occasionally provide the impetus to smoke. Future studies should use longitudinal data to study whether these findings reflect peer selection or peer influence.",
Network Analysis of Free Trade Agreements: Homophily and Transitivity,The Korean Journal of International Studies,2013,2013,"Accompanying the unprecedented outburst of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), scholarly interests in the new wave of regionalism have been flourishing. Yet, notwithstanding its contribution, extant literature has paid little attention to an important aspect of FTA formation: the choice of FTA partners and the underlying structure of the FTA network. While theoretical conjectures about likely FTA partners are abundant, systematic empirical analysis is scant. We attempt to fill this gap by utilizing the concept of “transitivity” and “homophily” in social network analysis. The notion of transitivity refers that “a friend of a friend is a friend” among triads of actors, while homophily is the tendency to form social ties to the similarity in actors’ attributes. Of the various nodal attributes, three are singled out as the most important: political institutions, regionalism, and economic attributes. Using the Exponential Family Random Graph (ERG) model, we show that economic attributes produce mixed results in predicting FTA partners, whereas homophily in region explains FTA tie formation. In line with previous works, we also find strong association between democracy and FTA formation. Our empirical models suggest transitivity in FTA networks referring that an FTA partner of an FTA partner is likely to be an FTA partner.",
Cloud-Based Multicasting with Feedback in Mobile Social Networks,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS,Dec 2013,2013,"With the rapid growth of smartphone usage, mobile social networks (MSNs) are becoming increasingly popular. MSN can be considered as a type of delay tolerant network (DTN) which lacks continuous end-to-end connections between nodes, due to the node mobility and limited transmission range. Inspired by the homophily of social networks that friends are usually similar in characteristics, we present a novel concept - cloud, where the nodes in frequent contact with the destinations will form destination clouds. Neighbors in the destination cloud have a special status that can forward the message to the destination directly. We propose a cloud-based multicast scheme with feedback in MSNs with two phases: pre-cloud and inside-cloud. In the pre-cloud process, the message holder will forward the copy of the multicast message to the encountered node, based on a given forwarding metric. The forwarding metric can be iteratively refined from a feedback control mechanism. In the inside-cloud process, the message holder will wait until it meets with the destinations. We analytically formulate the multicast problem into a continuous Markov chain problem, and formally analyze the latency in this model. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that our scheme significantly improves the performance compared to existing schemes.",
FIXATION IN THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL AXELROD MODEL,ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY,Dec 2013,2013,"The Axelrod model is a spatial stochastic model for the dynamics of cultures which includes two important social factors: social influence, the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they interact, and homophily, the tendency of individuals to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar. Each vertex of the interaction network is characterized by its culture, a vector of F cultural features that can each assumes q different states. Pairs of neighbors interact at a rate proportional to the number of cultural features they have in common, which results in the interacting pair having one more cultural feature in common. In this article, we continue the analysis of the Axelrod model initiated by the first author by proving that the one-dimensional system fixates when F <= cq where the slope satisfies the equation e(-c) = c. In addition, we show that the two-feature model with at least three states fixates. This last result is sharp since it is known from previous works that the one-dimensional two-feature two-state Axelrod model clusters.",
Structures of unequal success. The social contexts of emerging winner-take-all-concentrations on flexible labor markets,KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE,Dec 2013,2013,"How does success accumulate? While the winner-take-all phenomenon has been viewed as a process of accumulating demand that results from a huge number of consumers making the same purchase decision, the conditions and interactions on the supply side have received scant attention in the literature. This paper investigates six ways sociology could contribute toward shedding light on the winner-take-all phenomenon, all of which seek to explain unequal success by examining the social structures of the labor market in which the actors are embedded. The author takes a preliminary, exploratory look from a sociological perspective at an aspect of inequality that is socially significant, yet poorly understood. The approaches presented open the way for future empirical study.",
The dynamics of health behavior sentiments on a large online social network,EPJ DATA SCIENCE,Dec 2013,2013,"Modifiable health behaviors, a leading cause of illness and death in many countries, are often driven by individual beliefs and sentiments about health and disease. Individual behaviors affecting health outcomes are increasingly modulated by social networks, for example through the associations of like-minded individuals homophily - or through peer influence effects. Using a statistical approach to measure the individual temporal effects of a large number of variables pertaining to social network statistics, we investigate the spread of a health sentiment towards a new vaccine on Twitter, a large online social network. We find that the effects of neighborhood size and exposure intensity are qualitatively very different depending on the type of sentiment. Generally, we find that larger numbers of opinionated neighbors inhibit the expression of sentiments. We also find that exposure to negative sentiment is contagious - by which we merely mean predictive of future negative sentiment expression - while exposure to positive sentiments is generally not. In fact, exposure to positive sentiments can even predict increased negative sentiment expression. Our results suggest that the effects of peer influence and social contagion on the dynamics of behavioral spread on social networks are strongly content-dependent.",
Customer Preferences for Frontline Employee Traits: Homophily and Heterophily Effects,PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING,Dec 2013,2013,"Although previous research has underscored the significance of the personality traits of frontline employees (FLEs) in employee service behaviors, knowledge about customer preferences for FLE personality traits is lacking. This study responds to this gap in the literature, empirically assessing customers' preferences for FLE personality traits. The main research objective is to investigate whether and how these preferences vary with the customer's own personality. The study proposes and tests a conceptual framework that reconciles two opposing theoretical perspectiveshomophily and heterophily. The existing research in interpersonal psychology has only given limited support to the heterophily effect, whereas it has consistently evidenced the homophily effect. Moderator analyses indicate these effects are largely invariant across customer and service characteristics. Notwithstanding this, post hoc tests show that the level of preferred FLE traits is positively related to the level of customer traits. Equity theory helps explain these seemingly conflicting results.",
Differentiation without Distancing. Explaining Bi-Polarization of Opinions without Negative Influence,PLOS ONE,Nov 27 2013,2013,"Explanations of opinion bi-polarization hinge on the assumption of negative influence, individuals' striving to amplify differences to disliked others. However, empirical evidence for negative influence is inconclusive, which motivated us to search for an alternative explanation. Here, we demonstrate that bi-polarization can be explained without negative influence, drawing on theories that emphasize the communication of arguments as central mechanism of influence. Due to homophily, actors interact mainly with others whose arguments will intensify existing tendencies for or against the issue at stake. We develop an agent-based model of this theory and compare its implications to those of existing social-influence models, deriving testable hypotheses about the conditions of bi-polarization. Hypotheses were tested with a group-discussion experiment (N = 96). Results demonstrate that argument exchange can entail bi-polarization even when there is no negative influence.",
Similarity increases altruistic punishment in humans,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Nov 26 2013,2013,"Humans are attracted to similar others. As a consequence, social networks are homogeneous in sociodemographic, intrapersonal, and other characteristics-a principle called homophily. Despite abundant evidence showing the importance of interpersonal similarity and homophily for human relationships, their behavioral correlates and cognitive foundations are poorly understood. Here, we show that perceived similarity substantially increases altruistic punishment, a key mechanism underlying human cooperation. We induced (dis)similarity perception by manipulating basic cognitive mechanisms in an economic cooperation game that included a punishment phase. We found that similarity-focused participants were more willing to punish others' uncooperative behavior. This influence of similarity is not explained by group identity, which has the opposite effect on altruistic punishment. Our findings demonstrate that pure similarity promotes reciprocity in ways known to encourage cooperation. At the same time, the increased willingness to punish norm violations among similarity-focused participants provides a rationale for why similar people are more likely to build stable social relationships. Finally, our findings show that altruistic punishment is differentially involved in encouraging cooperation under pure similarity vs. in-group conditions.",
"Feasibility of Recruiting a Diverse Sample of Men Who Have Sex with Men: Observation from Nanjing, China",PLOS ONE,Nov 14 2013,2013,"Background: Respondent-driven-sampling (RDS) has well been recognized as a method for sampling from most hard-to-reach populations like commercial sex workers, drug users and men who have sex with men. However the feasibility of this sampling strategy in terms of recruiting a diverse spectrum of these hidden populations has not been understood well yet in developing countries.Methods: In a cross sectional study in Nanjing city of Jiangsu province of China, 430 MSM were recruited including 9 seeds in 14 weeks of study period using RDS. Information regarding socio-demographic characteristics and sexual risk behavior were collected and testing was done for HIV and syphilis. Duration, completion, participant characteristics and the equilibrium of key factors were used for assessing feasibility of RDS. Homophily of key variables, socio-demographic distribution and social network size were used as the indicators of diversity.Results: In the study sample, adjusted HIV and syphilis prevalence were 6.6% and 14.6% respectively. Majority (96.3%) of the participants were recruited by members of their own social network. Although there was a tendency for recruitment within the same self-identified group (homosexuals recruited 60.0% homosexuals), considerable cross-group recruitment (bisexuals recruited 52.3% homosexuals) was also seen. Homophily of the self-identified sexual orientations was 0.111 for homosexuals. Upon completion of the recruitment process, participant characteristics and the equilibrium of key factors indicated that RDS was feasible for sampling MSM in Nanjing. Participants recruited by RDS were found to be diverse after assessing the homophily of key variables in successive waves of recruitment, the proportion of characteristics after reaching equilibrium and the social network size. The observed design effects were nearly the same or even better than the theoretical design effect of 2.Conclusion: RDS was found to be an efficient and feasible sampling method for recruiting a diverse sample of MSM in a reasonable time.",
"Temporal motifs reveal homophily, gender-specific patterns, and group talk in call sequences",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Nov 5 2013,2013,"Recent studies on electronic communication records have shown that human communication has complex temporal structure. We study how communication patterns that involve multiple individuals are affected by attributes such as sex and age. To this end, we represent the communication records as a colored temporal network where node color is used to represent individuals' attributes, and identify patterns known as temporal motifs. We then construct a null model for the occurrence of temporal motifs that takes into account the interaction frequencies and connectivity between nodes of different colors. This null model allows us to detect significant patterns in call sequences that cannot be observed in a static network that uses interaction frequencies as link weights. We find sex-related differences in communication patterns in a large dataset of mobile phone records and show the existence of temporal homophily, the tendency of similar individuals to participate in communication patterns beyond what would be expected on the basis of their average interaction frequencies. We also show that temporal patterns differ between dense and sparse neighborhoods in the network. Because also this result is independent of interaction frequencies, it can be seen as an extension of Granovetter's hypothesis to temporal networks.",
Modeling Choice Interdependence in a Social Network,MARKETING SCIENCE,NOV-DEC 2013,2013,"This paper investigates how individuals' product choices are influenced by the product choices of their connected others and how the influence mechanism may differ for fashion- versus technology-related products. We conduct a novel field experiment to induce and observe choice interdependence in a closed social network. In our experiment, we conceptualize individuals' choices to be driven by multiattribute utilities, and we measure their initial attribute preferences prior to observing their choice interdependence and collecting network information. These design elements help alleviate concerns in identifying social interaction effects from other confounds. Given that we have complete information on choices and their sequence, we use a discrete-time Markov chain model. Nonetheless, we also use a Markov random field (MRF) model as an alternative when the information on choice sequence is missing. We find significant social interaction effects. Our findings show that whereas experts exert asymmetrically greater influence on a technology-related product, popular individuals exert greater influence on a fashion-related product. In addition, we find choices made by early decision makers to be more influential than choices made later for the technology-related product. Finally, using the MRF with snapshot data can also provide good out-of-sample predictions for a technology-related product.",
"He Said, She Said: Sex, Social Networks, and Voting Behavior",AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH,Nov 2013,2013,"This paper examines how interpersonal social networks relate to the voting behavior of men and women. We argue that underlying the gender gap in voting is related to social processes that depend on the partisan and sex composition of networks. Analysis of the 2000 American National Election Study identified two ways that sex differences are relevant to network explanations of voting behavior. First, men have more sex homophily in their networks than women. As men are more likely to be Republican than women, this leads to different discussion environments for men and women. Second, menand not womenare more likely to share the political opinion of women discussants, but only when they are pro-Bush and the remainder of the network is also supportive. The results support a social model of voting behavior that highlights the importance of social factors (in this case sex) other than just partisan differences.",
Distance matters: Exploring proximity and homophily in virtual world networks,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Nov 2013,2013,"Distance has long been a powerful force that influences the ways in which we organize our personal relationships and collaborations. In the past two decades, globalization and the advent of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have brought profound changes to the formation and maintenance of communication networks in contemporary work and social settings by eliminating the constraints of physical distance on human interaction. To study the role of distance in ICT-enabled virtual worlds, we propose three dimensions of proximity-space, time, and homophily-and analyze the impact of distance, time zones, gender, age, and game age on building collaborative relations in online games. The results show that spatial proximity, temporal proximity, and homophily in age and game age still have a strong impact on players' behavior in creating online relations in virtual worlds, however, there is no evidence of gender homophily. This study suggests that offline proximity plays an important role in bringing people together in virtual worlds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
"Status Homophily, Sexual Identity, and Lesbian Social Ties",JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY,Oct 1 2013,2013,"The literature on friendship and social networks finds that individuals form social ties with people who are like thema much studied concept called homophily. However, few studies have explicitly examined sexual identity as a point of homophily. Scholars from multiple disciplines have long argued that sexuality influences the organization of our social worlds, yet most studies of friendship and social networks under-examine or overlook the influence of sexual identity. This study addresses that gap by looking at status homophily among lesbian social ties to examine the influence of sexual identity, as well as gender, race, class, and family, on their personal networks. Using survey data from 544 U.S. lesbian respondents, the findings make visible some of the factors and forces that shape social ties for lesbians. The results point to the importance of sexuality as an organizing element of social life, and suggest that studies that examine social networks or friendships more often make sexual identity, gender, and intersecting social locations a central focus.",
Lean on me: an exploratory study of the spousal support received by physicians,PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH & MEDICINE,Oct 1 2013,2013,"This paper uses interview data from physicians and their spouses to describe the types of spousal support physicians receive when coping with work-related stress and to explore whether they vary by occupational similarity, gender, and parental status. The physicians described receiving different types of spousal support: emotional, informational, and instrumental. Male physicians in this study often reported receiving emotional support from their spouse, consistent with the support gap hypothesis in the literature. An unexpected finding is that from the responses of the physicians' spouses, the husbands often reported offering emotional support to their physician spouse. Physicians who shared similar occupational and work experiences with their spouse (i.e. married to another physician) reported receiving informational support from their spouse, consistent with the theory of homophily. Finally, the findings also suggested that once physicians have children, their wives often reported providing instrumental support by being primarily responsible for childcare and housework. An interesting finding of this study is the discrepancy between the physicians and their spouses in their perceptions of support.",
Adolescent Peer Choice and Cigarette Smoking: Evidence of Active Gene-Environment Correlation?,TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS,Oct 2013,2013,"Both peer groups and genetics have been associated with adolescent smoking behavior. Recently, Loehlin (Loehlin, J. C. (2010). Is there an active gene-environment correlation in adolescent drinking behavior? Behavior Genetics, 40, 447-451) reported that twin differences in alcohol use were associated with differences in the number of common friends. Twins with more common friends were more similar in drinking, but only for dizygotic pairs. Using the same sample as Loehlin's (the National Merit twins), we replicated all of these findings for a composite cigarette smoking measure and for smoking initiation, but not persistence. The pattern of results is most consistent with homophily, or the tendency to associate with individuals that are like oneself. If peer influence occurs in the presence of homophily, then active genotype-environment correlation will be induced.",
"Bayesian analysis for partially observed network data, missing ties, attributes and actors",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2013,2013,"We consider partially observed network data as defined in Handcock and Gile (2010). More specifically we introduce an elaboration of the Bayesian data augmentation scheme of Koskinen et al. (2010) that uses the exchange algorithm (Caimo and Friel, 2011) for inference for the exponential random graph model (ERGM) where tie variables are partly observed. We illustrate the generating of posteriors and unobserved tie-variables with empirical network data where 74% of the tie variables are unobserved under the assumption that some standard assumptions hold true. One of these assumptions is that covariates are fixed and completely observed. A likely scenario is that also covariates might only be partially observed and we propose a further extension of the data augmentation algorithm for missing attributes. We provide an illustrative example of parameter inference with nearly 30% of dyads affected by missing attributes (e.g. homophily effects). The assumption that all actors are known is another assumption that is liable to be violated so that there are ""covert actors"". We briefly discuss various aspects of this problem with reference to the Sageman (2004) data set on suspected terrorists. We conclude by identifying some areas in need of further research.

Gender homophily from spatial behavior in a primary school: A sociometric study,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2013,2013,"We investigate gender homophily in the spatial proximity of children (6-12 years old) in a French primary school, using time-resolved data on face-to-face proximity recorded by means of wearable sensors. For strong ties, i.e., for pairs of children who interact more than a defined threshold, we find statistical evidence of gender preference that increases with grade. For weak ties, conversely, gender homophily is negatively correlated with grade for girls, and positively correlated with grade for boys. This different evolution with grade of weak and strong ties exposes a contrasted picture of gender homophily. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Extrapolative simulation of neighborhood networks based on population spatial distribution: Do they predict crime?,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2013,2013,"Objectives: Previous criminological scholarship has posited that network ties among neighborhood residents may impact crime rates, but has done little to consider the specific ways in which network structure may enhance or inhibit criminal activity. A lack of data on social ties has arguably led to this state of affairs. We propose to avoid this limitation by demonstrating a novel approach of extrapolatively simulating network ties and constructing structural network measures to assess their effect on neighborhood crime rates.Methods: We first spatially locate the households of a city into their constituent blocks. Then, we employ spatial interaction functions based on prior empirical work and simulate a network of social ties among these residents. From this simulated network, we compute network statistics that more appropriately capture the notions of cohesion and information diffusion that underlie theories of networks and crime.Results: We show that these network statistics are robust predictors of the levels of crime in five separate cities (above standard controls) at the very micro geographic level of blocks and block groups.Conclusions: We conclude by considering extensions of the approach that account for homophily in the formation of network ties.

Structural effects of network sampling coverage I: Nodes missing at random,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2013,2013,"Network measures assume a census of a well-bounded population. This level of coverage is rarely achieved in practice, however, and we have only limited information on the robustness of network measures to incomplete coverage. This paper examines the effect of node-level missingness on 4 classes of network measures: centrality, centralization, topology and homophily across a diverse sample of 12 empirical networks. We use a Monte Carlo simulation process to generate data with known levels of missingness and compare the resulting network scores to their known starting values. As with past studies (Borgatti et al., 2006; Kossinets, 2006), we find that measurement bias generally increases with more missing data. The exact rate and nature of this increase, however, varies systematically across network measures. For example, betweenness and Bonacich centralization are quite sensitive to missing data while closeness and in-degree are robust. Similarly, while the tau statistic and distance are difficult to capture with missing data, transitivity shows little bias even with very high levels of missingness. The results are also clearly dependent on the features of the network. Larger, more centralized networks are generally more robust to missing data, but this is especially true for centrality and centralization measures. More cohesive networks are robust to missing data when measuring topological features but not when measuring centralization. Overall, the results suggest that missing data may have quite large or quite small effects on network measurement, depending on the type of network and the question being posed.

Birds of a Different Feather: How Do Cross-Ethnic Friends Flock Together?,MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY-JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Oct 2013,2013,"This study examined how homophily (similarity) and propinquity (availability) simultaneously predict both unidirectional and reciprocal cross-ethnic friendships among early adolescents in ethnically diverse classrooms. In a sample of sixth-grade students, liking nominations were used as the indicator of friendship, and both unidirectional and reciprocal cross-ethnic liking nominations were strongly influenced by propinquity, particularly within friendship networks. Homophily appeared to have a greater influence on reciprocal cross-ethnic liking. Similar to previous research, high status (""cool"") early adolescents were more likely to make unidirectional cross-ethnic liking nominations with lower-status peers. However, this effect diminished as classroom ethnic diversity increased, suggesting a unique relationship between classroom ethnic composition, peer status, and intergroup liking. The findings suggest that similarity, the availability of cross-ethnic peers in social networks, and peer status are salient predictors of cross-ethnic friendships, although the influence of each varies depending on whether the friendship is unidirectional or reciprocal. Implications for research on cross-ethnic friendships were discussed.",
The Role of Conversation in Developing Accurate Political Perceptions: A Multilevel Social Network Approach,HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,Oct 2013,2013,"We employed social network data from 25 randomly sampled voluntary associations to understand the factors associated with accurate perceptions of candidate preferences of group members. We analyzed relationships at the dyadic level, but also considered the overall accuracy of perceptions by each ego of all alters (perceptiveness) and the overall accuracy of perception by all alters of each ego (explicitness) regarding candidate preferences using multilevel modeling techniques. We found low levels of accuracy on average, but high variability and differential patterns of prediction of perceptiveness and explicitness. There was a strong, consistent link between the frequency of communication and accuracy both at the dyadic and aggregate levels which was moderated by the homophily of political preferences within the group.",
SHOOT FOR THE STARS? PREDICTING THE RECRUITMENT OF PRESTIGIOUS DIRECTORS AT NEWLY PUBLIC FIRMS,ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Oct 2013,2013,"This study explores how CEOs' and outside directors' desires for the benefits of signaling and ""homophily"" intertwine with their concerns over maintaining power and preserving local status hierarchies to affect the likelihood a firm recruits prestigious outside directors to its board. Using pooled cross-sectional data on the five years following the initial public offerings (IPOs) of 210 firms that went public between 2001 and 2004, we found that prestigious CEOs and directors viewed the recruitment of prestigious new directors differently and that these perceptions were moderated by factors that increase the salience of risk of potential losses to CEOs and existing board members.",
Contributions of Racial and Sociobehavioral Homophily to Friendship Stability and Quality Among Same-Race and Cross-Race Friends,JOURNAL OF EARLY ADOLESCENCE,Oct 2013,2013,"The current study examined how racial and sociobehavioral similarities were associated with friendship stability and friendship quality. Cross-race friends were not significantly similar to each other in peer-nominated shyness/withdrawal, victimization, exclusion, and popularity/sociability. Relative to same-race friends, cross-race friends were significantly less similar in peer-nominated popularity/sociability, exclusion, and victimization. Although same-race friendships were more prevalent than cross-race friendships, only similarity in friends' aggressive behavior (but not racial homophily) was related to friendship stability. Neither racial nor sociobehavioral similarity predicted friendship quality beyond adolescents' individual sociobehavioral characteristics. Taken together, findings suggest that although racial similarity may affect initial friendship formation, racial similarity may not impact friendship stability or friendship quality when also accounting for friends' similarity in sociobehavioral characteristics.",
Do Birds of a Feather Flock Together?,HUMAN NATURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE,Sep 2013,2013,"Cooperation requires that individuals are able to identify, and preferentially associate with, others who have compatible preferences and the shared background knowledge needed to solve interpersonal coordination problems. The present study investigates the nature of such similarity within social networks, asking: What do friends have in common? And what is the relationship between similarity and altruism? The results show that similarity declines with frequency of contact; similarity in general is a significant predictor of altruism and emotional closeness; and, specifically, sharing a sense of humor, hobbies and interests, moral beliefs, and being from the same area are the best predictors. These results shed light on the structure of relationships within networks and provide a possible checklist for predicting attitudes toward strangers, and in-group identification.",
The differential contributions of teen drinking homophily to new and existing friendships: An empirical assessment of assortative and proximity selection mechanisms,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Sep 2013,2013,"Alcohol use, is pervasive in adolescence. Though most research is concerned with how friends influence drinking, alcohol is also important for connecting teens to one another. Prior studies have not distinguished between new friendship creation, and existing friendship durability, however. We argue that accounting for distinctions in creation-durability processes is critical for understanding the selection mechanisms drawing drinkers into homophilous friendships, and the social integration that results. In order to address these issues, we applied stochastic actor based models of network dynamics to National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data. Adolescents only modestly prefer new friendships with others who drinker similarly, but greatly prefer friends who indirectly connect them to homophilous drinkers. These indirect homophilous drinker relationships are shorter lived, however, and suggest that drinking is a social focus that connects adolescents via proximity, rather than assortativity. These findings suggest that drinking leads to more situational and superficial social integration. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Counterbalances to Economic Homophily: Microlevel Mechanisms in a Historical Setting,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Sep 1 2013,2013,"The tendency to transact within, rather than across, identity-based groups is a well-established effect of identity divisions. While previous work emphasized macrolevel, impersonal factors that counteract this tendency, this article looks at how individuals may counteract it in everyday interaction. Two microlevel counterbalances to economic homophily are examined with unique data on partnerships among Tory and Whig merchants in 18th-century Bristol, England. No conclusive support is found for the first examined counterbalance, which presumes that cross-group social relations, such as joint civic activities, induce parallel economic relations. Instead, the analysis shows that Tory-Whig partnerships were facilitated by the practice of choosing cross-party partners of unequal professional prominence. Such professionally unequal relations involve tacit status subordination, which reduces the relation-specific uncertainty associated with transacting across a salient identity division. The results highlight the potential of uncertainty avoidance to sustain inequality between social groups and suggest unexplored contingencies to theories of status homophily.",
"Diversity, Integration, and Social Ties: Attraction versus Repulsion as Drivers of Intra-and Intergroup Relations",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Sep 1 2013,2013,"Interethnic and intergroup social ties are critical to knitting together increasingly diverse societies into cohesive wholes. Yet their formation faces the homophily hurdle: important and intimate social ties tend to be established disproportionately between those sharing significant social attributes. In the spirit of analytical sociology, the author explores two mechanisms that could drive intra- and intergroup relations: attraction to similar versus repulsion from dissimilar others. The models differ in predictions as illustrated by data on interethnic marriages in Great Britain and the United States, on U.S. dating and cohabitation relations by religion and education, on educational diversity in marriages in 22 European countries, and on marriages of the native and foreign-born in Austria. A unified model for the two mechanisms, in which tie formation is a conceptualized as a two-stage process of encounter and consummation, is proposed, and its empirical and theoretical analysis provides deeper understanding of the homophily hurdle.",
Exploring motivations for intercultural contact among host country university students: An Irish case study,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS,Sep 2013,2013,"This article is concerned primarily with university students' motivations for voluntarily seeking out intercultural contact on campus. It is based on a larger qualitative research project conducted in an Irish university. This project used a grounded theory approach to explore intercultural relations among students specifically from the perspective of the host culture student cohort. The findings indicate that host students' decision to engage in intercultural contact is based primarily on a perceived utility associated with such contact, which is based on an informal cost-benefit analysis. Other, less prevalent motivational drivers, such as concern for others and the idea of having a shared future are also identified. Although the study focuses on a higher education environment, many of the ideas and theories discussed and questions raised may be applied to broader intercultural environments. In particular the article aims to highlight the current gap in literature relating to motivations for engaging in intercultural contact and also seeks to highlight the potential value of social exchange theory (Thibaut & Kelley, 1959) to understanding the dynamics of intercultural contact. It also emphasises the relevance of the concept of `homophily' (Lazarsfeld & Merton, 1954) to the field of intercultural studies. As such, the article seeks to combine empirical data with extant theory in order to gain a deeper understanding into the dynamics of intercultural contact. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Discretion Within Constraint: Homophily and Structure in a Formal Organization,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,SEP-OCT 2013,2013,"Homophily in social relations results from both individual preferences and selective opportunities for interaction, but how these two mechanisms interact in large, contemporary organizations is not well understood. We argue that organizational structures and geography delimit opportunities for interaction such that actors have a greater level of discretion to choose their interaction partners within business units, job functions, offices, and quasi-formal structures. This leads us to expect to find a higher proportion of homophilous interactions within these organizational structures than across their boundaries. We test our theory in an analysis of the rate of dyadic communication in an email data set comprising thousands of employees in a large information technology firm. These findings have implications for research on homophily, gender relations in organizations, and formal and informal organizational structure.",
Status Locality on the Web: Implications for Building Focused Collections,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Sep 2013,2013,"Topical locality on the Web is the notion that pages tend to link to other topically similar pages and that such similarity decays rapidly with link distance. This supports meaningful Web browsing and searching by information consumers. It also allows topical Web crawlers, programs that fetch pages by following hyperlinks, to harvest topical subsets of the Web for applications such as those in vertical search and business intelligence. We show that the Web exhibits another property that we call ""status locality."" It is based on the notion that pages tend to link to other pages of similar status (importance) and that this status similarity also decays rapidly with link distance. Analogous to topical locality status locality may also be exploited by Web crawlers. Collections built by such crawlers include pages that are both topically relevant and also important. This capability is crucial because of the large numbers of Web pages addressing even niche topics. The challenge in exploiting status locality while crawling is that page importance (or status) is typically recognized through global measures computed by processing link data from billion of pages. In contrast, topical Web crawlers depend on local information based on previously downloaded pages. We solve this problem by using methods developed previously that utilize local characteristics of pages to estimate their global status. This leads to the design of new crawlers, specifically of utility-biased crawlers guided by a Cobb-Douglas utility function. Our crawler experiments show that status and topicality of Web collections present a trade-off. An adaptive version of our utility-biased crawler dynamically modifies output elasticities of topicality and status to create Web collections that maintain high average topicality. This can be done while simultaneously achieving significantly higher average status as compared to several benchmarks including a state-of-the-art topical crawler.",
Generative Models for Item Adoptions Using Social Correlation,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING,Sep 2013,2013,"Users face many choices on the web when it comes to choosing which product to buy, which video to watch, and so on. In making adoption decisions, users rely not only on their own preferences, but also on friends. We call the latter social correlation, which may be caused by the homophily and social influence effects. In this paper, we focus on modeling social correlation on users item adoptions. Given a user-user social graph and an item-user adoption graph, our research seeks to answer the following questions: Whether the items adopted by a user correlate with items adopted by her friends, and how to model item adoptions using social correlation. We propose a social correlation framework that considers a social correlation matrix representing the degrees of correlation from every user to the users friends, in addition to a set of latent factors representing topics of interests of individual users. Based on the framework, we develop two generative models, namely sequential and unified, and the corresponding parameter estimation approaches. From each model, we devise the social correlation only and hybrid methods for predicting missing adoption links. Experiments on LiveJournal and Epinions data sets show that our proposed models outperform the approach based on latent factors only (LDA).",
Virality Prediction and Community Structure in Social Networks,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Aug 28 2013,2013,"How does network structure affect diffusion? Recent studies suggest that the answer depends on the type of contagion. Complex contagions, unlike infectious diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social reinforcement and homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered communities is enhanced, while diffusion across communities is hampered. A common hypothesis is that memes and behaviors are complex contagions. We show that, while most memes indeed spread like complex contagions, a few viral memes spread across many communities, like diseases. We demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme can be predicted by quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of community concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral it is. We present a practical method to translate data about community structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread widely. This connection contributes to our understanding in computational social science, social media analytics, and marketing applications.",
"Correlates of HIV Infection Among Transfemales, San Francisco, 2010: Results From a Respondent-Driven Sampling Study",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Aug 2013,2013,"Objectives. We evaluated the use of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) among a high-risk population of transfemales. We also obtained up-to-date epidemiological data on HIV infection and related correlates among this population.Methods. We evaluated the utility of RDS in recruiting a sample of 314 transfemales in San Francisco, California, from August to December 2010 by examining patterns of recruitment and assessing network sizes and equilibrium. We used RDS weights to conduct bivariate and multivariate analyses of correlates of HIV infection.Results. The sample had moderate homophily and reached equilibrium at the eighth wave of recruitment. Weighted HIV prevalence among transfemales was 39.5%. Being a transfemale of color, using injection drugs, and having low educational attainment were independently associated with HIV infection and having a high number of sexual partners and identifying as female were not.Conclusions. RDS performed well and allowed for analyses that are generalizable to the population from which the sample was drawn. Transfemales in San Francisco are disproportionately affected by HIV compared with all other groups except men who have sex with men who also inject drugs.",
Improving customer acquisition models by incorporating spatial autocorrelation at different levels of granularity,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Aug 2013,2013,"Traditional CRM models often ignore the correlation that could exist among the purchasing behavior of surrounding prospects. Hence, a generalized linear autologistic regression model can be used to capture this interdependence and improve the predictive performance of the model. In particular, customer acquisition models can benefit from this. These models often suffer from a lack of data quality due to the limited amount of information available about potential new customers. Based on a customer acquisition model of a Japanese automobile brand, this study shows that the extra value resulting from incorporating neighborhood effects can vary significantly depending on the granularity level on which the neighborhoods are composed. A model based on a granularity level that is too coarse or too fine will incorporate too much or too little interdependence resulting in a less than optimal predictive improvement. Since neighborhood effects can have several sources (i.e. social influence, homophily and exogeneous shocks), this study suggests that the autocorrelation can be divided into several parts, each optimally measured at a different level of granularity. Therefore, a model is introduced that simultaneously incorporates multiple levels of granularity resulting in even more accurate predictions. Further, the effect of the sample size is examined. This shows that including spatial interdependence using finer levels of granularity is only useful when enough data is available to construct stable spatial lag effects. As a result, extending a spatial model with multiple granularity levels becomes increasingly valuable when the data sample becomes larger.",
Homophily in Peer Groups,AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MICROECONOMICS,Aug 2013,2013,"The focus of this paper is the endogenous formation of peer groups. In our model, agents choose peers before making contributions to public projects, and they differ in how much they value one project relative to another. Thus, the group's preference composition affects the type of contributions made. We characterize stable groups and find that they must be sufficiently homogeneous. We also provide conditions for some heterogeneity to persist as the group size grows large. In an application in which the projects entail information collection and sharing within the group, stability requires more similarity among extremists than among moderate individuals.",
Understanding recruitment: outcomes associated with alternate methods for seed selection in respondent driven sampling,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,Jul 17 2013,2013,"Background: Respondent driven sampling (RDS) was designed for sampling ""hidden"" populations and intended as a means of generating unbiased population estimates. Its widespread use has been accompanied by increasing scrutiny as researchers attempt to understand the extent to which the population estimates produced by RDS are, in fact, generalizable to the actual population of interest. In this study we compare two different methods of seed selection to determine whether this may influence recruitment and RDS measures.Methods: Two seed groups were established. One group was selected as per a standard RDS approach of study staff purposefully selecting a small number of individuals to initiate recruitment chains. The second group consisted of individuals self-presenting to study staff during the time of data collection. Recruitment was allowed to unfold from each group and RDS estimates were compared between the groups. A comparison of variables associated with HIV was also completed.Results: Three analytic groups were used for the majority of the analyses-RDS recruits originating from study staffs-elected seeds (n = 196); self-presenting seeds (n = 118); and recruits of self-presenting seeds (n = 264). Multinomial logistic regression demonstrated significant differences between the three groups across six of ten sociodemographic and risk behaviours examined. Examination of homophily values also revealed differences in recruitment from the two seed groups (e. g. in one arm of the study sex workers and solvent users tended not to recruit others like themselves, while the opposite was true in the second arm of the study). RDS estimates of population proportions were also different between the two recruitment arms; in some cases corresponding confidence intervals between the two recruitment arms did not overlap. Further differences were revealed when comparisons of HIV prevalence were carried out.Conclusions: RDS is a cost-effective tool for data collection, however, seed selection has the potential to influence which subgroups within a population are accessed. Our findings indicate that using multiple methods for seed selection may improve access to hidden populations. Our results further highlight the need for a greater understanding of RDS to ensure appropriate, accurate and representative estimates of a population can be obtained from an RDS sample.",
The Role of Social Networks in Physical and Relational Aggression Among Young Adolescents,JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE,Jul 2013,2013,"Despite the veritable influence of the peer context on the elaboration of adolescent aggression, few studies of relational aggression have directly identified and measured peer groups, limiting our ability to draw formal conclusions about the level and nature of peer influence. The current study used a developmental framework to examine peer group influence on individual levels of physical and relational aggression over a year with 6th and 7th grade students (n = 346, 51 % female). A multilevel network approach was used in which peer groups were identified via social network analysis, and peer group influence was evaluated with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). HLM analyses indicated that peer group aggression (physical and relational) at time 1 was predictive of individual aggression levels at time 2 after controlling for other peer group characteristics as well as other individual risk and protective factors. Although both forms of aggression were embedded in peer networks, findings suggest that physical aggression is relatively less endemic to peer networks, and is more likely to occur in smaller, predominantly male networks. The current study highlights the importance of understanding the influence of peer group membership on adolescent aggression and points to important implications for prevention.",
An Empirical Examination of Respondent Driven Sampling Design Effects Among HIV Risk Groups from Studies Conducted Around the World,AIDS AND BEHAVIOR,Jul 2013,2013,"For studies using respondent driven sampling (RDS), the current practice of collecting a sample twice as large as that used in simple random sampling (SRS) (i.e. design effect of 2.00) may not be sufficient. This paper provides empirical evidence of sample-to-sample variability in design effects using data from nine studies in six countries among injecting drug users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men and male-to-female transgender (MTF) persons. We computed the design effect as the variance under RDS divided by the variance under SRS for a broad range of demographic and behavioral variables in each study. We also estimated several measures for each variable in each study that we hypothesized might be related to design effect: the number of waves needed for equilibrium, homophily, and mean network size. Design effects for all studies ranged from 1.20 to 5.90. Mean design effects among all studies ranged from 1.50 to 3.70. A particularly high design effect was found for employment status (design effect of 5.90) of MTF in Peru. This may be explained by a ""bottleneck""aEuro""defined as the occurrence of a relatively small number of recruitment ties between two groups in the population. A design effect of two for RDS studies may not be sufficient. Since the mean design effect across all studies was 2.33, an effect slightly above 2.00 may be adequate; however, an effect closer to 3.00 or 4.00 might be more appropriate.",
"Mate Selection in Cyberspace: The Intersection of Race, Gender, and Education",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Jul 1 2013,2013,"In this article, the authors examine how race, gender, and education jointly shape interaction among heterosexual Internet daters. They find that racial homophily dominates mate-searching behavior for both men and women. A racial hierarchy emerges in the reciprocating process. Women respond only to men of similar or more dominant racial status, while nonblack men respond to all but black women. Significantly, the authors find that education does not mediate the observed racial preferences among white men and white women. White men and white women with a college degree are more likely to contact and to respond to white daters without a college degree than they are to black daters with a college degree.",
The influence of ethnocentrism on social perceptions of nonnative accents,LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION,Jul 2013,2013,"This study examines the relationship between ethnocentrism and perceptions of nonnative accents. Participants were assigned to either an experimental or a control group. After completing a measure of ethnocentrism, participants in both groups were exposed to one of two videos of the same speaker delivering a speech on the benefits of exercise. The videos were identical except that the speaker in the video viewed by the experimental group spoke with a nonnative accent while the speaker viewed by the control group spoke with a standard American accent. For the experimental group, ethnocentrism was negatively and significantly correlated with perceptions of the speaker's physical, social, and task attractiveness, his credibility, and perceived homophily. For the control group, none of the correlations were significant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Variations in network boundary and type: A study of adolescent peer influences,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2013,2013,"This study compares variation in network boundary and network type on network indicators such as degree and estimates of social influences on adolescent substance use. We compare associations between individual use and peer use of tobacco and alcohol when network boundary (e.g., classroom, entire grade in school, and community) and relational type (elicited by asking whom students: (a) are friends with, (b) admire, (c) think will succeed, (d) would like to have a romantic relationship with, and (e) think are popular) are varied. Additionally, we estimate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) for 232 networks to obtain a homophily estimate for smoking and drinking. Data were collected from a cross-sectional sample of 1707 adolescents in five high schools in one school district in Los Angeles, CA. Results of logistic regression models show that associations were strongest when the boundary condition was least constrained and that associations were stronger for friendship networks than for other ones. Additionally, ERGM estimations show that grade-level friendship networks returned significant homophily effects more frequently than the classroom networks. This study validates existing theoretical approaches to the network study of social influence as well as ways to estimate them. We recommend researchers use as broad a boundary as possible when collecting network data, but observe that for some research purposes more narrow boundaries may be preferred. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

An agent-based random-utility-maximization model to generate social networks with transitivity in geographic space,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2013,2013,"Stochastic actor-based approaches receive increasing interest in the generation of social networks for simulation in time and space. Existing models however cannot be readily integrated in agent-based models that assume random-utility-maximizing behavior of agents. We propose an agent-based model to generate social networks explicitly in geographic space which is formulated in the random-utility-maximizing (RUM) framework. The proposed model consists of a friendship formation mechanism and a component to simulate social encounters in a population. We show how transitivity can be incorporated in both components and how the model can be estimated based on data of personal networks using likelihood estimation. In an application to the Swiss context, we demonstrate the estimation and ability of the model to reproduce relevant characteristics of networks, such as geographic proximity, attribute similarity (homophily), size of personal networks (degree distribution) and clustering (transitivity). We conclude that the proposed social-network model fits seamlessly in existing large-scale micro-simulation systems which assume RUM behavior of agents. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
"Exploring the Characteristics of Innovation Adoption in Social Networks: Structure, Homophily, and Strategy",ENTROPY,Jul 2013,2013,"Exploration of the characteristics of innovation adoption in the context of social network will add new insights beyond the traditional innovation models. In this paper, we establish a new agent-based model to simulate the behaviors of agents in terms of innovation adoption. Specifically, we examine the effects of the network structure, homophily and strategy, among which homophily is a new topic in this field of innovation adoption. The experiments illustrate six important findings involving five aspects and their influences on the innovation adoption. The five aspects are initial conditions, homophily, network topology, rules of updating and strategy, respectively. This paper also compares the different cases within one aspect or across several aspects listed above. Accordingly, some management advices and future work are provided in the last part of this paper.",
Political Homophily and Collaboration in Regional Planning Networks,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,Jul 2013,2013,"We study the extent of political homophilythe tendency to form connections with others who are politically similarin local governments' decisions to participate in an important form of intergovernmental collaboration: regional planning networks. Using data from a recent survey of California planners and government officials, we develop and test hypotheses about the factors that lead local governments to collaborate within regional planning networks. We find that local governments whose constituents are similar politically, in terms of partisanship and voting behavior, are more likely to collaborate with one another in regional planning efforts than those whose constituents are politically diverse. We conclude that political homophily reduces the transaction costs associated with institutional collective action, even in settings where we expect political considerations to be minimal.",
Do We Believe in TripAdvisor? Examining Credibility Perceptions and Online Travelers' Attitude toward Using User-Generated Content,JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH,Jul 2013,2013,"Recent press reports and complaints by hoteliers have called into question the credibility of travel-related user-generated content (UGC). Yet our understanding of the role of credibility perceptions in the context of UGC is limited, notwithstanding the rising interest in social media. Using an online survey of 661 travel consumers, this study applies the component-based structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares to examine online travelers' perceptions of the credibility of UGC sources and how these perceptions influence attitudes and intentions toward UGC utilization in the travel planning process. The model also draws on the theory of homophily to make predictions about the antecedent of credibility. Results validate the Source Credibility Theory in the context of UGC but also accentuate the central mediating role of attitude. In addition, the study finds support for perceptual homophily as a critical determinant of both credibility and attitude. Theoretical and managerial implications are highlighted.",
National culture and friendship homophily in the multinational workplace,ASIAN BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT,Jul 2013,2013,"This article argues that cultural differences can be understood in terms of demographic homophily patterns. We test this argument by comparing friendship homophily in nationality and gender between two cultural groups (Korean and American employees) from within a multi-national corporation. Korean employees showed stronger nationality homophily owing to their collectivistic values. Confucian culture strengthened the gender homophily of the East Asian employees, especially female employees. Finally, compared to the Korean employees, the affective closeness of the US employees' friendship ties was significantly affected by friendship tie multiplexity, showing this group's instrumental disposition.",
"IS COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY ""TOO INSULAR""? A NETWORK ANALYSIS OF JOURNAL CITATIONS",JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,Jul 2013,2013,"The current study uses social network analysis to explore one aspect of cross-disciplinary connections in community psychology-citations from articles published in community psychology's main journals (i.e., American Journal of Community Psychology and Journal of Community Psychology) to allied disciplines in 2009. Results indicate that although community psychology journals cited a wide range of disciplines, their levels of citation to any individual journal in another discipline never exceeded 10% of their total network citations. Additionally, journals in other disciplines did not exhibit many citations to community psychology journals. Observed homophily measures indicate that community psychology journals have more cross-disciplinary citations than articles published in the flagship journals of clinical psychology, sociology, and public health. However, relative homophily measures suggest that community psychology journals are also far more likely to cite within discipline than expected by chance. Implications and future directions for cross-disciplinary endeavors in community psychology are suggested.",
Learning to Predict Reciprocity and Triadic Closure in Social Networks,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA,Jul 2013,2013,"We study how links are formed in social networks. In particular, we focus on investigating how a reciprocal (two-way) link, the basic relationship in social networks, is developed from a parasocial (one-way) relationship and how the relationships further develop into triadic closure, one of the fundamental processes of link formation.We first investigate how geographic distance and interactions between users influence the formation of link structure among users. Then we study how social theories including homophily, social balance, and social status are satisfied over networks with parasocial and reciprocal relationships. The study unveils several interesting phenomena. For example, ""friend's friend is a friend"" indeed exists in the reciprocal relationship network, but does not hold in the parasocial relationship network.We propose a learning framework to formulate the problems of predicting reciprocity and triadic closure into a graphical model. We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 90% of reciprocal relationships in a Twitter network. The proposed model also achieves better performance (+20-30% in terms of F1-measure) than several alternative methods for predicting the triadic closure formation.",
Social Ties and User-Generated Content: Evidence from an Online Social Network,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Jun 2013,2013,"We exploit changes in wind speeds at surfing locations in Switzerland as a source of variation in users' propensity to post content about their surfing activity on an online social network. We exploit this variation to test whether users' online content-generation activity is codetermined with their social ties. Economically significant effects of this type can produce positive feedback that generates local network effects in content generation. When quantitatively significant, the increased content and tie density arising from the network effect induces more visitation and browsing on the site, which fuels growth by generating advertising revenue. We find evidence consistent with such network effects.",
Intermarriage Attitudes Among Minority and Majority Groups in Western Europe: The Role of Attachment to the Religious In-Group,INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION,Jun 2013,2013,"The key question of this paper is whether social integration, both for minority (migrants) and majority groups (natives) in Western Europe, varies across contexts of exit (ethnic origins) and contexts of reception (Western European countries); and if so, how does religious identity and practice serve to mediate these contextual differences? To investigate this question I draw on the international comparative dataset EURISLAM which includes comparisons between Muslim migrants of ex-Yugoslav, Turkish, Moroccan and Pakistani origin with majority group members of Belgium, Britain, Germany and Switzerland. Social integration is measured through attitudes towards intermarriage across Muslim/non-Muslim lines. As results show, ethnic groups differ in their probabilities to approve of intermarriage. Especially migrants from the former Yugoslavia encounter a significantly lower approval of intermarriage by natives. However, approval of intermarriage is closely tied to religiosity. Once religiosity is controlled for, all migrant groups become significantly more positive about intermarriage than natives. Following theories on in-group favouritism and the homophily principle, we find that religious identity among migrants and practice among both natives and migrants are associated with reluctance to intermarry. Policy makers are advised to take note that contextual differences in perceived social integration of immigrant groups could be confounding other factors, including how differences in religiosity affect social integration. Migrants' significantly higher approval of intermarriage after controlling religiosity implies that policy makers may conceivably have to shift attention from migrants to natives and undertake some action in order to enable a greater intercultural understanding.",
Considering baseline homophily when generating spatial social networks for agent-based modelling,COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ORGANIZATION THEORY,Jun 2013,2013,"Social networks have become an important part of agent-based models, and their structure may have remarkable impact on simulation results. We propose a simple and efficient but empirically based approach for spatial agent-based models which explicitly takes into account restrictions and opportunities imposed by effects of baseline homophily, i.e. the influence of local socio-demography on the composition of one's social network. Furthermore, the algorithm considers the probability of links that depends on geographical distance between potential partners.The resulting network reflects social settings and furthermore allows the modeller to influence network properties by adjusting agent type specific parameters. Especially the parameter for distance dependence and the probability of distant links allow for control of clustering and agent type distribution of personal networks.",
"Baseball, Beer, and Bulgari: Examining Cultural Capital and Gender Inequality in a Retail Fashion Corporation",JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ETHNOGRAPHY,Jun 2013,2013,"I use cultural capital as a conceptual framework for examining gender inequality at work. While much previous research has been situated in hypermasculine work settings, this study takes place in an industry (retail fashion) and an organization that are not hypermasculine-yet, the company's cultural capital is dominated by men, and a glass ceiling persists. Using ethnographic data collected at the headquarters of a major Midwestern multinational retail corporation, I examine this puzzle. I explain how the cultural capital valued by upper management is gendered and contributes to the maintenance of the glass ceiling, and how members of upper management succeed or fail at activating their cultural capital. I also illustrate how the company's industry and internal structure enable some women and gay men to successfully navigate a men-dominated work culture. In doing so, I attempt to synthesize previous studies on homophily and gendered organizations.",
Friendship similarities in internalizing problems in early childhood,EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY,Jun 2013,2013,"A key factor identified in friendship formation and stability is similarity. Homophily of externalizing problems has been reported frequently, but less attention has been directed at homophily of internalizing problems. Whether young children who are friends resemble each other in their internalizing problems is thus largely unknown. In order to increase understanding of the social risk factors implicated in the etiology of internalizing problems, it is important to establish whether internalizing problems cluster in friendships. The present study examines homophily of internalizing problems while controlling for externalizing problems in a sample of children aged 4-8.Methods: A community sample of 1584 children or 792 dyads with a mean age of 5.85 (SD = 1.26) participated. Of these friendship dyads, 557 were reciprocal and 235 unilateral friends. Internalizing and externalizing problems were reported by teachers.Results: Intraclass correlations were calculated to test for similarities between reciprocal and unilateral friends. Support was found for the homophily hypothesis, in that reciprocal, but not unilateral friends, were substantially similar in their internalizing problems.Conclusions: In reciprocal friendships we found substantial similarity. From these results, we might conclude that homophily is already present in friendships of young children regarding internalizing problems. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Does it pay to have friends? Social ties and executive appointments in banking,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,Jun 2013,2013,"We exploit a unique sample to analyze how homophily (affinity for similar others) and social ties affect career outcomes in banking. We test if these factors increase the probability that the appointee to an executive board is an outsider without previous employment at the bank compared to being an insider. Homophily based on age and gender increase the chances of the outsider appointments. Similar educational backgrounds, in contrast, reduce the chance that the appointee is an outsider. Greater social ties also increase the probability of an outside appointment. Results from a duration model show that larger age differences shorten tenure significantly, whereas gender similarities barely affect tenure. Differences in educational backgrounds affect tenure differently across the banking sectors. Maintaining more contacts to the executive board reduces tenure. We also find weak evidence that social ties are associated with reduced profitability, consistent with cronyism in banking. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Social learning with bounded confidence and heterogeneous agents,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,May 15 2013,2013,"This paper investigates an opinion formation model in social networks with bounded confidence and heterogeneous agents. The network topologies are shaped by the homophily of beliefs, which means any pair of agents are neighbors only if their belief difference is not larger than a positive constant called the bound of confidence. We consider a model with both informed agents and uninformed agents, the essential difference between which is the informed agents have access to outside signals which are function of the underlying true state of the social event concerned. More precisely, the informed agents update their beliefs by combining the Bayesian posterior beliefs based on their private observations and weighted averages of the beliefs of their neighbors. The uninformed agents update their beliefs simply by linearly combining the beliefs of their neighbors. We find that the whole group can learn the true state only if the bound of confidence is larger than a positive threshold which is related to the population density. Furthermore, simulations show that the proportion of informed agents required for collective learning decreases as the population density increases. By tuning the learning speed of informed agents, we find the following: the higher the speed, the shorter the time needed for the whole group to achieve a steady state, and on the other hand, the higher the speed, the lower the proportion of agents with successful learning - there is a trade-off.

Social Interactions and the Labor Market,REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,MAY-JUN 2013,2013,"To better understand the way social networks operate in the labor market, we propose two simple models where individuals help each other finding a job. In the first one, job information flows between individuals having a link with each other and we show that an equilibrium with a clustering of workers with the same status is likely to emerge since, in the long run, employed workers tend to be friends with employed workers. In the second model, individuals interact with both strong and weak ties and decide how much time they spend with each of them. As in Granovetter, this model stresses the strength of weak ties in finding a job because they involve a secondary ring of acquaintances who have contacts with networks outside ego's network and therefore offer new sources of information on job opportunities. We then discuss some policy implications showing how these models can explain why ethnic minorities tend to experience higher unemployment rate than workers from the majority group.",
"A model for the multiplex dynamics of two-mode and one-mode networks, with an application to employment preference, friendship, and advice",SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2013,2013,"We propose a new stochastic actor-oriented model for the co-evolution of two-mode and one-mode networks. The model posits that activities of a set of actors, represented in the two-mode network, co-evolve with exchanges and interactions between the actors, as represented in the one-mode network. The model assumes that the actors, not the activities, have agency.The empirical value of the model is demonstrated by examining how employment preferences co-evolve with friendship and advice relations in a group of seventy-five MBA students. The analysis shows that activity in the two-mode network, as expressed by number of employment preferences, is related to activity in the friendship network, as expressed by outdegrees. Further, advice ties between students lead to agreement with respect to employment preferences. In addition, considering the multiplexity of advice and friendship ties yields a better understanding of the dynamics of the advice relation: tendencies to reciprocation and homophily in advice relations are mediated to an important extent by friendship relations.The discussion pays attention to the implications of this study in the broader context of current efforts to model the co-evolutionary dynamics of social networks and individual behavior.

Top Management's Attention to Discontinuous Technological Change: Corporate Venture Capital as an Alert Mechanism,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,MAY-JUN 2013,2013,"Technological discontinuities pose serious challenges to top managers' attention. These discontinuities, which often JL occur at the fringes of an industry, are usually driven by innovative and (often) venture capital-backed start-ups creating new products and transforming existing industries in ways that are difficult for incumbent managers to understand against the backdrop of their existing cognitive schemata. However, failing to appreciate and embrace successful technological discontinuities might endanger incumbents' very existence. Extending the attention-based view, we explore whether and how interorganizational relationships guide top managers' attention either to or away from technological discontinuities. We propose that homophilous relationships (e.g., alliances with industry peers) should exhibit a negative relationship with incumbents' timely attention to technological discontinuities, whereas heterophilous relationships (e.g., with venture capitalists as a result of coinvestments) should exhibit a positive relationship. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the status of the partners strengthens the effect of homophilous and heterophilous relationships with the timely attention of top managers to technological discontinuities. Based on a longitudinal study of the incumbents in four information and communications technology industry sectors, we find that heterophilous ties through corporate venture capital (CVC), coinvesting with high-status venture capital firms, exhibit a strong positive relationship with timely attention. CVC, when it connects senior management to high-status venture capitalists through coinvestments, has a special role in directing top managers' attention to technological discontinuities and ensuing business opportunities. Implications for the understanding of the role of interorganizational ties as structural determinants of top managers' attention are discussed.",
From Natural Variation to Optimal Policy? The Importance of Endogenous Peer Group Formation,ECONOMETRICA,May 2013,2013,"We take cohorts of entering freshmen at the United States Air Force Academy and assign half to peer groups designed to maximize the academic performance of the lowest ability students. Our assignment algorithm uses nonlinear peer effects estimates from the historical pre-treatment data, in which students were randomly assigned to peer groups. We find a negative and significant treatment effect for the students we intended to help. We provide evidence that within our optimally designed peer groups, students avoided the peers with whom we intended them to interact and instead formed more homogeneous subgroups. These results illustrate how policies that manipulate peer groups for a desired social outcome can be confounded by changes in the endogenous patterns of social interactions within the group.",
"Biased assimilation, homophily, and the dynamics of polarization",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Apr 9 2013,2013,"We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that De Groot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.",
Structures of globalization: Evidence from the worldwide network of bilateral investment treaties (1959-2009),INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY,Apr 2013,2013,"Existing sociological theories of international relations yield contrasting predictions for their structure that range from an increasingly dense and universally tied network to networks in which ties tend to concentrate within or between certain types of economically, politically or culturally defined blocs. We contribute to this growing body of empirical research by analyzing original data on the complete worldwide network of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) as it has evolved over the course of 50 years since its inception in 1959. We find that the number of BITs increases almost exponentially over time to include nearly all of the world's countries. However, the density of ties between advanced capitalist and others is stronger than for any other dyadic types. We also find patterns of regional homophily, but only in Asia, East Asia, Postsocialist Europe and Eurasia, and North Africa/Middle East. These findings suggest that existing explanations of globalization are more complementary than contending. Theorizing about any particular global outcome thus requires attention to the simultaneity of material and cultural forces and the interplay of transnational and local socio-historical developments. Our analysis of the structure of the BIT network also helps explain the weak link between foreign direct investment and BITs discovered in previous research.",
Friend similarity in attitudes toward bullying and sense of responsibility to intervene,SOCIAL INFLUENCE,Apr 1 2013,2013,"This study investigated reciprocal friends' similarity in attitudes toward bullying and responsibility for intervention in favor of the victim among 1485 Italian children (mean age=10 years, 3 months) and adolescents (mean age=13 years, 2 months). Findings of two linear regressions confirmed that friend homophily exists in relation to both students' attitudes and responsibility. This result was retained even after individual and friends' bullying and defending behavior were controlled. Similarity between friends emerged particularly when the proportion of reciprocal friends in the classroom was high. Finally, age and gender moderated the relation between individual's and friends' attitudes. These results significantly expand previous findings related to social influences in the bullying phenomenon and have potential interest for researchers and educators.",
Birds of a feather: homophily and sexual network structure in sub-Saharan Africa,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS,Mar 2013,2013,"Sexual partner homophily is the tendency of individuals to choose partners similar to themselves. The extent and nature of partner homophily influences the structure of sexual networks and hence the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In this paper, we compare homophily by ethnicity, age and educational status in representative populations from five African cities in Benin (Cotonou), Cameroon (Yaounde), Kenya (Kisumu), Zambia (Ndola) and South Africa (Carletonville). We find low rates of homophily by age and high rates for educational status throughout the region. There is a large variation in homophily by ethnicity between these five cities, with rates lowest in Ndola. In Carletonville, there is a gendered difference in homophily by ethnicity. We discuss the possible implications these variations in the extent and type of homophily may have for STI transmission in the region.",
"Substitution and Stratification: The Interplay between Dyadic and Systemic Proximity in Global Trade, 1993-2005",SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,SPR 2013,2013,"This article examines the interplay of homophily (similarity breeds connection) at two levels in international tradedyadic similarity (geographic, political, and cultural proximity) and systemic similarity (structural equivalence and world-system status). First, there is a substitution effect between dyadic homophily and systemic homophily from structural equivalence. Both types of homophily generate favorable social structure that facilitates international trade. The existence of structural equivalence lessens the dependence of bilateral trade on dyadic homophily. Second, there is a stratification effect of world-system status on dyadic homophily. Geographic homophily matters the most for bilateral trade between two noncore countries, while political and cultural homophily is the most influential for trade between a core country and a noncore country. These two findings have important implications. The substitution effect of structural equivalence prevents international trade from complete fragmentation along geographic, political, and cultural lines, while the stratification effect of world-system status reveals unequal capacity across countries to overcome the structural constraints imposed by dyadic homophily.",
"Men's Migration, Women's Personal Networks, and Responses to HIV/AIDS in Mozambique",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Mar 2013,2013,"This study brings together the literature on social network approaches to social capital and health and on migration and HIV risks to examine how non-migrating wives of labor migrants use their personal networks to cope with perceived risks of HIV infection in rural southern Mozambique. Using data from a 2006 survey of 1,680 women and their dyadic interactions, we compare the composition of personal networks, HIV/AIDS communication, and preventive behavior of women married to migrants and those married to non-migrants. Results show that migrants' wives were more likely than non-migrants' wives to have other migrants' wives as personal network members, to engage in HIV/AIDS communication, and to discuss HIV prevention. However, they were no more likely to talk about HIV/AIDS with migrants' wives than with non-migrants' wives. They were also no more likely to talk about AIDS and its prevention than non-migrants' wives who express worry about HIV infection from their spouses. Finally, we detect that network members' prevention behavior was similar to respondents', although this did not depend on migration. We contextualize these findings within the literature and discuss their policy implications.",
Group design with endogenous associations,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,Mar 2013,2013,"The belief that people are affected by the groups in which they are active has long led policy makers to manipulate the groups to which people are exposed. This paper studies the optimal design of groups to maximize racial and ethnic integration. We show that the group composition that maximizes integration of associations depends critically on the strength of homophily in an intuitive way. We use data on associations among high school students to measure actual integration. We find that non-Hispanics and Hispanics integrate even in groups that are heavily mixed, but that non-blacks do not integrate with blacks until most of a group is black. Consequently, schools with even mixes of Hispanics and non-Hispanics maximize ethnic integration, whereas integration of non-blacks and blacks is maximized with relatively uneven distributions of blacks and non-blacks (i.e. in groups that appear not to be very integrated at all).

Race and Reciprocity: Inter-household Exchanges in a Multiracial Neighborhood,SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM,Mar 2013,2013,"This study investigates the degree to which African-American households are socially integrated into a multiracial, middle-class suburban neighborhood near Dallas, Texas. Although U.S. neighborhoods are becoming increasingly heterogeneous in composition, little is known about black households' participation in social and informational networks within multiracial middle-class neighborhoods. Drawing on theories of the gift and social capital, we view neighborhoods in terms of complex patterns of inter-household exchanges of material and symbolic goods. We predict that black-led households will exchange at a lower rate with their neighbors than will other households and test this prediction using survey data collected from 119 households and from follow-up interviews with eight black heads of household. Our main finding from the survey is that black households exchanged at a significantly lower rate than did other households, ceteris paribus. The follow-up interviews found little evidence of black racial homophily in neighboring or of racism within the neighborhood. However, the low rate of black inter-household exchanges may be partly explained by black head of households' personal experiences of racism outside the neighborhood and by a racially constituted disposition against borrowing from neighbors. We discuss implications of our findings for research on racial integration and segregation.",
What Friendship Entails: An Empirical Analysis of Graduate Students' Social Networks,SOCIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM,Mar 1 2013,2013,"This article uses network analysis to explore interpersonal relationships among three cohorts of sociology graduate students. We examine the content of graduate student relationships to consider questions of friendship formation among adults in a naturally bounded university setting. Drawing on existing research on friendship formation, we also analyze the extent to which tendencies toward race and gender homophily persist among graduate students. We find that graduate students' friendships tend to be at low levels of intimacy and gender and race homophilous. We discuss these findings in the context of recent research showing that American adults have fewer intimate relationships, and discuss the implications of race and gender based exclusionary friendship networks for the discipline of sociology as well as within broader organizational contexts.",
Egocentric social network analysis of pathological gambling,ADDICTION,Mar 2013,2013,"Aims To apply social network analysis (SNA) to investigate whether frequency and severity of gambling problems were associated with different network characteristics among friends, family and co-workers is an innovative way to look at relationships among individuals; the current study was the first, to our knowledge, to apply SNA to gambling behaviors. Design Egocentric social network analysis was used to characterize formally the relationships between social network characteristics and gambling pathology. Setting Laboratory-based questionnaire and interview administration. Participants Forty frequent gamblers (22 non-pathological gamblers, 18 pathological gamblers) were recruited from the community. Measurements and Findings The SNA revealed significant social network compositional differences between the two groups: pathological gamblers (PGs) had more gamblers, smokers and drinkers in their social networks than did non-pathological gamblers (NPGs). PGs had more individuals in their network with whom they personally gambled, smoked and drank than those with who were NPG. Network ties were closer to individuals in their networks who gambled, smoked and drank more frequently. Associations between gambling severity and structural network characteristics were not significant. Conclusions Pathological gambling is associated with compositional but not structural differences in social networks. Pathological gamblers differ from non-pathological gamblers in the number of gamblers, smokers and drinkers in their social networks. Homophily within the networks also indicates that gamblers tend to be closer with other gamblers. This homophily may serve to reinforce addictive behaviors, and may suggest avenues for future study or intervention.",
Integrated or Disconnected? Examining Formal and Informal Networks in a Merged Nonprofit Organization,NONPROFIT MANAGEMENT & LEADERSHIP,SPR 2013,2013,"This article introduces nonprofit researchers and practitioners to a social network analytical technique for assessing internal staff relationships after a merger. We studied a case of a nonprofit merger, investigating its formal and informal intraorganizational networks to see which parts integrated and which remained separate operationally. We discovered a prior-organizational-affiliation-based homophily within the merged organization: most interpersonal relationships existing within these networks remained among the employees who worked together prior to the merger. However, the informal and expressive networks of mentoring, friendship, and socioemotional support were even more disconnected than the formal and instrumental networks of work relationships and problem solving. We highlight the role of a mentoring network in bridging formal and informal networks in a merged organization.",
Comparing General and Political Discussion Networks Within Voluntary Organizations Using Social Network Analysis,POLITICAL BEHAVIOR,Mar 2013,2013,"Political discussion networks are influenced by the opportunities for political interactions within our larger social environments and more general discussion networks. In this study we compare general and political discussion networks using full sociometric social network data from a probability sample of voluntary organizations-specifically, intact student activity groups from a large Midwest research university. We find that even within these ""weak tie"" voluntary associations, general discussion networks clearly constrain the characteristics of the political discussion networks. However, political discussion networks appear to be less dense and more likely to be broken up into disconnected components than the general discussion networks. But, general and political networks do not appear to differ in their structuring by perceptions of discussant knowledge. And, most interestingly, we find that on average neither general nor political discussion networks are characterized by political homogeneity.",
"Topological and Historical Considerations for Infectious Disease Transmission among Injecting Drug Users in Bushwick, Brooklyn (USA).",World journal of AIDS,2013-Mar-01,2013,"Recent interest by physicists in social networks and disease transmission factors has prompted debate over the topology of degree distributions in sexual networks. Social network researchers have been critical of ""scale-free"" Barabasi-Albert approaches, and largely rejected the preferential attachment, ""rich-get-richer"" assumptions that underlie that model. Instead, research on sexual networks has pointed to the importance of homophily and local sexual norms in dictating degree distributions, and thus disease transmission thresholds. Injecting Drug User (IDU) network topologies may differ from the emerging models of sexual networks, however. Degree distribution analysis of a Brooklyn, NY, IDU network indicates a different topology than the spanning tree configurations discussed for sexual networks, instead featuring comparatively short cycles and high concurrency. Our findings suggest that IDU networks do in some ways conform to a ""scale-free"" topology, and thus may represent ""reservoirs"" of potential infection despite seemingly low transmission thresholds.",
Social contagion theory: examining dynamic social networks and human behavior,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,Feb 20 2013,2013,"Here, we review the research we have conducted on social contagion. We describe the methods we have employed (and the assumptions they have entailed) to examine several datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses, including the Framingham Heart Study, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and other observational and experimental datasets that we and others have collected. We describe the regularities that led us to propose that human social networks may exhibit a three degrees of influence property, and we review statistical approaches we have used to characterize interpersonal influence with respect to phenomena as diverse as obesity, smoking, cooperation, and happiness. We do not claim that this work is the final word, but we do believe that it provides some novel, informative, and stimulating evidence regarding social contagion in longitudinally followed networks. Along with other scholars, we are working to develop new methods for identifying causal effects using social network data, and we believe that this area is ripe for statistical development as current methods have known and often unavoidable limitations.

Inference for influence over multiple degrees of separation on a social network,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,Feb 20 2013,2013,"States and behaviors of different individuals are expected to be correlated across a social network. Christakis and Fowler have proposed a three degrees of influence rule to characterize the extent of such dependence. In this paper, we discuss three distinct interpretations of such a rule, one involving only associations (which is the interpretation for which Christakis and Fowler give evidence), one involving actual causation, generally referred to as contagion or social influence, and one involving direct effects. We discuss analytic procedures appropriate for assessing evidence for each possible interpretation and the increasingly difficult methodological challenges present in each interpretation.

Potential Theory for Directed Networks,PLOS ONE,Feb 11 2013,2013,"Uncovering factors underlying the network formation is a long-standing challenge for data mining and network analysis. In particular, the microscopic organizing principles of directed networks are less understood than those of undirected networks. This article proposes a hypothesis named potential theory, which assumes that every directed link corresponds to a decrease of a unit potential and subgraphs with definable potential values for all nodes are preferred. Combining the potential theory with the clustering and homophily mechanisms, it is deduced that the Bi-fan structure consisting of 4 nodes and 4 directed links is the most favored local structure in directed networks. Our hypothesis receives strongly positive supports from extensive experiments on 15 directed networks drawn from disparate fields, as indicated by the most accurate and robust performance of Bi-fan predictor within the link prediction framework. In summary, our main contribution is twofold: (i) We propose a new mechanism for the local organization of directed networks; (ii) We design the corresponding link prediction algorithm, which can not only testify our hypothesis, but also find out direct applications in missing link prediction and friendship recommendation.",
How women organize social networks different from men,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Feb 7 2013,2013,"Superpositions of social networks, such as communication, friendship, or trade networks, are called multiplex networks, forming the structural backbone of human societies. Novel datasets now allow quantification and exploration of multiplex networks. Here we study gender-specific differences of a multiplex network from a complete behavioral dataset of an online-game society of about 300,000 players. On the individual level females perform better economically and are less risk-taking than males. Males reciprocate friendship requests from females faster than vice versa and hesitate to reciprocate hostile actions of females. On the network level females have more communication partners, who are less connected than partners of males. We find a strong homophily effect for females and higher clustering coefficients of females in trade and attack networks. Cooperative links between males are under-represented, reflecting competition for resources among males. These results confirm quantitatively that females and males manage their social networks in substantially different ways.",
Load balanced diffusive capture process on homophilic scale-free networks,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Feb 1 2013,2013,"Diffusive capture processes are known to be an effective method for information search on complex networks. The biased N lions-lamb model provides quick search time by attracting random walkers to high degree nodes, where most capture events take place. The price of the efficiency is extreme traffic concentration on top hubs. We propose traffic load balancing provided by type specific biased random walks. For that we introduce a multi-type scale-free graph generation model, which embeds homophily structure into the network by utilizing type dependent random walks. We show analytically and with simulations that by augmenting the biased random walk method with a simple type homophily rule, we can alleviate the traffic concentration on high degree nodes by spreading the load proportionally between hubs with different types of our generated multi-type scale-free topologies.

Genetic relatedness does not predict racoon social network structure,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,Feb 2013,2013,"Social assortativity, preferentially associating with certain individuals, is a widespread behaviour among a diverse range of taxa. Animals often choose to associate with other individuals based on characteristics such as sex, age, body size, rank and genetic relatedness. These preferences can scale up to shape the overall social structure of an animal group or population. We investigated possible factors that might shape the social network structure of common racoons, Procyon lotor, in a high-density urban population in Cook County, Illinois, U. S. A. Racoon associations were recorded using proximity detecting radiocollars that recorded when individuals came within 1-1.5 m of each other. In addition, dyadic measures of home range overlap and genetic relatedness were calculated for all individuals included in our study. We used multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures to determine what factors influenced the structure of racoon association networks. The only variable that positively influenced racoon social structure was male-male homophily, which is consistent with previous studies that documented frequent social interactions between adult male racoons. Genetic relatedness had no effect on racoon social networks and there was no evidence that males or females preferentially associated with close relatives, despite the presence of kin in the population. This pattern, that kinship does not play a significant role in shaping social structure, is strikingly unusual among mammals and is not consistent with many socioecological models. Although racoon individuals showed strong social partner preferences, it is unclear what factors drove these choices. This unpredictability in partner choice shaped the structure of the racoon social networks and has important implications for disease transfer in this widespread animal vector.

Scale-free homophilic network,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B,Feb 2013,2013,"An important aspect governing the growth of complex networks is homophily, which is defined as the tendency of sites to link with others which are similar to themselves. Here, we modify the preferential attachment from Barabasi-Albert model by including a homophilic term. Comparisons are made with the Barabasi-Albert model, fitness model and our present model considering its topological properties: degree distribution, time dependence of the connectivity, shortest path length and clustering coefficient. We verify the existence of a region where the characteristics of sites play an important role in the rate of gaining links as well as in the number of links between sites with similar and dissimilar characteristics.",
"Homophily, networks, and critical mass: Solving the start-up problem in large group collective action",RATIONALITY AND SOCIETY,Feb 2013,2013,"Formal theories of collective action face the problem that in large groups a single actor makes such a small impact on the collective good that cooperation is irrational. Critical mass theorists argue that this 'large group problem' can be solved by an initial critical mass of contributors, whose efforts can produce a 'bandwagon' effect, making cooperation rational for the remaining members of the population. However, critical mass theory requires an explanation of how a critical mass can form in the first place. I present a model of collective action that solves this problem by showing how aspects of social structure - including network topology, homophily, and local coalition formation - can allow rational actors to endogenously form a critical mass. The findings indicate that as the mobilization effort becomes more 'complex', clustered networks and homophily become increasingly important for critical mass collective action.",
Estimating Causal Installed-Base Effects: A Bias-Correction Approach,JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH,Feb 2013,2013,"New empirical models of consumer demand that incorporate social effects seek to measure the causal effect of past adopter's behavior the ""installed-base"" on current adoption behavior. Identifying such causal effects is challenging due to several alternative confounds that generate correlation in agents' actions. In the absence of experimental variation, a preferred solution has been to control for these spurious correlations using a rich specification of fixed effects. The authors show that fixed-effects estimators of this sort are inconsistent in the presence of installed-base effects; in simulations, random-effects specifications perform even worse. The analysis reveals the tension the applied empiricist faces in this area: a rich control for unobservables increases the credibility of the reported causal effects, but the incorporation of these controls introduces biases of a new kind in this class of models. The authors present two solutions: a modified version of an instrumental variable approach and a new bias-correction approach, both of which deliver consistent estimates of causal installed-base effects. The empirical application to the adoption of the Toyota Prius Hybrid in California shows evidence for social influence in diffusion and reveals that implementing the bias correction reverses the sign of the measured installed-base effect. The authors also discuss implications of the results for identification of models in marketing involving state dependence in demand, and incorporating discrete games of strategic interaction.",
"Adolescent Girls' Friendship Networks, Body Dissatisfaction, and Disordered Eating: Examining Selection and Socialization Processes",JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,Feb 2013,2013,"Previous research has shown that adolescent girls tend to resemble their friends in their level of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. However, no studies to date have attempted to disentangle the underlying peer selection and socialization processes that may explain this homophily. The current study used longitudinal stochastic actor-based modeling to simultaneously examine these two processes in a large community sample of adolescent girls (N = 1,197) from nine Australian girls' high schools. Friendship nominations and measures of body dissatisfaction, dieting and bulimic behaviors were collected across three annual waves. Results indicated that selection rather than socialization effects contributed to similarity within friendship groups when both processes were examined simultaneously. Specifically, girls tended to select friends who were similar to themselves in terms of body dissatisfaction and bulimic behaviors, but dissimilar in terms of dieting. Network and individual attribute variables also emerged as significant in explaining changes in adolescents' friendships and behaviors. As well as having important clinical implications, the findings point to the importance of controlling for friendship selection when examining the role of peers in adolescent body image and eating problems.",
"Effectiveness of Respondent Driven Sampling to Recruit Undocumented Central American Immigrant Women in Houston, Texas for an HIV Behavioral Survey",AIDS AND BEHAVIOR,Feb 2013,2013,"Respondent driven sampling (RDS) is widely used for HIV behavioral research among sex workers, drug users, and other hidden populations, but has had limited application in immigrant populations in the U.S. In 2010, we used RDS to recruit undocumented Central American immigrant women in Houston, Texas for an HIV behavioral survey. Beginning with three initial participants we recruited 226 women within 16 weeks. Social networks were dense and participants adopted the recruitment system with reasonable ease. Homophily scores indicated moderate within-group preference by country of origin. However, cross-group recruitment was sufficient to achieve a diverse sample that attained equilibrium for all demographic and sexual behavior characteristics. Overall, RDS was easy to implement, attained a large sample in a relatively short period of time, and reached an otherwise hidden population. Our results suggest that RDS is an effective method for recruiting undocumented Latina immigrants for HIV behavioral surveys.",
The Duality of Clusters and Statistical Interactions,SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH,Feb 2013,2013,"We contend that clusters of cases co-constitute statistical interactions among variables. Interactions among variables imply clusters of cases within which statistical effects differ. Regression coefficients may be productively viewed as sums across clusters of cases, and in this sense regression coefficients may be said to be ""composed"" of clusters of cases. We explicate a four-step procedure that discovers interaction effects based on clusters of cases in the data matrix, hence aiding in inductive model specification. We illustrate with two examples. One is a reanalysis of data from a published study of the effect of social welfare policy extensiveness on poverty rates across 15 countries. The second uses General Social Survey data to predict four different dimensions of ego-network homophily. We find support for our contention that clusters of the rows of a data matrix may be exploited to discover statistical interactions among variables that improve model fit.",
Differentiation without Distancing. Explaining Bi-Polarization of Opinions without Negative Influence,Figshare,2016-01-15,2013,"Explanations of opinion bi-polarization hinge on the assumption of negative influence, individuals striving to amplify differences to disliked others. However, empirical evidence for negative influence is inconclusive, which motivated us to search for an alternative explanation. Here, we demonstrate that bi-polarization can be explained without negative influence, drawing on theories that emphasize the communication of arguments as central mechanism of influence. Due to homophily, actors interact mainly with others whose arguments will intensify existing tendencies for or against the issue at stake. We develop an agent-based model of this theory and compare its implications to those of existing social-influence models, deriving testable hypotheses about the conditions of bi-polarization. Hypotheses were tested with a group-discussion experiment (N = 96). Results demonstrate that argument exchange can entail bi-polarization even when there is no negative influence.",
"Feasibility of Recruiting a Diverse Sample of Men Who Have Sex with Men: Observation from Nanjing, China",Figshare,2016-01-15,2013,"BackgroundRespondent-driven-sampling (RDS) has well been recognized as a method for sampling from most hard-to-reach populations like commercial sex workers, drug users and men who have sex with men. However the feasibility of this sampling strategy in terms of recruiting a diverse spectrum of these hidden populations has not been understood well yet in developing countries.MethodsIn a cross sectional study in Nanjing city of Jiangsu province of China, 430 MSM were recruited including 9 seeds in 14 weeks of study period using RDS. Information regarding socio-demographic characteristics and sexual risk behavior were collected and testing was done for HIV and syphilis. Duration, completion, participant characteristics and the equilibrium of key factors were used for assessing feasibility of RDS. Homophily of key variables, socio-demographic distribution and social network size were used as the indicators of diversity.ResultsIn the study sample, adjusted HIV and syphilis prevalence were 6.6% and 14.6% respectively. Majority (96.3%) of the participants were recruited by members of their own social network. Although there was a tendency for recruitment within the same self-identified group (homosexuals recruited 60.0% homosexuals), considerable cross-group recruitment (bisexuals recruited 52.3% homosexuals) was also seen. Homophily of the self-identified sexual orientations was 0.111 for homosexuals. Upon completion of the recruitment process, participant characteristics and the equilibrium of key factors indicated that RDS was feasible for sampling MSM in Nanjing. Participants recruited by RDS were found to be diverse after assessing the homophily of key variables in successive waves of recruitment, the proportion of characteristics after reaching equilibrium and the social network size. The observed design effects were nearly the same or even better than the theoretical design effect of 2.ConclusionRDS was found to be an efficient and feasible sampling method for recruiting a diverse sample of MSM in a reasonable time.",

"Shared Knowledge: Eliminating the ""Ba""","PROCEEDINGS OF THE 14TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (ECKM 2013), VOLS 1 AND 2",2013,2013,"In one of the supreme ironies in ICT, social networking (SN) companies such as Facebook, search engine (SE) companies such as Google, and other major knowledge management (KM) organizations continue to rely on Nonaka and Konno's (1998) ""Ba,"" or physical space, for the internal creation and management of new ideas. Apparently, these companies believe employees still need to congregate in a physical place - an office - in order to share ideas, as opposed to creating and sharing knowledge in a totally virtual environment. In this theoretical exploration of physical space I propose that the next challenge facing knowledge management is eliminating the ""Ba,"" and in this paper we examine how that will facilitate the successful sharing of knowledge in a world where place truly ceases to have meaning. The challenge is formidable, because human beings still seem to require a common time and place to meet in order to be synchronous. We see this in all aspects of our lives, from our work offices to our educational institutions. Although we have become adept at knowledge sharing in virtual spaces in an asynchronous mode, we are still bound by the chains of human culture and psychology in the synchronous mode. The reason seems to be that we still rely on physical places to reference and give organization to human societies, and thereby provide the conditions for what sociologists refer to as homophily. Makela et al (2007) have shown that we still tend to share knowledge to a greater degree with people who resemble us, or share our cultural identities, but Jameson (2007) has shown that in a globalized world, where national borders have become blurred, it can no longer be presumed that cultural identity is equivalent to nation, or to some shared physical space. In fact, in virtual spaces we need to accept that knowledge will increasingly be created and shared by individuals who are not homophilous, as discussed by Murthy (2013) in regard to Twitter, and therefore need to adapt to a world without ""Ba"". Nonaka et al (2000) have identified four types of ""Ba"": originating ""Ba"", dialoguing ""Ba"", systemising ""Ba"" and exercising ""Ba"". This paper will look at each of these ""Ba"" and how they could be eliminated. Nonaka has stated that although ""Ba"" resemble Wenger's (1999) communities of practice (CoPs), ""Ba"" need energy to operate, while communities of practice remain functional, to some extent, even though they are neither nurtured nor maintained. I believe it is this need for energy that limits the ""Ba,"" and ultimately limits our ability to optimally engage in knowledge sharing in a world where space and place holds less and less meaning for more and more people. When we are finally able to expend less energy clinging to our ""Ba"", we will have more time and energy for creating the knowledge and ideas that were the reasons people first began to construct their ""Ba"" - their physical communities of practice - in a time and place before the existence of what we now know as cyberspace.",
A Multiple Feature Integration Model to Infer Occupation from Social Media Records,"WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING - WISE 2013, PT II",2013,2013,"With the rapid development of more and more social media applications, lots of users are connected with friends and their daily life and opinions are recorded. Social media provides us an unprecedented way to collect and analyze billions of users' information. Proper user attribute identification or profile inference becomes more and more attractive and feasible. However, the flourishing social records also pose great challenge in effective feature selection and integration for user profile inference. This is mainly caused by the text sparsity and complex community structures.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to infer user's occupation from his/her social activities recorded in micro-blog message streams. A multi-source integrated classification model is set up with some fine selected features. We first identify some beneficial basic content features, and then we proceed to tailor a community discovery based latent dimension solution to extract community features.Extensive empirical studies are conducted on a large real micro-blog dataset. Not only we demonstrate the integrated model shows advantages over several baseline methods, but also we verify the effect of homophily in users' interaction records. The different effects of heterogeneous interactive networks are also revealed.",
Hyperlink Prediction in Hypernetworks Using Latent Social Features,DISCOVERY SCIENCE,2013,2013,"Predicting the existence of links between pairwise objects in networks is a key problem in the study of social networks. However, relationships among objects are often more complex than simple pairwise relations. By restricting attention to dyads, it is possible that information valuable for many learning tasks can be lost. The hypernetwork relaxes the assumption that only two nodes can participate in a link, permitting instead an arbitrary number of nodes to participate in so-called hyperlinks or hyperedges, which is a more natural representation for complex, multi-party relations. However, the hyperlink prediction problem has yet to be studied. In this paper, we propose HPLSF (Hyperlink Prediction using Latent Social Features), a hyperlink prediction algorithm for hypernetworks. By exploiting the homophily property of social networks, HPLSF explores social features for hyperlink prediction. To handle the problem that social features are not always observable, a latent social feature learning scheme is developed. To cope with the arbitrary cardinality hyperlink issue in hypernetworks, we design a feature-embedding scheme to map the a priori arbitrarily-sized feature set associated with each hyperlink into a uniformly-sized auxiliary space. To address the fact that observed features and latent features may be not independent, we generalize a structural SVM to learn using both observed features and latent features. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed HPLSF framework on three large-scale hypernetwork datasets. Our results on the three diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the HPLSF algorithm. Although developed in the context of social networks, HPLSF is a general methodology and applies to arbitrary hypernetworks.",
Identifying Same Wavelength Groups from Twitter: A Sentiment Based Approach,"INTELLIGENT INFORMATION AND DATABASE SYSTEMS (ACIIDS 2013), PT II",2013,2013,"Social scientists have identified several network relationships and dimensions that induce homophily. Sentiments or opinions towards different issues have been observed as a key dimension which characterizes human behavior. Twitter is an online social medium where rapid communication takes place publicly. People usually express their sentiments towards various issues. Different persons from different walks of social life may share same opinion towards various issues. When these persons constitute a group, such groups can be conveniently termed same wavelength groups. We propose a novel framework based on sentiments to identify such same wavelength groups from twitter domain.

The merits of the models introduced in this paper are their wide applicability to surveys that collect data on egocentric social networks and their ability to identify the determinants of agreement between subjects' and their friends' attitudinal or behavioral outcomes, controlling for the tendency to agree because of homophily in the choice of friends. An illustrative application from the Japanese General Social Survey data shows that several substantively distinct characteristics of egocentric networks affect subjects' political party preferences and the extent of agreement between the political party preferences of subjects and their significant others.",

IMPACT OF HOMOPHILY ON DIFFUSION DYNAMICS OVER SOCIAL NETWORKS,PROCEEDINGS 27TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION ECMS 2013,2013,2013,"The purpose of this study is to find out under what conditions homophily reinforce the diffusions over social networks or undermines them. To realize this aim, formal modeling approach is utilized and an Agent-Based Model is constructed. Afterwards, diffusion of a non-sticky innovation is investigated with the experiments having varying homophily levels in a social network with two distinct kinds of agents as the primary control variable. The results show that (i) homophily reinforces itself (ii) looking at the macro-behavior of the diffusion, initial increases in the level of homophily has a positive effect on adopted fraction of the population whereas further increases have a negative impact, and (iii) looking at the micro-behavior of the diffusion, increasing homophily can result in local maxima even the macro trend is decreasing. Connectedness and average degrees interacting with social persuasion are the two explanatory remarks in the course of investigating the impact of homophily. As a by-product, the model is also capable of capturing the segregation dynamics over social networks. Future research involves allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily, exploration of the different diffusion initiation types and adoption heuristics.",
Statistical Selection of Congruent Subspaces for Mining Attributed Graphs,2013 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING (ICDM),2013,2013,"Current mining algorithms for attributed graphs exploit dependencies between attribute information and edge structure, referred to as homophily. However, techniques fail if this assumption does not hold for the full attribute space. In multivariate spaces, some attributes have high dependency with the graph structure while others do not show any dependency. Hence, it is important to select congruent subspaces (i.e., subsets of the node attributes) showing dependencies with the graph structure.In this work, we propose a method for the statistical selection of such congruent subspaces. More specifically, we define a measure which assesses the degree of congruence between a set of attributes and the entire graph. We use it as the core of a statistical test, which congruent subspaces must pass. To illustrate its applicability to common graph mining tasks and in order to evaluate our selection scheme, we apply it to community outlier detection. Our selection of congruent subspaces enhances outlier detection by measuring outlierness scores in selected subspaces only. Experiments on attributed graphs show that our approach outperforms traditional full space approaches and gives way to better outlier detection.",
Inferring Community Structure in Healthcare Forums An Empirical Study,METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE,2013,2013,"Background: Detecting community structures in complex networks is a problem interesting to several domains. In healthcare, discovering communities may enhance the quality of web offerings for people with chronic diseases. Understanding the social dynamics and community attachments is key to predicting and influencing interaction and information flow to the right patients.Objectives: The goal of the study is to empirically assess the extent to which we can infer meaningful community structures from implicit networks of peer interaction in online healthcare forums.Methods: We used datasets from five online diabetes forums to design networks based on peer-interactions. A quality function based on user interaction similarity was used to assess the quality of the discovered communities to complement existing homophily measures.Results: Results show that we can infer meaningful communities by observing forum interactions. Closely similar users tended to co-appear in the top communities, suggesting the discovered communities are intuitive. The number of years since diagnosis was a significant factor for cohesiveness in some diabetes communities.Conclusion: Network analysis is a tool that can be useful in studying implicit networks that form in healthcare forums. Current analysis informs further work on predicting and influencing interaction, information flow and user interests that could be useful for personalizing medical social media.",
Diversity in action: Interpersonal networks and the distribution of advice,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Jan 2013,2013,"Does diversity beget the active dissemination of social support in the form of advice to others? Previous research by Robert Putnam suggests that individuals in compositionally diverse geographical areas become closed off from their social ties and less trusting of others, which are both antithetical to social support exchange. We argue, however, that studies of compositional diversity are ill-suited to reflect diversity as it is actually lived and experienced in social life. Drawing from the first nationally representative study with comprehensive indicators of interactional diversity in social life, we analyze self-reports of advice-giving across a variety of social roles. Results of regression analysis are consistent: greater interactional diversity is positively associated with advice-giving, whether the target is stranger, neighbor, close friend, or family member. These findings hold independent of important covariates such as reciprocity, sociability, and homophily. This research contributes to a growing literature set on identifying the unanticipated benefits of diversity in modern society. In sum, we call future research to consider not only diversity in structure, but also diversity in action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Microblogging Personalized Recommendation Based on Ego Networks,"2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCES ON WEB INTELLIGENCE (WI) AND INTELLIGENT AGENT TECHNOLOGIES (IAT), VOL 1",2013,2013,"Microblogging recommendation is to find useful microblogging messages that users are really interested in. Existing methods of microblogging recommendation have low personalization for the reason of focusing on the whole microblogging social network. On microblogging site, different users have different active degree, and different users have considerable variability in structures of followees or followers. It is therefore most necessary to understand microblogging from an individual user's perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel model of microblogging recommendation based on ego networks, called EgoRec, which has the ability of capturing personal interests more accurately. Specifically, the key idea of EgoRec is to make recommendation by homophily of ego networks. We take egos as target users being recommended, while alters as source users for recommendation. Homophily between individual users can be measured by ego profile factors and ego-alter social relations. We define three main social relations in ego networks: support relation, affinity relation and focal relation for recommendation. Moreover, by detecting latent factor and combining with the homophily factors in ego networks, it makes EgoRec more personalized. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the EgoRec model.",
Ethnic Insularity among 1.5- and Second-Generation Korean-American Christians,Development and Society,2013,2013,"Building on insights from Min’s (2010) comparisons between Korean Protestants and Indian Hindus, and my findings of elite freshmen Korean racial insularity (Park 2012), I use data from the Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (2004) survey to examine the extent to which religion serves to not only preserve ethnicity but also support insularity in young adult 1.5- and second-generation (“second generation”hereafter) Korean Americans. Findings suggest that at the racial level of comparison,second-generation Korean-American endogamy resembles that of white, black, and Latino endogamy; second-generation Korean-American endogamy reflects not only the highest intraracial marriage rate, but also the highest intraethnic marriage rate of all Asian groups in the sample. Further, religious married second-generation Korean Americans have the highest racially homogeneous composition rate in the congregations they attend relative to other racial groups and other Asian ethnicities. In multivariate analyses, these two dynamics of marital endogamy and congregational racial homophily produce strong effects on one another and diminish the unique Korean effect. Findings suggest that these group relational patterns are more evident for second-generation Korean Americans and may have implications for social mobility in a racialized context.",
Gender-specific Bullying Dynamics among Korean Middle School Students: Hierarchical vs. Bilateral,Health and Social Science,2013,2013,"This study has two-fold research goals. First, it tries to identify effects of friends onbullying experiences among Korean middle school students. Two types of friend effectsare examined: the number of close friends and the number of close friends who havebullying experiences. Second, it examines if bullying dynamics identified by theconfiguration of friend effects are different between boys and girls. For these purposes,we relied on the 2,656 sample of middle school students from the Korean Child-YouthWell-Being Index that collected a representative sample of Korean adolescents. Unlikecommon senses, bullying experiences somewhat evenly occur across the middle schooladolescents. One of the most robust factors that are associated with bullying experiencesis the number of friends who are victimized or perpetrating. In other words, whiletraditional individual-level characteristics are not enough to explain bullying experience,we can confirm strong homophily in the bullying dynamics: bullying adolescents tend tohave bullies as friends and also victims tend to have victims as friends. However, theconcrete bullying dynamics are quite different across gender. Bullying dynamics amongboys reveals strong hierarchical system where bullying is a cause and result ofstatus-seeking behaviors. Among girls, bullying behaviors seem to be much more bilateralbetween rather equivalent groups.",
TV Audience Flow and Channel Dynamics  Analysis of Audience Duplication with Panel Data of  2009 and 2012,Korean Journal of Broadcasting and Telecommunication Studies,2013,2013,"The concepts of audience fragmentation and polarization have been frequently discussed in examining the change in audience viewing pattern,along with the rapid increase in the number of TV channels. Previous studies have relied on the viewing share of TV channels to examine fragmentation and the channel repertoire of viewers to examine polarization.Acknowledging the limitation of these approaches, Webster and Ksiazek (2012) proposed audience-centric approach using network analysis as a key method. Based on this approach, the present study examines TV audience flow and channel dynamics by analyzing audience duplication between 2009and 2012 with panel data composed of 841 people. The results suggest that audience fragmentation was not on the increase and the rich-get-richer phenomenon existed in the audience flow. In addition, the number of core channels increased and the reliance of periphery channels on core channels also increased, which implies that audience polarization did not grow at least.The change in the audience flow was influenced by genre rather than channel type, and homophily phenomenon existed in the relationship between terrestrial TV channels and their affiliated cable channels as well as between terrestrial TV channels and general-service channels.",
"Determinants of eWOM Behavior of SNS Users : With Emphasis on Personal Characteristics, SNS Traits, Interpersonal Influence, Social Capital",The Korean Journal of Advertising and Public Relations,2013,2013,"The main purpose of this study is to examine the determinants of eWOM behavior of SNS users such as opinion seeking, opinion giving, and opinion passing. The predicting variables include nine factors which are categorized into 4 groups including personal characteristics(innovation, conformity), SNS traits(tie, strength, homophily, trust), interpersonal influence(normative influence, informative influence) and social capital(bridging social capital, bonding social capital) while dependant variable is eWOM behavior of SNS users composed of opinion seeking, opinion giving, and opinion passing. A survey of 400 SNS users was conducted to gather data needed to test research questions. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that 5 predictors out of 9 predictors including innovation, trust, normative influence, bridging social capital, and bonding social capital were statistically related to eWOM such as opinion seeking, opinion giving, and opinion passing. Among those, it turned out that bridging social capital was the best predictor of eWOM behaviors of SNS users, followed by normative influence, bonding social capital, innovation, and trust. The implication of this study is to strengthen these five factors such as bridging social capital, normative influence, bonding social capital, innovation, and trust to activate eWOM of SNS users.",
The Effects of Engagement with Entertainment,COMMUNICATION YEARBOOK 37,2013,2013,"A meta-analysis was employed to evaluate the state of research on the persuasion effects of involvement with entertainment media. The study investigates the effect of homophily, empathic identification, parasocial relationships, and transportation with entertainment media on attitudinal, behavioral and knowledge-related outcomes. The study identifies the specific conditions under which the effects vary. Results from the meta-analysis suggest that media involvement is moderately associated (r = .27) with persuasive outcomes. The content of the entertainment message (e.g., health, political), controlling for other study artifacts, significantly moderated the effect of involvement on outcomes. Directions for future research and theory development are suggested.",
On the Capability of Human Networks,2013 7TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (SYSCON 2013),2013,2013,"The aim of this paper is to propose an analytical model for predicting the collective capability of a group of individuals that are assigned to a job. This collective applied capability in future can be used as a predictor of performance or success of teams that have been given an assignment.In this context capability is defined as the application of a set of inherent and acquired resources and the level of their utilization to complete a job. These resources are classified into three categories Enablers, Preferences and past Attainments. The collective capability is therefore inferred from the interrelationship between the members with respect to their Diversity, Homophily, and their past Experiences/Attainments working in teams.By reviewing the relevant literature a basic definition for capability is provided. Also to introduce a method for measuring collective capability, the existing literature on analysis of social networks and methods of interpreting and modeling the dynamics of human networks are briefly discussed.Such a modeling tool enables managers and decision makers to measure and compare different group formations with respect to their capability and use this capability index as a predictor of future performance. Companies and project managers will be able to implement special team building policies and strategies to maximize their capabilities to ensure better outcomes.",
Sampling Node Pairs Over Large Graphs,2013 IEEE 29TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING (ICDE),2013,2013,"Characterizing user pair relationships is important for applications such as friend recommendation and interest targeting in online social networks (OSNs). Due to the large scale nature of such networks, it is infeasible to enumerate all user pairs and so sampling is used. In this paper, we show that it is a great challenge even for OSN service providers to characterize user pair relationships even when they possess the complete graph topology. The reason is that when sampling techniques (i.e., uniform vertex sampling (UVS) and random walk (RW)) are naively applied, they can introduce large biases, in particular, for estimating similarity distribution of user pairs with constraints such as existence of mutual neighbors, which is important for applications such as identifying network homophily. Estimating statistics of user pairs is more challenging in the absence of the complete topology information, since an unbiased sampling technique such as UVS is usually not allowed, and exploring the OSN graph topology is expensive. To address these challenges, we present asymptotically unbiased sampling methods to characterize user pair properties based on UVS and RW techniques respectively. We carry out an evaluation of our methods to show their accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we apply our methods to two Chinese OSNs, Doudan and Xiami, and discover significant homophily is present in these two networks.",
Inferring Cellular User Demographic Information Using Homophily on Call Graphs,2013 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOPS (INFOCOM WKSHPS),2013,2013,"Homophily refers to the phenomenon where people who are socially-connected share many characteristics including demographic and behavioral properties. The goal of this paper is to see whether homophily exists in call networks and if so, to what degree we can infer a cellphone user's demographic properties by knowing the demographic information of the people that s/he talks to. We focus on three types of demographic information: a) home location, b) age group, and c) income level. The novelty is two-folds. First, we use both communication metrics and structural properties of call graphs to identify those ""important"" friends for each user with whom (s)he is most likely to be in homophily. Second, we assess the importance of different time slices such as weekdays, or nights and weekends for capturing different user relationships. We conduct our study on a real data trace with 20M subscribers during one month from a nationwide cellular carrier. Our first contribution is that we quantify the extent of homophily on the call graph and identify the correlations between homophily and communication and structural features. As a second contribution, we develop effective methods to infer demographic information for a cellular user using linear regression to select the most homophily-like friend of her/him. We find that we can predict home location within 20km radius with 80% accuracy, and age group and income level with 78% and 72% accuracy, respectively.",

FAMILIARITY AND NOVELTY IN INTERPARTNER KNOWLEDGE Homophily Cycles in Joint Venture Networks,MANAGING KNOWLEDGE IN STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,2013,2013,"This study uses the theoretical lens of homophily to analyze the dynamics of interpartner knowledge similarity and dissimilarity. While a number of cross-disciplinary studies have investigated the dimensions and associated outcomes of homophily, researchers tend to treat homophily as invariant across time. We reexamine this implicit assumption in the context of alliance knowledge. Adopting an inductive orientation, we investigate changes in homophily levels in the joint venture network of the telecommunications industry during the period 1991-2000. The exploratory analysis suggests that interfirm homophily follows a cyclical pattern over time. To explain such homophily cycles, we propose a model in which the tension between two opposing forces-the search for familiar knowledge as well as for novel knowledge-determines observed homophily levels. Given that homophily minimizes the diversity of firm knowledge stocks, an understanding of homophily cycles will enrich the study of knowledge management in strategic alliances.",

We outline our methodology for selecting and evaluating such behaviors, and culminate with a study that evaluates our hypotheses of the possibility of ethnic attribution of a robot character through verbal and nonverbal behaviors and of achieving the homophily effect.",

Building entrepreneurial tie portfolios through strategic homophily: The role of narrative identity work in venture creation and early growth,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING,Jan 2013,2013,"In this article, we present the results of a case study of an entrepreneur who successfully founded and grew a venture underpinned by a portfolio of strongly homophilous, dyadic ties. Building on our case, we discuss how the entrepreneur strategically constructed these ties through a form of narrative identity work, explore the shared identity narratives that he used to do so, and highlight the heterogeneous nature of the resulting tie portfolio. We go on to explore the factors that motivated the entrepreneur to purposefully construct an entrepreneurial tie portfolio in this way. Building on our findings, we discuss the nature of narrative identity work and its role in creating homophilous ties, explore the connection between the resulting shared identity narratives and trust, and discuss the central role of values in strategic homophily.

Friendship: An old concept with a new meaning?,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jan 2013,2013,"Today many young people form and maintain what they consider friendships through the net. Internet friendship appears to some as modifying the meaning of real friendship and replacing it with something more trivial. In this paper we explore the complexity of online friendship. We start by seeking to gain an understanding of why and how friendship relates to wellbeing. We then look at how friendships are formed, focusing on the concepts of propinquity and homophily and how they play out within the context of online friendships. We delineate the major dimensions of friendship that have emerged in theory and research and then comment on how these features of friendship may be affected by the advent of widespread electronic communication. The differences between offline and online companionship, social support, tangible support and protection, exclusiveness, conflict resolution and relationship stability are also considered. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges of conducting research on the behaviour of children and young people on the Internet and the difficulties in defining the term ""friendship.""

"Cultural Diversity in Television Narratives: Homophilization, Appropriation, and Implications for Media Advocacy",JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING,2013,2013,"This research explores the role of cultural diversity in the construction of consumer identity, and in particular, how cultural diversity is appropriated through television viewing. Data based on depth interviews and surveys of young adults who created brand collages centered on a television-based character reveal that viewers identify and engage with television narratives through a process of ""homophilization""; that is, they actively envision various features of television narratives as similar to themselves and their own lived experiences. The data also show that homophilizing processes are enacted primarily by customizing the narrative, or textual poaching, in which the consumers insert themselves and their experiences into the narrative, and that consumption choices serve as primary mechanisms for poaching. Because media narratives are important in the formation and maintenance of consumer identity, the authors strongly recommend vigilance in the production and dissemination of socially conscious narratives that allow prosocial and realistic characters with whom consumers can actively engage.",
The Influence of Ethnic Diversity on Social Network Structure in a Common-Pool Resource System: Implications for Collaborative Management,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,2013,2013,"Social networks have recently been identified as key features in facilitating or constraining collaborative arrangements that can enhance resource governance and adaptability in complex social-ecological systems. Nonetheless, the effect of ethnicity on social network structure in an ethnically diverse common-pool resource system is virtually unknown. We characterize the entire social network of Hawaii's longline fishery, an ethnically diverse competitive pelagic fishery, and investigate network homophily, network structure, and cross-scale linkages. Results show that ethnicity significantly influences social network structure and is responsible for a homophily effect, which can create challenges for stakeholder collaboration across groups. Our analysis also suggests that ethnicity influences the formation of diverse network structures, and can affect the level of linkages to outside industry leaders, government or management officials, and members of the scientific community. This study provides the first empirical examination of the impact of ethnic diversity on resource user's social networks in the common-pool resource literature, having important implications for collaborative resource management.",
"Modelling ""Marriage Markets"": A Population-Scale Implementation and Parameter Test",JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Jan 2013,2013,"Choice mechanisms and social networks, including ""marriage markets"", seem well-suited to be modelled using agent-type simulations. Few real-world empirical examples are available in the public literature, particularly those using human populations of size. We reviewed partnership models in both the micro-simulation and agent-based literatures. We then empirically implemented an algorithm derived from two established models using inter-censal data on first partnerships in New Zealand over the period 1981-2006. The purpose of the exercise was to test the robustness of different parameter settings and to determine whether a model simulating partnership selection among eligible never-married young adults at one census period is feasible for predicting patterns of partnership, co-habitation and marriage at the next. Varying simulation time and social network size parameters of the model showed that patterns of ethnic partnering could be consistently produced and were not dependent on these model settings. Examining the different scoring methods showed that age similarity, education similarity, and previous partnering patterns could produce partnership patterns similar to those seen in the census. The simulation produced patterns of ethnic partnering similar to those seen in the census and seemed robust to different parameter settings. To further improve these results, an optimised combination of the scoring components is proposed. The simulations also provided preliminary evidence of ethnic preferences in the New Zealand marriage market.",
Exponential random graph models of preschool affiliative networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2013,2013,"Exponential random graph models were used to assess the relevance of reciprocity, popularity, transitivity controlling for effects based upon ego and alter sex, and sex homophily, on the formation of affiliative ties in 19 Portuguese preschool peer groups. The number of times two children were recorded as nearest neighbors in focal samples was used as an indicator of the relationship's strength. Independent parameter estimates of the different models (one for each group) were summarized, separately for the three age groups (""3-year-olds"", ""4-year-olds"" and ""5-year-olds"") using a multi-level approach to meta-analysis. Results showed that affiliative ties between children were sex segregated, highly reciprocal, more likely to be directed to a restricted number of children and with a tendency to create transitive triads. The structural processes underlying the formation of affiliative ties were quite stable between classrooms. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Ethnic variation in network composition in Urumchi: do state policies matter?,ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES,Jan 1 2013,2013,"This paper examines the inter-group difference in social leverage ties between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in Urumchi, China. Social leverage ties refer to high-status ties such as professionals and managers who can provide egos with information or access to education, training, employment, etc. Existing studies have suggested three hypotheses (i.e. retention of culture, homophily and neighbourhood poverty) for the mechanisms of ethnic differences in network composition. Based on the survey data the author collected in 2005, this paper suggests another main mechanism state policies in explaining the ethnic variations. State policies have led to in-group association and ethnic inequalities, which have limited Uyghur access to high-status individuals. Data analysis shows the UyghurHan difference in social leverage ties controlling for key background characteristics.",
Exploring Women Engineering Faculty's Mentoring Networks,2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE,2013,2013,"Research on mentoring has expanded from examination of traditional mentor-protege dyads to developmental mentoring networks. (20,37) In these network approaches, the emphasis is on a constellation of career developmental and personally supportive relationships to design career experiences for focal individuals and to respond to the issues that these focal individuals, or mentees, express. (1,15) To study engineering women faculty' career experiences, we examine their egocentric mentoring networks, (29) that is, the individuals' self-reported linkages between themselves (i.e., ""ego"" or hub of the network) and career developmental ""nodes""/mentors. We use a mixed methodological approach including multi-dimensional network analysis to map out the configurations of women faculty's mentoring network(11) and inductive analysis (6,7) to code our interview transcripts for mentoring relationships, women faculty's feelings about such relationships, and their perceived outcomes. Female engineering faculty members generally express dissatisfaction with the formal mentoring programs but endorse their informal and spontaneous/episodic mentorships emerging from their egocentric mentoring network. These women's mentoring networks are highly career-driven and consist of heterogeneous/diverse nodes, as well as multiplex ties that indicate multiple relationships between mentors and mentees. We provide theoretical and pragmatic implications of mentoring networks in the context of engineering faculty development.Mentoring is a dynamic process that is defined as ""a communication relationship in which a senior person supports, tutors, guides, and facilitates a junior person's career development"" (p. 15). (23) It is traditionally characterized by reciprocity or mutuality of social exchange, developmental benefits linked to the mentees' work and career, and consistent mentor-mentee interactions over some period of time (20) as opposed to a one-way short-term relationship. Research on mentoring has expanded from examination of traditional mentor-protege dyads to diverse situationally-based developmental mentoring networks. (20,37) In these more recent network approaches, the emphasis is on a constellation of career developmental and personally supportive relationships to design career experiences for individuals and to respond to the issues that these individuals, or mentees, express. (1,15)Developmental networks are valuable for achieving a variety of career outcomes ranging from promotion and career advancement (39) as well as clarity of professional identity, (16) to more variability of advice than a primary or sole mentor can achieve. (22) In addition, developmental networks are found to be gendered and racialized in the sense that women and individuals of color more often experience challenges in gaining access to and maintaining reliable and meaningful mentoring networks. Current research mainly focuses on mentoring in corporate settings. In academe, there is a growing body of research on undergraduate mentoring. However, few studies explore faculty mentoring processes in academic settings and none describe how faculty mentoring networks are enacted in ways that advantage and disadvantage particular group members such as women in engineering. (44)Our research expands the current literature by studying not only women faculty members' mentoring relationships but also women engineers' developmental mentoring network configurations. Furthermore, we explore an underresearched mentoring process known as episodic or spontaneous mentoring and mentoring moments. (1) As such, we contribute to much-needed empirical research on women in STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math) that can help identify reasons for and strategies to combat women's unequal participation in these occupations and careers. We do so through theoretical and methodological lenses unused previously in academic engineering contexts. Specifically, we examine women's egocentric mentoring networks derived from qualitative interview data. Egocentric mentoring networks consist of individuals' self-reported linkages between themselves (i.e., ""ego"" or hub of the network) and their career developmental ""nodes"". (29) These network nodes can be resources, technology, and people that serve particular roles connected with departments, associations, institutions, agencies, and other organizations. (11) Guided by multiple network theories such as homophily, embeddedness, and social capital, our goal is twofold: to understand how women engineering faculty construct their mentoring networks; and to display and analyze women engineering faculty's mentoring network configurations. To provide further context for these aims, we next supply an overview of mentoring research and social network constructs and theories that concludes with our two research questions. We follow this literature review with a detailed description of our research methods. We then present the findings based on the content and attributes of nodes as well as ties within the ego-centric mentoring networks. We conclude our paper by discussing our theoretical contributions and our findings' pragmatic applications to women engineering faculty's career development.",
Assessing group cohesion in homophily networks,2013 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM),2013,2013,"The analysis and exploration of a social network depends on the type of relations at play. Borgatti had proposed a type taxonomy organizing relations in four possible categories. Homophily (similarity) relationships form an important category where relations occur when entities of the network link whenever they exhibit similar behaviors. Examples are networks of co-author, where homophily between two persons follows from co-authorship; or network of actors having played under the supervision of the same movie director, for instance. Homophily is often embodied through a bipartite network where entities of a given type A (authors, movie directors) connect through entities of a different type B (papers, actors). A common strategy is then to project this bipartite graph onto a single-type network with entities of a same type A, possibly weighting edges based on how the type A entities interact with the type B entities underlying the edge. The resulting single-type network can then be studied using standard techniques such as community detection using edge density, or the computation of various centrality indices. This paper revisits this type of approach and introduces a homogeneity measure inspired form past work by Burt. Two entities of type B interact when they both induce a same edge between two entities of type A. The homogeneity of a subgroup thus depends on how intensely and how equally interactions occur between entities of type B giving rise to the subgroup. The measure thus differentiates between subgroups of type A exhibiting similar topologies depending on the interaction patterns of the underlying entities of type B. The method is validated using two widely used datasets. A first example looks at authors of the IEEE InfoVis Conference (InfoVis 2007 Contest). A second example looks at homophily relations between movie actors that have played under the direction of a same director (IMDB).",
Temporal influence over the Last.fm social network,2013 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM),2013,2013,"Several recent results show the influence of social contacts to spread certain properties over the network, but others question the methodology of these experiments by proposing that the measured effects may be due to homophily or a shared environment. In this paper we justify the existence of the social influence by considering the temporal behavior of Last.fm users. In order to clearly distinguish between friends sharing the same interest, especially since Last.fm recommends friends based on similarity of taste, we separated the timeless effect of similar taste from the temporal impulses of immediately listening to the same artist after a friend. We measured strong increase of listening to a completely new artist in a few hours period after a friend compared to non-friends representing a simple trend or external influence. In our experiment to eliminate network independent elements of taste, we improved collaborative filtering and trend based methods by blending with simple time aware recommendations based on the influence of friends. Our experiments are carried over the two-year ""scrobble"" history of 70,000 Last.fm users.",
Simmelian Backbones: Amplifying Hidden Homophily in Facebook Networks,2013 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM),2013,2013,"Empirical social networks are often aggregate proxies for several heterogeneous relations. In online social networks, for instance, interactions related to friendship, kinship, business, interests, and other relationships may all be represented as catchall ""friendships."" Because several relations are mingled into one, the resulting networks exhibit relatively high and uniform density. As a consequence, the variation in positional differences and local cohesion may be too small for reliable analysis.We introduce a method to identify the essential relationships in networks representing social interactions. Our method is based on a novel concept of triadic cohesion that is motivated by Simmel's concept of membership in social groups. We demonstrate that our Simmelian backbones are capable of extracting structure from Facebook interaction networks that makes them easy to visualize and analyze. Since all computations are local, the method can be restricted to partial networks such as ego networks, and scales to big data.",
Egocentric Network Analysis to Score the Telecom Customers,2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING RESEARCH (ICCIC),2013,2013,"Social Network Analysis is an important tool to understand and predict the behavioral patterns of the telecom customers. Sciocentric (whole) network analysis processes massive amount of network data, which may include millions of customers and relationships between them. However building the egocentric network for each customer effectively reduces the processing cost and gives the detail visualization of the connection pattern of the telecom customers. This paper addresses the logic behind the egocentric network analysis by taking into account the level of influence of individuals whom they are connected within a network. We also discusses the features of those customers who adapted to certain services within a network and the likelihood of the others adapting to similar services from the same network is predictable. Hence the ROI on marketing towards consumers who belongs to same network increases significantly.",
Science Networks in Cutting-edge Research Institutions: Gender Homophily and Embeddedness in Formal and Informal Networks,9TH CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (ASNA),2013,2013,"Female researchers are underrepresented in leading academic positions. Literature has referred to networks as a central factor for sex differences in scientific careers. The present study analyses the interrelations between formal and informal science networks and focuses on gender homophily as a driver for structural embeddedness. Applying QAP network correlation analysis on the principal investigators of two institutions from the German Excellence Initiative, gender homophily minorly influences the involvement in research cooperation, research support and social acquaintance networks. Other similarity variables seem to be more strongly related to integration in science networks, namely, research area, geographic dispersal and academic status. (C) 2013 The Authors.

SELECTION AND INFLUENCE IN THE ASSIMILATION PROCESS OF IMMIGRANTS,ADVANCES IN GROUP PROCESSES: THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY EDITION,2013,2013,"Purpose - Empirical studies show substantial variation across immigrants in the rate and direction of assimilation along various dimensions (e.g., cross-ethnic contact, language, identity). To explain this variation, past research has focused on identifying exogenous factors, such as discrimination, human capital, and settlement intention. In this chapter we argue that variation in immigrant outcomes emerges endogenously through positive interaction effects between dimensions of assimilation. We propose a new assimilation model in which processes of social influence and selection into congruent social environments give rise to multiple long-term equilibria. In this model, migrants who are already assimilated along many dimensions tend to also adapt along other dimensions, while less assimilated migrants become more strongly embedded in their ethnic group.Design/methodology/approach - To test the assimilation model, we derive a number of hypotheses, which we evaluate using trend analysis and dynamic panel regression on data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada.Findings - The data mostly confirm the hypotheses, providing overall support for the assimilation model.Research implications - Our theory and findings suggest that immigrants would follow divergent assimilation trajectories even in the absence of a priori population heterogeneity in external factors.Social implications - The positive interaction effects between cultural and structural dimensions of assimilation suggest that mixed policies that promote integration while seeking to prevent loss of identity go against the natural tendency for cultural and structural assimilation to go hand in hand.Originality/value - The present chapter proposes a novel model of immigrant assimilation and an empirical test.",
Investigating Influential Factors Influencing Users to Share News in Social Media: A Diffusion of Innovations Perspective,JCDL'13: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH ACM/IEEE-CS JOINT CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL LIBRARIES,2013,2013,"This study aims to investigate the factors influencing news sharing in social media. Drawing from the diffusion of innovations theory (DOI), the influential factors identified are opinion leadership, homophily, tie strength, and news attributes. By incorporating social network analysis with multiple regression analysis, our results indicate that opinion leadership was the strongest factor predicting users' news sharing, followed by news attribute and tie strength. Unexpectedly, we also found that homophily hampered news sharing in social media. Implications are discussed",
Communication and Social Capital －The Relationship between North Korean Refugees' SNS use and Bonding and Bridging Social Capital－,Journalism & Communication,2013,2013,"This study aimed to understand the adoption and usage of Noth-Korean refugees with respect to social networking services (SNSs) and their effects on the generation of social capital. Differeing from the extant research that had tried to explain the generative mechaism of social capital based on organizational membership or the amount of media use, we intended to identity the independent effects of communication-related variables on social capital. For that purpose, we employed communication openness, conversational appropriateness, and homophily as communication-related variables, communicative competence and individual involvement as individual traits, and lastly the usage period of Internet, the usage period of SNSs, and daily usage of SNSs as technology-usage variables. For testing the suggested hypotheses in the study, we segmented social capital into bonding and bridging social captial, based on a principal component analysis. From regression analyses, we found that bonding social capitial was only related to comunication openness and converational appropriateness. However, bridging social capital was related to the usage period of Internet, communicative competence and all of the communication-related variables. Additional hierarchical regression analyses also confirmed that communication-related variables had independent effects on both bonding and bridging social capital.",
,Korean Journal of Broadcasting & Telecommunications Research,2013,2013,"In general, people tends to view other people’s personalities based on their own behaviors and words which they use in face-to-face communication of everyday lives. In a computer-mediated communication, SNS users obtain information from texts that other users have written in SNS. The texts in SNS contains a key feature that characterizes user identify in online social networks. In this study, we examine the relation between personality and the users' structural position in SNS. We hypothesize that a personality revealed on text can have effects on a structural position of users based on proximity in a network, which we define as homophily. The result shows that a personality is a significant predictor in behaviors, attitudes and position in online networks. The finding indicates that the distances between people who have similar personalities are closer than those who have different personalities. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

Social networks of Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) in bottomland hardwood forests,JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,Dec 2012,2012,"Understanding social relationships and organization in colonial bat species can provide valuable insight into species ecology and potentially aid in conservation efforts of rare bat species. We applied social network analysis to describe social relationships and organization in 3 colonies of Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) roosting in bottomland hardwood forests in Kentucky. We radiotracked 48 adult big-eared bats to 64 day-roosts over 549 bat-days during the summers of 2009-2011. We measured homophily, network centralization, density, transitivity, and core-periphery structure of networks of bats sharing common roosts, and we measured degree centrality of nodes (bats or roosts) within networks. Patterns of ties within each colony were homophilous by sex (E-I index = -0.87). Males were consistently the least central nodes in bat networks. Bat network centralization ranged from 1.2% to 40% among colonies, and roost network centralization ranged from 17% to 40%. The colony exhibiting the least centralized and most dense bat network also occupied habitat with low roost availability. This roost network was highly centralized, with bats frequently aggregating at a single roost. The colony with the most centralized and least dense bat network occupied habitat with a greater availability of roosts, resulting in diffuse networks of bats and roosts. Transitivity decreased after young became volant in the colony with highest roost availability. Our findings suggest that social structure in colonies of Rafinesque's big-eared bats is affected by the sex of individuals in colonies, reproductive season, and the preponderance of available day-roosting habitat.",
Birds of an ethnic feather? Ethnic identity homophily among college-age friends,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE,Dec 2012,2012,"This study assessed the degree to which pairs of friends report similar levels of ethnic identity. College-age friends (n = 107 pairs; N = 214 overall) completed measures of ethnic identity exploration and commitment, identity synthesis, relationship closeness, and frequency of talking to friends and family about ethnicity-related issues. Participants were ethnically-diverse and constituted three types of dyads: both ethnic minorities (n = 51), both White (n = 24), or mixed ethnic minority and White (n = 32). Overall, friends reported similar levels of ethnic identity exploration and commitment. The ethnic composition of the pair moderated similarity, with ethnic minority pairs showing greater similarity than the White and mixed pairs. Frequency of ethnicity-related discussions with friends and family, but not relationship closeness, mediated the observed similarity for ethnic minority pairs. These findings suggest a level of ethnic identity homophily between ethnic minority friends that can be explained by interactional mechanisms.

Prejudicial behavior: More closely linked to homophilic peer preferences than to trait bigotry,BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES,Dec 2012,2012,"We disagree with Dixon et al. by maintaining that prejudice is primarily rooted in aversive reactions toward out-group members. However, these reactions are not indicative of negative attributes, such as trait bigotry, but rather normative homophily for peers with similar perceived attributes. Cognitive biases such as stereotype threat perpetuate perceptions of inequipotential and subsequent discrimination, irrespective of individuals' personality characteristics.",
Hiring as Cultural Matching: The Case of Elite Professional Service Firms,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Dec 2012,2012,"This article presents culture as a vehicle of labor market sorting. Providing a case study of hiring in elite professional service firms, I investigate the often suggested but heretofore empirically unexamined hypothesis that cultural similarities between employers and job candidates matter for employers' hiring decisions. Drawing from 120 interviews with employers as well as participant observation of a hiring committee, I argue that hiring is more than just a process of skills sorting; it is also a process of cultural matching between candidates, evaluators, and firms. Employers sought candidates who were not only competent but also culturally similar to themselves in terms of leisure pursuits, experiences, and self-presentation styles. Concerns about shared culture were highly salient to employers and often outweighed concerns about absolute productivity. I unpack the interpersonal processes through which cultural similarities affected candidate evaluation in elite firms and provide the first empirical demonstration that shared culture-particularly in the form of lifestyle markers-matters for employer hiring. I conclude by discussing the implications for scholarship on culture, inequality, and labor markets.",
A SOCIAL NETWORK-BASED INFERENCE MODEL FOR VALIDATING CUSTOMER PROFILE DATA,MIS QUARTERLY,Dec 2012,2012,"Drawing from the social and relational perspectives, this study offers an innovative conceptualization and operational approach regarding the validation of self:reported customer demographic data, which has become an essential corporate asset for harnessing business intelligence. Specifically, based on social network and homophily paradigms in which individuals have a natural tendency to associate and interact frequently with others with similar characteristics, we constructed a relational inference model to determine the accuracy of self-administered consumer profiles. In addition, to flirt her enhance the reliability of our model's prediction capability, we employed the entropy mechanism that minimizes potential biases that may arise from a simple probabilistic approach. To empirically validate the accuracy of our inference framework, we obtained and analyzed over 20 million actual call transactions supplied by one of the largest global telecommunication service providers. The results suggest that our social network-based inference model consistently outperforms other competing mechanisms (e.g., weighted average and simple relational classifier) regardless of the criteria choice (e.g., number of call receivers, call duration, and call frequency), with an accuracy rate of approximately 93 percent. Finally, to confirm the generalizability of our findings, we conducted simulation experiments to validate the robustness of the results in response to variations in parameter values and increases in potential noise in the data. We discuss several implications related to business intelligence for both research and practice, and offer new directions for future studies.",
Indiscriminate discrimination: A correspondence test for ethnic homophily in the Chicago labor market,LABOUR ECONOMICS,Dec 2012,2012,"Numerous field experiments have demonstrated the existence of discrimination in labor markets against specific minority groups. This paper uses a correspondence test to determine whether this discrimination is due to prejudice against specific groups, or a general preference for the majority group. Three groups of identical fabricated resumes are sent to help-wanted advertisements in Chicago newspapers: one with Anglo-Saxon names, one with African-American names, and one with fictitious foreign names whose ethnic origin is unidentifiable to most Americans. Resumes with Anglo-Saxon names generate nearly one third more call-backs than identical resumes with non Anglo-Saxon ones, either African-American or Foreign. We take this as evidence that discriminatory behavior is part of a larger pattern of unequal treatment of any member of non-majority groups, ethnic homophily. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Polarized Networks: The Organizational Affiliations of National Party Convention Delegates,AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST,Dec 2012,2012,"Previous research has documented that the institutional behaviors (e.g., lobbying, campaign contributions) of political organizations reflect the polarization of these organizations along party lines. However, little is known about how these groups are connected at the level of individual party activists. Using data from a survey of 738 delegates at the 2008 Democratic and Republican national conventions, we use network regression analysis to demonstrate that co-membership networks of national party convention delegates are highly polarized by party, even after controlling for homophily due to ideology, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, age, educational attainment, income, and religious participation. Among delegates belonging to the same organization, only 1.78% of these co-memberships between delegates crossed party lines, and only 2.74% of the ties between organizations sharing common delegates were bipartisan in nature. We argue that segregation of organizational ties on the basis of party adds to the difficulty of finding common political ground between the parties.",
"Identifying Gender-Preferred Communication Styles within Online Cancer Communities: A Retrospective, Longitudinal Analysis",PLOS ONE,Nov 14 2012,2012,"Background: The goal of this research is to determine if different gender-preferred social styles can be observed within the user interactions at an online cancer community. To achieve this goal, we identify and measure variables that pertain to each gender-specific social style.Methods and Findings: We perform social network and statistical analysis on the communication flow of 8,388 members at six different cancer forums over eight years. Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to measure the difference between the number of intimate (and highly intimate) dyads, relationship length, and number of communications. We determine that two patients are more likely to form an intimate bond on a gender-specific cancer forum (ovarian P = <0.0001, breast P = 0.0089, prostate P = 0.0021). Two female patients are more likely to form a highly intimate bond on a female-specific cancer forum (Ovarian P < 0.0001, Breast P < 0.01). Typically a male patient communicates with more members than a female patient (Ovarian forum P = 0.0406, Breast forum P = 0.0013). A relationship between two patients is longer on the gender-specific cancer forums than a connection between two members not identified as patients (ovarian forum P = 0.00406, breast forum P = 0.00013, prostate forum P = .0.0003).Conclusion: : The high level of interconnectedness among the prostate patients supports the hypothesis that men prefer to socialize in large, interconnected, less-intimate groups. A female patient is more likely to form a highly intimate connection with another female patient; this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that woman prefer fewer, more intimate connections. The relationships of same-gender cancer patients last longer than other relationships; this finding demonstrates homophily within these online communities. Our findings regarding online communication preferences are in agreement with research findings from person-to-person communication preference studies. These findings should be considered when designing online communities as well as designing and evaluating psychosocial and educational interventions for cancer patients.",
The Evolution of Homophily,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Nov 13 2012,2012,"Biologists have devoted much attention to assortative mating or homogamy, the tendency for sexual species tomate with similar others. In contrast, there has been little theoretical work on the broader phenomenon of homophily, the tendency for individuals to interact with similar others. Yet this behaviour is also widely observed in nature. Here, we model how natural selection can give rise to homophily when individuals engage in social interaction in a population with multiple observable phenotypes. Payoffs to interactions depend on whether or not individuals have the same or different phenotypes, and each individual has a preference that determines how likely they are to interact with others of their own phenotype (homophily) or of opposite phenotypes (heterophily). The results show that homophily tends to evolve under a wide variety of conditions, helping to explain its ubiquity in nature.",
The Visible Hand? Demand Effects of Recommendation Networks in Electronic Markets,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Nov 2012,2012,"Online commercial interactions have increased dramatically over the last decade, leading to the emergence of networks that link the electronic commerce landing pages of related products to one another. Our paper conjectures that the explicit visibility of such ""product networks"" can alter demand spillovers across their constituent items. We test this conjecture empirically using data about the copurchase networks and demand levels associated with more than 250,000 interconnected books offered on Amazon.com over the period of one year while controlling for alternative explanations of demand correlation using a variety of approaches. Our findings suggest that on average the explicit visibility of a copurchase relationship can lead to up to an average threefold amplification of the influence that complementary products have on each others' demand levels. We also find that newer and more popular products ""use"" the attention they garner from their network position more efficiently and that diversity in the sources of spillover further amplifies the demand effects of the recommendation network. Our paper presents new evidence quantifying the role of network position in electronic markets and highlights the power of basing (virtual) shelf position on consumer preferences that are explicitly revealed through shared purchasing patterns.",
Consensus in the two-state Axelrod model,STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS,Nov 2012,2012,"The Axelrod model is a spatial stochastic model for the dynamics of cultures which, similar to the voter model, includes social influence, but differs from the latter by also accounting for another social factor called homophily, the tendency to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar. Each individual is characterized by its opinions about a finite number of cultural features, each of which can assume the same finite number of states. Pairs of adjacent individuals interact at a rate equal to the fraction of features they have in common, thus modeling homophily, which results in the interacting pair having one more cultural feature in common, thus modeling social influence. It has been conjectured based on numerical simulations that the one-dimensional Axelrod model clusters when the number of features exceeds the number of states per feature. In this article, we prove this conjecture for the two-state model with an arbitrary number of features. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Including spatial interdependence in customer acquisition models: A cross-category comparison,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Nov 1 2012,2012,"Within analytical customer relationship management (CRM), customer acquisition models suffer the most from a lack of data quality because the information of potential customers is mostly limited to socio-demographic and lifestyle variables obtained from external data vendors. Particularly in this situation, taking advantage of the spatial correlation between customers can improve the predictive performance of these models. This study compares an autoregressive and hierarchical technique that both are able to incorporate spatial information in a model that can be applied on large datasets, which is typical for CRM. Predictive performances of these models are compared in an application that identifies potential new customers for 25 products and brands. The results show that when a discrete spatial variable is used to group customers into mutually exclusive neighborhoods, a multilevel model performs at least as well as, and for a large number of durable goods even significantly better than a frequently used autologistic model. Further, this application provides interesting insights for marketing decision makers. It indicates that especially for publicly consumed durable goods neighborhood effects can be identified. However, for more exclusive brands, incorporating spatial information will not always result in major predictive improvements. For these luxury products, the high spatial interdependence is mainly caused by homophily in which the spatial variable is a substitute for absent socio-demographic and lifestyle variables. As a result, these neighborhood variables lose a lot of predictive value on top of a traditional acquisition model that typically is based on such non-transactional variables. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

How social and genetic factors predict friendship networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Oct 23 2012,2012,"Recent research suggests that the genotype of one individual in a friendship pair is predictive of the genotype of his/her friend. These results provide tentative support for the genetic homophily perspective, which has important implications for social and genetic epidemiology because it substantiates a particular form of gene-environment correlation. This process may also have important implications for social scientists who study the social factors related to health and health-related behaviors. We extend this work by considering the ways in which school context shapes genetically similar friendships. Using the network, school, and genetic information from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we show that genetic homophily for the TaqI A polymorphism within the DRD2 gene is stronger in schools with greater levels of inequality. Our results suggest that individuals with similar genotypes may not actively select into friendships; rather, they may be placed into these contexts by institutional mechanisms outside of their control. Our work highlights the fundamental role played by broad social structures in the extent to which genetic factors explain complex behaviors, such as friendships.",
Recruitment of at-risk population through network based sampling: experiences from Maharashtra IBBA Round-I survey,INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH,Oct 2012,2012,"Background & objectives: Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) method is increasingly being used for surveys among hard to reach populations. It essentially relies on the networking among the target population. Key behavioural indicators, HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence were measured under Integrated Behavioural and Biological Assessment (IBBA), designed to study the impact of Avahan India AIDS Initiative. RDS surveys were conducted in 2006 and 2007 among high risk populations.Methods: Four separate surveys covered female sex workers (FSW) (Mumbai, Parabhani), Bar Girl (Mumbai) and injecting drug users (MU) (Mumbai-Thane) population through RDS. Respondents were recruited through the personal and social networks of the initially selected ""seeds"". Successive recruitments were done through snowball effect. Duel compensation for participation and recruitment was given. Three uniquely numbered coupons were given to recruit peers from network. Through subsequent waves of recruitment desirable sample was achieved. Informed and voluntary consent was obtained.Results: A total. of 338 bar girls, 403 FSWs (Mumbai), 367 FSW (Parbhani) and 376 IDUs (Mumbai/Thane) were recruited through RDS. The desired samples were achieved within three months period. Average seeds recruited for each survey ranged from 22 to 35. Average reported network size ranged from 4.8 to 13.2. Homophily index for each survey group was found to be 0.0 except for bar girl survey (0.3). Some seeds yielded multiple waves of recruitment while many failed to go beyond first wave.Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings suggest that RDS does not appear to recruit more marginalized or undercovered section of the targeted group. Greater preparatory activity and better understanding of networks may be required for setting up appropriate venues across geographical boundaries. Further in-depth network analysis is needed in diverse regional structures and population coverage in conducting RDS surveys locally.",
Birds of a feather get lost together: new venture team composition and performance,SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS,Oct 2012,2012,"This study explores the relationship between new venture team composition and new venture persistence and performance over time. We examine the team characteristics of a 5-year panel study of 202 new venture teams and new venture performance. Our study makes two contributions. First, we extend earlier research concerning homophily theories of the prevalence of homogeneous teams. Using structural event analysis we demonstrate that team members' start-up experience is important in this context. Second, we attempt to reconcile conflicting evidence concerning the influence of team homogeneity on performance by considering the element of time. We hypothesize that higher team homogeneity is positively related to short term outcomes, but is less effective in the longer term. Our results confirm a difference over time. We find that more homogeneous teams are less likely to be higher performing in the long term. However, we find no relationship between team homogeneity and short-term performance outcomes.",
Homophily and Health Behavior in Social Networks of Older Adults,FAMILY & COMMUNITY HEALTH,OCT-DEC 2012,2012,"A common network phenomenon, homophily, involves developing relationships with others who are similar to you. The intent of this study was to determine if older adults' health behaviors were shared within social networks. We interviewed older adults from low-income senior housing (egos) on egocentric social network characteristics and key health behaviors for themselves and for named social ties (alters). Findings suggest strong effects for homophily, especially for those who smoked and were physically inactive. Public health interventions for older adults should consider the influence that social relationships have on personal health behaviors. Network-based interventions may be required.",
"What the eye does not see, the mind cannot reject: Can call center location explain differences in customer evaluations?",INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW,Oct 2012,2012,"Moving call centers offshore may be an effective way to increase service productivity by lowering costs, yet recent research suggests that customers associate offshore call centers with lower service quality. This study clarifies customer evaluations of call centers with a field study that examines how customer perceptions of a foreign accent, call center location, and the agent's customer orientation relate to nonmonetary performance outcomes. Multivariate analysis of data collected from more than 800 customers using call centers located in three countries suggests that neither accent detection nor call center location relates to customer satisfaction, trust, or word-of-mouth communication; only perceived customer orientation has an effect on these outcomes. These findings suggest offshore call center locations are not necessarily associated with lower performance outcomes and that service firms should place a higher priority on ensuring call center agents have a strong customer orientation, rather than on avoiding the use of call centers abroad.

Targeting college students on Facebook? How to stop wasting your money,BUSINESS HORIZONS,SEP-OCT 2012,2012,"While Facebook usage has seen explosive growth, scant research has explored returns on advertising dollars marketers invest in this emerging medium. Our two-stage study of 18- to 25-year-old college students suggests that many of the advertising dollars consumer goods firms spend on Facebook are likely wasted. This study highlights that, in addition to staying in touch with friends and relatives, Facebook users are primarily motivated by three desires: (1) to voyeuristically peer into others' lives, (2) to create a distinctive identity for themselves, and (3) to act on their inner narcissistic tendencies. These motivations also make them poor prospects for advertisers, as users seem disinterested in Facebook ads and disengaged from marketers' attempts to build brands. Herein, we discuss challenges for marketers, as well as opportunities for building brands and driving sales via Facebook. (C) 2012 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Glass ceiling or golden cage: Is discrimination in the workplace or duties in the family preventing women from promotion to early management positions?,KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE,Sep 2012,2012,"Using data from the HIS-Graduate Panel 1997, this analysis scrutinizes competing explanations for the gender gap in attainment of first management positions. Homophily, allocative and statistical discrimination as causal mechanisms which studies with a focus on organizations emphasize, in this analysis exert no explanatory power for gender inequality. Two non-organizational factors here fully account for the gender gap. Besides women's and men's self-selection into different fields of study, the gender-specific consequences of family formation explain the major part of the gap. Our findings show that motherhood nearly reduces the probability by half for a woman to hold a management position ten years after graduation from university. We argue that family policy and the availability of child care services moderate the size of the mother gap. In line with this reasoning, our results show that the mother gap in early management positions is smaller in East-German states than in West-German states.",
Homophily and long-run integration in social networks,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY,Sep 2012,2012,"We model network formation when heterogeneous nodes enter sequentially and form connections through both random meetings and network-based search, but with type-dependent biases. We show that there is ""long-run integration"", whereby the composition of types in sufficiently old nodes' neighborhoods approaches the global type-distribution, provided that the network-based search is unbiased. However, younger nodes' connections still reflect the biased meetings process. We derive the type-based degree distributions and group-level homophily patterns when there are two types and location-based biases. Finally, we illustrate aspects of the model with an empirical application to data on citations in physics journals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Who teaches and who learns? Policy learning through the C40 cities climate network,POLICY SCIENCES,Sep 2012,2012,"This study examines the network structure of policy learning in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which is a network of the world's largest cities committed to tackling climate change issues. Among forty members and nineteen affiliate members, we ask the question with whom do cities learn and why? How are policy-learning relationships associated with cities' multi-stakeholder governing body, policy performance, and cultural similarities? While studies on learning have analyzed conditions facilitating learning, quantitative studies of local government learning in global networks are rare. To facilitate the investigation into learning, we conceptualize learning as a process comprising information seeking, adoption and policy change, and focus on information seeking as the foundation step in the learning process. This social network analysis using the exponential random graph model reveals the cities that seek information and those that are information sources are different subgroups. Furthermore, analysis of nodal attributes suggests that transmunicipal learning in the C40 network is facilitated by the presence of a multi-stakeholder governing body; homophily of culture (language and regional proximity); and higher level of climate change policy performance. Creating a multi-stakeholder governing body could ensure participatory representativeness from citizens and relevant stakeholders to enhance climate change policy engagement and decision making as well as policy learning.",
"The 'friendship dynamics of religion,' or the 'religious dynamics of friendship'? A social network analysis of adolescents who attend small schools",SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Sep 2012,2012,"Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1) social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed.

Social distance and homophily in adolescent smoking initiation,DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE,Aug 1 2012,2012,"Background: Studies often demonstrate homophily in adolescent smoking behavior, but rarely investigate the extent to which this is due to the peer network processes of selection versus influence. Applying the concept of social distance, this study examines these two processes for smoking initiation.Methods: We analyzed socio-centric network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=2065; grades = 7th-12th). Social distance (degrees of separation), combined with stability and change in friendship networks, was used to derive indicators of peer selection and influence on initiation. Multilevel modeling was used to predict initiation from these indicators, and propensity score modeling was used to determine whether these associations remained after adjusting for pre-existing differences between initiators and consistent non-smokers.Results: We found that both peer influence and selection effects increased the likelihood of initiation even after adjusting with propensity score weights and demographic controls. While the effect size for peer influence depended on the overall proportion of smokers at the school, the selection effect was independent of the school environment. De-selection and indirect influence effects were not significant after controlling for school norm interactions.Conclusions: The association between peer smoking and adolescent smoking initiation appears to be due to both peer selection and direct influence. However, ""friends of friends"" effects are likely to be confounded with contextual factors. Given that smoking initiation is primarily associated with close personal interactions between the adolescent and his/her friends, prevention efforts should focus on the role of smoking in fostering personal relationships among adolescents.

How Homophily Affects the Speed of Learning and Best-Response Dynamics,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,Aug 2012,2012,"We examine how the speed of learning and best-response processes depends on homophily: the tendency of agents to associate disproportionately with those having similar traits. When agents' beliefs or behaviors are developed by averaging what they see among their neighbors, then convergence to a consensus is slowed by the presence of homophily but is not influenced by network density (in contrast to other network processes that depend on shortest paths). In deriving these results, we propose a new, general measure of homophily based on the relative frequencies of interactions among different groups. An application to communication in a society before a vote shows how the time it takes for the vote to correctly aggregate information depends on the homophily and the initial information distribution.

"Group differences in reciprocity, multiplexity and exchange: measures and application",QUALITY & QUANTITY,Aug 2012,2012,"Local forces structure social networks. One major and widely researched local force is reciprocity, often assumed to work homogeneously across actors-i.e., all actors are equally subject to the same level of force towards reciprocity. Other local forces, like multiplexity and exchange, are also often assumed to apply equally to different actors. But social theory provides us with ample arguments why such forces might be stronger in some subsets of actors than others, or why such forces might affect intergroup ties more than intragroup ties. In this paper we introduce standard measures to capture these group specific forces towards reciprocity, multiplexity, and exchange. All the measures control for differential tendencies of actors to initiate ties of various types. We also introduce a procedure by which differences in the strength of these forces between groups and subgroups can be statistically evaluated.",
"Networking between community health programs: a case study outlining the effectiveness, barriers and enablers",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,Jul 19 2012,2012,"Background: In India, since the 1990s, there has been a burgeoning of NGOs involved in providing primary health care. This has resulted in a complex NGO-Government interface which is difficult for lone NGOs to navigate. The Uttarakhand Cluster, India, links such small community health programs together to build NGO capacity, increase visibility and better link to the government schemes and the formal healthcare system. This research, undertaken between 1998 and 2011, aims to examine barriers and facilitators to such linking, or clustering, and the effectiveness of this clustering approach.Methods: Interviews, indicator surveys and participant observation were used to document the process and explore the enablers, the barriers and the effectiveness of networks improving community health.Results: The analysis revealed that when activating, framing, mobilising and synthesizing the Uttarakhand Cluster, key brokers and network players were important in bridging between organisations. The ties (or relationships) that held the cluster together included homophily around common faith, common friendships and geographical location and common mission. Self interest whereby members sought funds, visibility, credibility, increased capacity and access to trainings was also a commonly identified motivating factor for networking. Barriers to network synthesizing included lack of funding, poor communication, limited time and lack of human resources. Risk aversion and mistrust remained significant barriers to overcome for such a network.Conclusions: In conclusion, specific enabling factors allowed the clustering approach to be effective at increasing access to resources, creating collaborative opportunities and increasing visibility, credibility and confidence of the cluster members. These findings add to knowledge regarding social network formation and collaboration, and such knowledge will assist in the conceptualisation, formation and success of potential health networks in India and other developing world countries.",
Social networks reveal cultural behaviour in tool-using using dolphins,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Jul 2012,2012,"Animal tool use is of inherent interest given its relationship to intelligence, innovation and cultural behaviour. Here we investigate whether Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins that use marine sponges as hunting tools (spongers) are culturally distinct from other dolphins in the population based on the criteria that sponging is both socially learned and distinguishes between groups. We use social network analysis to determine social preferences among 36 spongers and 69 non-spongers sampled over a 22-year period while controlling for location, sex and matrilineal relatedness. Homophily (the tendency to associate with similar others) based on tool-using status was evident in every analysis, although maternal kinship, sex and location also contributed to social preference. Female spongers were more cliquish and preferentially associated with other spongers over non-spongers. Like humans who preferentially associate with others who share their subculture, tool-using dolphins prefer others like themselves, strongly suggesting that sponge tool-use is a cultural behaviour.",
Social Sharing of Information Goods: Implications for Pricing and Profits,MARKETING SCIENCE,JUL-AUG 2012,2012,"Social sharing of information goods-wherein a single good is purchased and shared through a network of acquaintances such as friends or coworkers-is a significant concern for the providers of these goods. The effect of social sharing on firm pricing and profits depends critically on two elements: the structure of the underlying consumer network and the mechanism used by groups to decide whether to purchase at a given price. We examine the effect of social sharing under different network structures (decentralized, centralized, and complete), which reflect a range of market conditions. Moreover, we draw from the mechanism design literature to examine several approaches to group decision making. Our results suggest that a firm can benefit from increased social sharing if the level of sharing is already high, enabling a pricing strategy targeted primarily at sharing groups rather than individuals. However, the point at which sharing becomes marginally beneficial for a firm depends on both the distribution of group sizes (which derives from the network structure) and the group decision mechanism. Additional insights are obtained when we extend the model. to capture homophily in group formation and the potential that a subset of consumers will never share for ethical reasons.",
"Preferential Attachment, Homophily, and the Structure of International Networks, 1816-2003",CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE,Jul 2012,2012,"This study examines the extent to which network formation processes in international relations parallel models that characterize the formation processes of physical, biological, and social networks. I introduce two influential models from networks sciences: Preferential Attachment (PA) models state that the probability of a new node forming a link with an existing node is a function of the latter node's centrality. Networks that form through a PA process tend to have a power-law degree distribution. The Homophily (HO) model states that nodes tend to attach to similar other nodes. Such networks evolve into a set of homogenous subgroups. An analysis of alliance and trade networks over the 1816 (1870)-2003 period reveals strong evidence that alliance networks are affected by homophily processes. Trade networks form via a preferential attachment process. The tendency of international networks to evolve according to such processes increases over time. I discuss the implications of these results.",
Ethnic heterogeneity in the activity and structure of a Black street gang,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY,Jul 2012,2012,"Despite acknowledgment of 'hybrid' street gangs in the literature, there is little systematic research into ethnic heterogeneity within gangs. This research aims at moving beyond the broad categorization of the Black street gang. For this purpose, we examine an all-Black London-based gang in detail, using fieldwork and police arrest data, and investigate the role of ethnic heterogeneity for the workings of the gang. Our findings suggest that ethnic heterogeneity within this gang is crucial for its criminal operation. Although there is no evidence for ethnicity-related specialization of crime, the structural co-offending pattern of the gang's activities is dominated by ethnicity. Ethnicity matters for who offends with whom.",
"Norms, status and the dynamics of advice networks: A case study",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2012,2012,"The issue of the influence of norms on behavior is as old as sociology itself. This paper explores the effect of normative homophily (i.e. ""sharing the same normative choices"") on the evolution of the advice network among lay judges in a courthouse. Blau's (1955, 1964) social exchange theory suggests that members select advisors based on the status of the advisor. Additional research shows that members of an organization use similarities with others in ascribed, achieved or inherited characteristics, as well as other kinds of ties, to mitigate the potentially negative effects of this strong status rule. We elaborate and test these theories using data on advisor choice in the Commercial Court of Paris. We use a jurisprudential case about unfair competition (material and ""moral"" damages), a case that we submitted to all the judges of this court, to test the effect of normative homophily on the selection of advisors, controlling for status effects. Normative homophily is measured by the extent to which two judges are equally ""punitive"" in awarding damages to plaintiffs. Statistical analyses combine longitudinal advice network data collected among the judges with their normative dispositions. Contrary to what could be expected from conventional sociological theories, we find no pure effect of normative homophily on the choice of advisors. In this case, therefore, sharing the same norms and values does not have, by itself, a mitigating effect and does not contribute to the evolution of the network. We argue that status effects, conformity and alignments on positions of opinion leaders in controversies still provide the best insights into the relationship between norms, structure and behavior.

"An Actor-Based Model of Social Network Influence on Adolescent Body Size, Screen Time, and Playing Sports",PLOS ONE,Jun 29 2012,2012,"Recent studies suggest that obesity may be ""contagious"" between individuals in social networks. Social contagion (influence), however, may not be identifiable using traditional statistical approaches because they cannot distinguish contagion from homophily (the propensity for individuals to select friends who are similar to themselves) or from shared environmental influences. In this paper, we apply the stochastic actor-based model (SABM) framework developed by Snijders and colleagues to data on adolescent body mass index (BMI), screen time, and playing active sports. Our primary hypothesis was that social influences on adolescent body size and related behaviors are independent of friend selection. Employing the SABM, we simultaneously modeled network dynamics (friendship selection based on homophily and structural characteristics of the network) and social influence. We focused on the 2 largest schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and held the school environment constant by examining the 2 school networks separately (N = 624 and 1151). Results show support in both schools for homophily on BMI, but also for social influence on BMI. There was no evidence of homophily on screen time in either school, while only one of the schools showed homophily on playing active sports. There was, however, evidence of social influence on screen time in one of the schools, and playing active sports in both schools. These results suggest that both homophily and social influence are important in understanding patterns of adolescent obesity. Intervention efforts should take into consideration peers' influence on one another, rather than treating ""high risk"" adolescents in isolation.",
Homofilia e homossexualidades: recepções culturais e permanências,História (São Paulo),2012-06,2012,"The complete historicizatization of homosexualities (gays, lesbians, travesties, transsexuals, intersex, MSM etc.) as identity categories and its different representations over time is not the objective of this work. My objective is to demonstrate that these connotations of identity, in special the disqualified identity, are something contingent and historical, forged under the difficulties of each social group to deal with the difference. Intrinsically linked to the global social organization, both their forms of representation, the sanctions that have been assigned to them, as well as their modes of assimilation can vary culturally.",
DO WOMEN MANAGERS AMELIORATE GENDER DIFFERENCES IN WAGES? EVIDENCE FROM A LARGE A LARGE GROCERY RETAILER,SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,SUM 2012,2012,"Women's disadvantages in labor market outcomes are often attributed to the preponderance of men at or near the top of organizational hierarchies. While theories of homophily predict that women in positions of power ameliorate gender differences in wages for employees under them, status characteristics theory suggests that women face comparable disadvantages when working under men and women. Despite the existence of competing theoretical perspectives, there is little empirical work investigating the effect of women in positions of organizational power on gender inequality among their subordinates. This study makes an important contribution to this literature by using employment records from 3,707 employees at a large U.S.-based grocery retailer over nine years to examine how the gender gap in wages varies in establishments with male and female managers. Consistent with status characteristics theory, the authors find no significant differences between male and female managers in terms of gender-based wage inequality among their employees.",
Homophily Through Nonreciprocity: Results of an Experiment,SOCIAL FORCES,Jun 2012,2012,"This study outlines a new explanation for homophily in social networks that is neither intended nor imposed by constraints on partner choices. Rather, homophily is an endogenous product of the emergent exchange process, in which actors seek high-value partners who reciprocate their gestures. Whereas all actors initially direct exchange toward higher value partners, the gestures of lower value actors are more likely to go unreciprocated. This imbalance drives lower value actors to seek new partners, who end up being others who are also lower value. The consequence is homophily on value despite no such preference. I draw upon social exchange theory to articulate how this process unfolds in a newly forming network. A laboratory experiment tests hypotheses about how exchange patterns change over time. Findings reveal that shifts in participants' behavior over time were consistent with a concern for reciprocity, resulting in increasing levels of homophily in the network.",
Reputation management in an open source developer social network: An empirical study on determinants of positive evaluations,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Jun 2012,2012,"Successful development of open source software (OSS) projects requires a steady supply of self motivated software developers. Thus a large body of OSS studies focuses on studying the developers' participation motivations. One important motivation is an OSS developer's desire to gain good community reputation which is largely based on positive evaluations from his peers. Therefore, to better motivate developers' project participations through their reputation needs, our empirical analysis adopted a social network perspective to study what factors may affect a developer's decision to positively evaluate one other in a large online open source community called Ohloh. The results surprisingly show that a developer's positive evaluation decision does not depend on his evaluatee's level of OSS-related experience, but rather based on 1) his past reputation (i.e. existing number of positive evaluations), 2) their shared affiliations such as mutual acquaintances, as well as 3) their homophily in location (city), nationality, programming language preference, and community status. We then discuss these findings and their implications for inducing more positive evaluations and better reputation management among open source project members. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first research that investigates issues of reputation building and relationship management in an open source development context.

Social Networks and Career Advancement of People With Disabilities,HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW,Jun 2012,2012,"Although organizational social networks are known to influence career mobility, the specific direction of this influence is different for diverse employee groups. Diversity in organizational network research has been operationalized on various dimensions such as race and ethnicity, age, religion, education, occupation, and gender. Missing in this stream of research are application and implications of social networks as they influence career advancement of people with disabilities. The objective of this conceptual article is to outline how social network characteristics such as network density, multiplexity, cohesiveness, and homophily influence career advancement of individuals with a disability. The author concludes by proposing that human resource development professionals can engage in structured socialization programs, network audits, focused training, and the creation of an inclusive climate to ensure that social networks do not pose a deterrent to career advancement of minorities such as people with a disability.",
Interpersonal similarity and knowledge sharing within multinational organizations,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW,Jun 2012,2012,"Previous research has established that interpersonal similarity can influence knowledge sharing in such a way that similar people are more likely to share knowledge than those who are dissimilar. We contribute to the literature by showing that in the MNC context, cultural and functional similarity can become more powerful sources of bias than more commonly assumed demographic characteristics such as gender or seniority. This may be driven by the salience of such boundaries in the MNC: while demographic characteristics are more broadly distributed, cultural and functional barriers create more defined and observable faultlines, often coinciding with unit boundaries. We further argue that it may not be similarity as such that matters but rather its positive impact on different dimensions of social capital, which mediate the relationship between similarity and knowledge sharing. These microfoundations of inter-unit knowledge exchange point to important theoretical and practical implications for international management. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
Kinship Shapes Affiliative Social Networks but Not Aggression in Ring-Tailed Coatis,PLOS ONE,May 18 2012,2012,"Animal groups typically contain individuals with varying degrees of genetic relatedness, and this variation in kinship has a major influence on patterns of aggression and affiliative behaviors. This link between kinship and social behavior underlies socioecological models which have been developed to explain how and why different types of animal societies evolve. We tested if kinship and age-sex class homophily in two groups of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) predicted the network structure of three different social behaviors: 1) association, 2) grooming, and 3) aggression. Each group was studied during two consecutive years, resulting in four group-years available for analysis (total of 65 individuals). Association patterns were heavily influenced by agonistic interactions which typically occurred during feeding competition. Grooming networks were shaped by mother-offspring bonds, female-female social relationships, and a strong social attraction to adult males. Mother-offspring pairs were more likely to associate and groom each other, but relatedness had no effect on patterns of aggressive behavior. Additionally, kinship had little to no effect on coalitionary support during agonistic interactions. Adult females commonly came to the aid of juveniles during fights with other group members, but females often supported juveniles who were not their offspring (57% of coalitionary interactions). These patterns did not conform to predictions from socioecological models.",
Extensible software for whole of society modeling: framework and preliminary results,SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL,May 2012,2012,"In order to extend the ongoing academic and practitioner dialogs germane to Human, Social, Cultural, and Behavioral (HSCB) modeling and simulation, we introduce a novel extensible methodology for modeling Complex Adaptive Social Systems (CASS) that centers on capturing the emergence of dynamic Beliefs, Values, and Interests (BVIs) in the individuals and groups that compose a whole society. We follow Peter Blau, Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin, Duncan Watts and many others in positing that human behavior is best understood in terms of the complex social systems within which actions are taken, and that the representation of these social systems must make evident the endogenous structural constraints on opportunities for interpersonal contact and group affiliation. We further demonstrate that the ability to seed social simulations with representative social data about the society being modeled (e.g. from social surveys), and the use of social networks generated using principles of homophily from empirical social science, provide a compelling and actionable framework for both interpreting with and theory building from whole society simulations.",
"Social Movement Organizational Collaboration: Networks of Learning and the Diffusion of Protest Tactics, 1960-1995",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,May 2012,2012,"This article examines the diffusion of protest tactics among social movement organizations (SMOs) through their collaboration in protest groups. Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics. Finally, initial overlap in respective tactical repertoires facilitates the diffusion of tactics among collaborating SMOs.",
Friendship Prediction and Homophily in Social Media,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB,May 2012,2012,"Social media have attracted considerable attention because their open-ended nature allows users to create lightweight semantic scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social and topical components of social media has been only partially explored. Here, we study the presence of homophily in three systems that combine tagging social media with online social networks. We find a substantial level of topical similarity among users who are close to each other in the social network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local similarity between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that users with similar interests are more likely to be friends, and therefore topical similarity measures among users based solely on their annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this hypothesis on several datasets, confirming that social networks constructed from topical similarity capture actual friendship accurately. When combined with topological features, topical similarity achieves a link prediction accuracy of about 92%.",
Do diverse geographical contexts lead to diverse friendship networks? A multilevel analysis of Belgian survey data,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS,May 2012,2012,"The choice-constraint approach assumes that the choice of one's friends will be determined by both individual choices and the constraints imposed by one's interaction context. Trends towards homophily however, might counteract this effect if actors consistently seek interaction partners with the same background characteristics. In this study we investigate the impact of community level diversity on the cultural diversity of friendship networks. Based on a multilevel analysis of recent survey data from Flanders (Belgium). we demonstrate that community level diversity has a significant but limited impact on ethnic and religious friendship network diversity. Controlling for individual level characteristics, residents of ethnically diverse communities report more ethnically and religiously diverse friendships. The fact that ethnic and religious diversity overlap to such a large extent suggests that both divisions are closely related in contemporary secularized European societies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Motivation vs. relevance: Using strong ties to find a job in Urban China,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,May 2012,2012,"While the idea that contacts matter in finding a job is intuitively appealing, we still do not know-after decades of research-how and why strong ties benefit job seekers. To resolve this confusion, we need to theorize how specific characteristics of ties are related to the mechanisms that make job search through contacts effective. We have reasons to expect that, while a contact's motivation influences the likelihood that a job seeker receives an offer, her homophily with the job seeker on occupation and other job-relevant attributes influences the quality of the offer. The use of strong ties among university students to find jobs in China provides a unique opportunity to empirically isolate the relationship between contact characteristics and the mechanisms through which contacts benefit the job seeker. I tested my hypotheses with data on both the successful and unsuccessful job searches of 478 graduates of China's flagship universities, who, as first-time job seekers, primarily used strong ties. Survey results are consistent with my hypotheses: job seekers who used strong ties to look for jobs had more offers-but not better offers-than those who used only formal methods.

"Don't mention it: Why people don't share job information, when they do, and why it matters",SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2012,2012,"Network-based job search is especially likely to foster workplace segregation and limit status attainment when information flows through homophilous ties. This paper takes the perspective of information holders and examines how the use of strong versus weak ties - which tend to be homophilous and heterophilous, respectively - differs with characteristics of labour markets in which jobs are located. Using in-depth interviews with entry-level white collar workers I show that information holders with opportunities to mention specific jobs to specific people do so only 27% of the time. Because they hesitate to share information if they are uncertain the information is specifically sought, information flows more commonly to strong ties, whose career goals are more likely to be known. Information is more likely to be shared with weak ties if it concerns occupations for which one may be specifically credentialed, since receiving relevant training serves as signal of interest in such jobs. These finding suggest that the homophily of referrals and their inequality-generating effects may vary across occupations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Ordered community structure in networks,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Apr 15 2012,2012,"Community structure in networks is often a consequence of homophily, or assortative mixing, based on some attribute of the vertices. For example, researchers may be grouped into communities corresponding to their research topic. This is possible if vertex attributes have unordered discrete values, but many networks exhibit assortative mixing by some ordered (discrete or continuous) attribute, such as age or geographical location. In such cases, the identification of discrete communities may be difficult or impossible. We consider how the notion of community structure can be generalized to networks that have assortative mixing by ordered attributes. We propose a method of generating synthetic networks with ordered communities and investigate the effect of ordered community structure on the spread of infectious diseases. We also show that current community detection algorithms fail to recover community structure in ordered networks, and evaluate an alternative method using a layout algorithm to recover the ordering.

"Neuropsychiatric Genetics of Happiness, Friendships, and Politics: Hypothesizing Homophily (""Birds of a Feather Flock Together"") as a Function of Reward Gene Polymorphisms.",Journal of genetic syndromes & gene therapy,2012-Apr-13,2012,"Mindful of the new evolutionary ideas related to an emerging scientific focus known as omics, we propose that spiritual, social, and political behaviors may be tied in part to inheritable reward gene polymorphisms, as has been demonstrated for the addictions. If so, analyses of gene polymorphisms may assist in predicting liberalism or conservatism in partisan attachments. For example, both drinking (alcohol) and obesity seem to cluster in large social networks and are influenced by friends having the same genotype, in particular the DRD2 A1 allele. Likewise, voting, voting turnout and attachment to a particular political ideology is differentially related to various reward genes (e.g., 5HTT, MOA, DRD2, and DRD4), possibly predicting liberalism or conservatism. Moreover, voters' genetic information may predict presidential outcomes more than the actual issues at hand or the presidential candidates themselves. Thus, political discussions on TV, radio, or other media may be morphed by one's reward gene polymorphisms and as such, may explain the prevalence of generations of die-hard republicans and equally entrenched democratic legacies. Indeed, even in politics, birds of a feather (homophily) flock together. We caution that our proposal should be viewed mindfully awaiting additional research before definitive statements or conclusions can be derived from the studies to date, and we encourage large scale studies to confirm these earlier reports.",
Accelerating consensus on coevolving networks: The effect of committed individuals,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Apr 6 2012,2012,"Social networks are not static but, rather, constantly evolve in time. One of the elements thought to drive the evolution of social network structure is homophily-the need for individuals to connect with others who are similar to them. In this paper, we study how the spread of a new opinion, idea, or behavior on such a homophily-driven social network is affected by the changing network structure. In particular, using simulations, we study a variant of the Axelrod model on a network with a homophily-driven rewiring rule imposed. First, we find that the presence of rewiring within the network, in general, impedes the reaching of consensus in opinion, as the time to reach consensus diverges exponentially with network size N. We then investigate whether the introduction of committed individuals who are rigid in their opinion on a particular issue can speed up the convergence to consensus on that issue. We demonstrate that as committed agents are added, beyond a critical value of the committed fraction, the consensus time growth becomes logarithmic in network size N. Furthermore, we show that slight changes in the interaction rule can produce strikingly different results in the scaling behavior of consensus time, T-c. However, the benefit gained by introducing committed agents is qualitatively preserved across all the interaction rules we consider.",
"Similarity of parents and physicians in the decision to vaccinate children against measles, mumps and rubella",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Apr 2012,2012,"Objectives This study investigates parental decisions to vaccinate their children against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Parent and provider survey data allow the analysis of interactions between these major players in decision making.Methods Three datasets are used for analysis: (a) the basic population of the school entry-level health checkup in Munich, Germany; (b) a face-to-face survey with parents of children taking the school entry-level health checkup; (c) a face-to-face survey of the physicians treating these children. Logistic, OLS and multilevel regressions were applied.Results Homophily due to similar ages of parents and physicians boosts the decision to vaccinate children against MMR. Also in relation to parent-physician interaction, the fact that a physician may be homeopathic has no effect on a parents' decision to immunize, although vaccination-skeptical parents choose physicians who are trained in homeopathy.Conclusions Efforts to improve the number of parental decisions for vaccination should focus on the educational level of the parents as well as homophily of parents and physicians. Notably, homogeneity of parents and providers concerning age changes decisions in favor of vaccinating.",
THE AXELROD MODEL FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF CULTURE REVISITED,ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY,Apr 2012,2012,"This article is concerned with the Axelrod model, a stochastic process which similarly to the voter model includes social influence, but unlike the voter model also accounts for homophily. Each vertex of the network of interactions is characterized by a set of F cultural features, each of which can assume q states. Pairs of adjacent vertices interact at a rate proportional to the number of features they share, which results in the interacting pair having one more cultural feature in common. The Axelrod model has been extensively studied during the past ten years, based on numerical simulations and simple mean-field treatments, while there is a total lack of analytical results for the spatial model itself. Simulation results for the one-dimensional system led physicists to formulate the following conjectures. When the number of features F and the number of states q both equal two, or when the number of features exceeds the number of states, the system converges to a monocultural equilibrium in the sense that the number of cultural domains resealed by the population size converges to zero as the population goes to infinity. In contrast, when the number of states exceeds the number of features, the system freezes in a highly fragmented configuration in which the ultimate number of cultural domains scales like the population size. In this article, we prove analytically for the one-dimensional system convergence to a monocultural equilibrium in terms of clustering when F = q = 2, as well as fixation to a highly fragmented configuration when the number of states is sufficiently larger than the number of features. Our first result also implies clustering of the one-dimensional constrained voter model.",
A graph-based action network framework to identify prestigious members through member's prestige evolution,DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS,Apr 2012,2012,"Prestigious members on social networking websites are attracting increasing attentions from peers and corporations. People are used to consulting prestigious members for useful information and corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for ""word of mouth"" advertising. Identification and recognition of these prestigious members have been a crucial issue. Besides, the dynamic nature of members' behaviour determines the evolving nature of members' prestige. With the evolution of members' behaviour, currently prestigious members may be substituted by others who are not prestigious at present. The prediction of members' prestige evolution will help discover potential prestigious members, which will then help both people and corporations move to secure their long-term interests. However, little work has been done in relation to prediction of prestigious members. This paper aims to fill this gap specially using Flickr groups as a testbed. By investigating social actions among members, a graph-based action network framework to predict evolution of prestigious members has been proposed. Based on the social structural theory, which points out the interactive effect between social structure and users' actions, a favor action network that captures the social actions of choosing favourite photos of members is constructed. According to the network theory, properties of the nodes in the favor action network are investigated to identify currently prestigious members, and structural properties underlying the favor action network are mined to analyze the communication behaviour of members in a group. Further, the sociological theory inspires four key factors that affect members' favor action intentions, which are homophily, triadic interaction rule, continuity and recency. Based on the above analysis, a hybrid algorithm taking all these four factors into account is proposed to predict members' prestige evolution. Finally, several comprehensive and systematic analyses are designed and conducted to evaluate each of the functional components of the proposed framework. Results of evaluation on a real-world dataset validate its performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Mobilizing homeless youth for HIV prevention: a social network analysis of the acceptability of a face-to-face and online social networking intervention,HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH,Apr 2012,2012,"The objective of the study is to use social network analysis to examine the acceptability of a youth-led, hybrid face-to-face and online social networking HIV prevention program for homeless youth.Seven peer leaders (PLs) engaged face-to-face homeless youth (F2F) in the creation of digital media projects (e.g. You Tube videos). PL and F2F recruited online youth (OY) to participate in MySpace and Facebook communities where digital media was disseminated and discussed. The resulting social networks were assessed with respect to size, growth, density, relative centrality of positions and homophily of ties. Seven PL, 53 F2F and 103 OY created two large networks. After the first 50 F2F youth participated, online networks entered a rapid growth phase. OY were among the most central youth in these networks. Younger aged persons and females were disproportionately connected to like youth. The program appears highly acceptable to homeless youth. Social network analysis revealed which PL were the most critical to the program and which types of participants (younger youth and females) may require additional outreach efforts in the future.",
The Double Edge of Common Interest: Ethnic Segregation as an Unintended Byproduct of Opinion Homophily,SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION,Apr 2012,2012,"How can we reduce ethnic friendship segregation in ethnically heterogeneous schools? The Common Ingroup Identity Model suggests that interethnic friendships are promoted by those intervention programs that focus on the interests students have in common. The authors argue that the outcome of these common interest interventions may crucially depend on sufficient consensus in participants' opinions regarding the shared interest. Such an intervention may backfire and increase ethnic segregation if participants from different ethnic groups have different opinions about the common interest. The authors test their argument analyzing the dynamics of friendship networks and opinions in 48 school classes with an actor-based stochastic model. Their findings suggest that salient common interests in ethnically mixed school classes can indeed reduce ethnic segregation. However, they also found that friendship selection on the basis of similar opinions can foster ethnic segregation. This occurred when ethnicity was correlated with the opinions that students held regarding the salient interest, even when these students did not prefer intra-ethnic friendship per se.",
Change in Friendship Homophily: A German Israeli Comparison of Adolescent Immigrants,JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY,Apr 2012,2012,"This longitudinal study investigated friendship homophily (i.e., the preference for intra-ethnic over inter-ethnic friends) among immigrant adolescents in Israel and Germany. Based on acculturation theories and known differences between Israel and Germany in the establishment of Russian-speaking immigrant communities in these countries, it was hypothesized that levels and rates of change in friendship homophily would differ. Associations between context- and acculturation-related variables and levels and rates of change in adolescent friendship homophily were also tested. The sample consisted of 877 Russian Jewish and 358 ethnic German Diaspora migrant adolescents (i.e., migrants returning to the country of their ancestors from the former Soviet Union). Results confirmed higher levels and a less pronounced decrease of friendship homophily in Israel as compared to Germany. Especially acculturation-related variables were found to be best at predicting intercept and slope of friendship homophily. Findings also showed that differences in levels and rates of change in adolescent friendship homophily between both countries could be explained by language use; thus, using the new host language more often appeared to be a crucial variable for lower levels of friendship homophily. Overall, results suggest very similar adaptation processes toward lower friendship homophily in the two countries but at a different pace over time.",
Choosing a gambling partner: testing a model of mutual insurance in the lab,THEORY AND DECISION,Apr 2012,2012,"In this study, we investigate how economic agents choose gambling partners and how paired risky choices differ from individual ones. To this aim, we develop a simple model and design a laboratory experiment that allows us to compare individual versus paired decisions across two treatments, where pairs are, respectively, exogenously and endogenously formed. In both treatments, paired subjects decide individually and independently how to allocate their wealth over a portfolio of lotteries and fully commit to share any winnings. The main result from our experiment is that whenever agents are allowed to choose a gambling partner they decide to team up with other agents who display the same degree of risk aversion as themselves. Moreover, paired choices consistently involve higher risk taking than individual choices. This finding is more evident when information on subjects' risk attitudes is made available and when subjects team up in homogeneous pairs, thereby confirming that subjects successfully exploit the benefits of mutual insurance.",
"Segregation in Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Youth's Personal Networks: Testing Structural Constraint, Choice Homophily and Compartmentalization Hypotheses",SOCIAL FORCES,Mar 2012,2012,"Homophily promotes the development of social relationships within social groups and increases segregation across groups. Although prior research has demonstrated that network segregation operates in many dimensions such as race and gender, sexual orientation has received little attention. This study investigates what accounts for the segregation between gay, lesbian and bisexual friends and straight friends in GLB youth's personal networks by testing three possible underlying mechanisms - structural constraints, choice homophily and compartmentalization attempts. The analysis uses data collected from GLB youth who were becoming members of a community organization in Indiana from 1994 through 1998. Although the small, convenience sample does not allow generalization of the results, the rich network data provide important insights into personal network segregation in this unique social context. The results suggest that the segregation between GLB and straight friends result from structural constraints and friends' preference to interact within their groups, and that the focal GLB youth's effort to compartmentalize his or her sexual identity accounts little for the segregation.",
Modeling History Dependence in Network-Behavior Coevolution,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,SPR 2012,2012,"Spatial interdependence-the dependence of outcomes in some units on those in others-is substantively and theoretically ubiquitous and central across the social sciences. Spatial association is also omnipresent empirically. However, spatial association may arise from three importantly distinct processes: common exposure of actors to exogenous external and internal stimuli, interdependence of outcomes/behaviors across actors (contagion), and/or the putative outcomes may affect the dimensions along which the clustering occurs (selection). Accurate inference about any of these processes generally requires an empirical strategy that addresses all three well. From a spatial-econometric perspective, this suggests spatiotemporal empirical models with exogenous covariates (common exposure) and spatial lags (contagion), with the spatial weights being endogenous (selection). From a longitudinal network-analytic perspective, the same three processes are identified as potential sources of network effects and network formation. From that perspective, actors' self-selection into networks (by, e.g., behavioral homophily) and actors' behavior that is contagious through those network connections likewise demands theoretical and empirical models in which networks and behavior coevolve over time. This paper begins building such models by, on theoretical side, extending a Markov type-interaction model to allow endogenous tie-formation, and, on empirical side, merging a simple spatial-lag logit model of contagious behavior with a simple p(*)-logit model of network formation. One interesting consequence of network-behavior coevolution-identically, endogenous patterns of spatial interdependence-emphasized here is how it can produce history-dependent political dynamics, including equilibrium phat and path dependence (Page 2006). The paper concludes with an illustrative application to alliance formation and conflict behavior among the great powers in the first half of the twentieth century.",
Rating Performance or Contesting Status: Evidence Against the Homophily Explanation for Supervisor Demographic Skew in Performance Ratings,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,MAR-APR 2012,2012,"We propose and test an argument in which the well-documented skew in supervisory performance appraisal ratings toward those with the same demography as themselves is better explained by the status contests than the reigning theory of homophily. We conduct the test in a field study of 358 supervisor-subordinate dyads in 10 organizations, using hierarchical linear modeling with various controls. We find that supervisors' ratings of subordinates' contextual and task performance only skew toward similar subordinates when supervisors' status is contested by a higher demographic status subordinate, as predicted by social dominance and status characteristics theories. None of the general homophily preference hypotheses is supported. This study provides a richer theory more consistent with the accumulating evidence about demography effects in organizations and demonstrates the value of head-to-head strong inference tests and status explanations for the field of organizational behavior.",
The socio-demographics of texting: An analysis of traffic data,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Mar 2012,2012,"Who texts, and with whom do they text? This article examines the use of texting using metered traffic data from a large dataset (nearly 400 million anonymous text messages). We ask: 1) How much do different age groups use mobile phone based texting (SMS)? 2) How wide is the circle of texting partners for different age groups? 3) To what degree are texting relationships characterized by age and gender homophily? We find that texting is hugely popular among teens compared to other age groups. Further, the number of persons with whom people text is quite small. About half of all text messages go to only five other persons. Finally, we find that there is pronounced homophily in terms of age and gender in texting relationships. These findings support previous claims that texting is an important element of teen culture and is an element in the construction of a bounded solidarity.",
Social Networks and the Diffusion of User-Generated Content: Evidence from YouTube,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,Mar 2012,2012,"This paper is motivated by the success of YouTube, which is attractive to content creators as well as corporations for its potential to rapidly disseminate digital content. The networked structure of interactions on YouTube and the tremendous variation in the success of videos posted online lends itself to an inquiry of the role of social influence. Using a unique data set of video information and user information collected from YouTube, we find that social interactions are influential not only in determining which videos become successful but also on the magnitude of that impact. We also find evidence for a number of mechanisms by which social influence is transmitted, such as (i) a preference for conformity and homophily and (ii) the role of social networks in guiding opinion formation and directing product search and discovery. Econometrically, the problem in identifying social influence is that individuals' choices depend in great part upon the choices of other individuals, referred to as the reflection problem. Another problem in identification is to distinguish between social contagion and user heterogeneity in the diffusion process. Our results are in sharp contrast to earlier models of diffusion, such as the Bass model, that do not distinguish between different social processes that are responsible for the process of diffusion. Our results are robust to potential self-selection according to user tastes, temporal heterogeneity and the reflection problem. Implications for researchers and managers are discussed.",
Peer Selection and Socialization in Adolescent Depression: The Role of School Transitions,JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE,Mar 2012,2012,"Previous studies have indicated homophily in depressive symptoms among adolescent friends, resulting from both peer selection and socialization processes. However, developmental differences and the role of school transitions in these processes have not been elucidated. A sample of 367 (51% female) adolescents was followed from 6th to 11th grade to investigate prospective relationships between adolescents' and their friends' depressive symptoms in middle school and in high school. Results revealed that students selected friends with similar levels of depressive symptoms after each school transition. Additionally, friends appeared to socialize adolescents to become more similar in depressive affect in late middle school years. These findings suggest normative selection effects after school transitions, followed by socialization effects in middle school, but not high school.",
A Confidant Support and Problem Solving Model of Divorced Fathers' Parenting,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,Mar 2012,2012,"This study tested a hypothesized social interaction learning (SIL) model of confidant support and paternal parenting. The latent growth curve analysis employed 230 recently divorced fathers, of which 177 enrolled support confidants, to test confidant support as a predictor of problem solving outcomes and problem solving outcomes as predictors of change in fathers' parenting. Fathers' parenting was hypothesized to predict growth in child behavior. Observational measures of support behaviors and problem solving outcomes were obtained from structured discussions of personal and parenting issues faced by the fathers. Findings replicated and extended prior cross-sectional studies with divorced mothers and their confidants. Confidant support predicted better problem solving outcomes, problem solving predicted more effective parenting, and parenting in turn predicted growth in children's reduced total problem behavior T scores over 18 months. Supporting a homophily perspective, fathers' antisociality was associated with confidant antisociality but only fathers' antisociality influenced the support process model. Intervention implications are discussed regarding SIL parent training and social support.",
Roommate's race and the racial composition of white college students' ego networks,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Mar 2012,2012,"We develop and test a new hypothesis about how the race of a college freshman's roommate affects the racial composition of the student's ego network. Together, three principles of social structure proximity, homophily, and transitivity logically imply that college students assigned a roommate of a given race will have more friends (other than their roommate) of that race than will students assigned a roommate not of that race. A test with data collected from 195 white freshmen at Stanford University in the spring of 2002 supports this prediction. Our analysis advances earlier work by predicting and providing evidence of race-specific effects: While students assigned a different-race roommate of a given race have more friends (other than their roommate) of their roommate's race, they do not have more different-race friends not of their roommate's race.

Health professional networks as a vector for improving healthcare quality and safety: a systematic review,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,Mar 2012,2012,"Background: While there is a considerable corpus of theoretical and empirical literature on networks within and outside of the health sector, multiple research questions are yet to be answered.Objective: To conduct a systematic review of studies of professionals' network structures, identifying factors associated with network effectiveness and sustainability, particularly in relation to quality of care and patient safety.Methods: The authors searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science and Business Source Premier from January 1995 to December 2009.Results: A majority of the 26 unique studies identified used social network analysis to examine structural relationships in networks: structural relationships within and between networks, health professionals and their social context, health collaboratives and partnerships, and knowledge sharing networks. Key aspects of networks explored were administrative and clinical exchanges, network performance, integration, stability and influences on the quality of healthcare. More recent studies show that cohesive and collaborative health professional networks can facilitate the coordination of care and contribute to improving quality and safety of care. Structural network vulnerabilities include cliques, professional and gender homophily, and over-reliance on central agencies or individuals.Conclusions: Effective professional networks employ natural structural network features (eg, bridges, brokers, density, centrality, degrees of separation, social capital, trust) in producing collaboratively oriented healthcare. This requires efficient transmission of information and social and professional interaction within and across networks. For those using networks to improve care, recurring success factors are understanding your network's characteristics, attending to its functioning and investing time in facilitating its improvement. Despite this, there is no guarantee that time spent on networks will necessarily improve patient care.",
A study of homophily on social media,WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Mar 2012,2012,"The fact that similarity breeds connections, the principle of homophily, has been well-studied in existing sociology literature. Several studies have observed this phenomenon by conducting surveys on human subjects. These studies have concluded that new ties are formed between similar individuals. This phenomenon has been used to explain several socio-psychological concepts such as, segregation, community development, social mobility, etc. However, due to the nature of these studies and limitations because of involvement of human subjects, conclusions from these studies are not easily extensible in online social media. Social media, which is becoming the infinite space for interactions, has exceeded all the expectations in terms of growth, for reasons beyond human mind. New ties are formed in social media in the same way that they emerge in real-world. However, given the differences between real world and online social media, do the same factors that govern the construction of new ties in real world also govern the construction of new ties in social media? In other words, does homophily exist in social media? In this article, we study this extremely significant question. We propose a systematic approach by studying three online social media sites, BlogCatalog, Last.fm, and LiveJournal and report our findings along with some interesting observations. The results indicate that the influence of interest-based homophily is not a very strong leading factor for constructing new ties specifically in the three social media sites with implications to strategic advertising, recommendations, and promoting applications at large.",
"Method for managing resources for group of users with common behaviors, involves modifying accessibility of resource with respect to secondary domain for at least other users in group of users based on at least one user behavior",,,,"NOVELTY - The users are categorized (406) according to common user characteristics and common user behaviors with respect to a primary domain to yield a group of users. A resource associated with user behavior is identified (408) in a secondary domain different during a primary time interval for at least one user from the group of users. An accessibility of the resource is modified (410) with respect to the secondary domain for at least other users in the group of users based on the at least one user behavior during a secondary time interval after the primary time interval. USE - Method for managing resources for a group of users with common characteristics and/or common behaviors based on social synchrony and homophily of users. ADVANTAGE - The users in a group based on common user characteristics or common user behaviors generally tend to act in a similar manner. Thus, users in such a group not only perform the same actions, but typically require access to the same resources to perform such actions. The resources can be managed based on user behaviors efficiently, thus improving accessibility of the resources by the users. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:(1) system for managing resources; and(2) non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing program for managing resources. DESCRIPTION Of DRAWING(S) - The drawing shows a flowchart illustrating a process for managing resource.Resource management process (400)Step for obtaining data indicating users characteristics and users behaviors (404)Step for categorizing users according to common user characteristics and common user behaviors (406)Step for identifying resource associated with at least one user behavior (408)Step for modifying accessibility of resource (410)",
Social networks and cooperation in hunter-gatherers,NATURE,Jan 26 2012,2012,"Social networks show striking structural regularities(1,2), and both theory and evidence suggest that networks may have facilitated the development of large-scale cooperation in humans(3-7). Here, we characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers in Tanzania(8). We show that Hadza networks have important properties also seen in modernized social networks, including a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity, transitivity, reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We demonstrate that Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in public goods game donations. Network ties are also more likely between people who give the same amount, and the similarity in cooperative behaviour extends up to two degrees of separation. Social distance appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an early point in human history. Also, early humans may have formed ties with both kin and non-kin, based in part on their tendency to cooperate. Social networks may thus have contributed to the emergence of cooperation.",
Reconciling long-term cultural diversity and short-term collective social behavior,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jan 24 2012,2012,"An outstanding open problem is whether collective social phenomena occurring over short timescales can systematically reduce cultural heterogeneity in the long run, and whether offline and online human interactions contribute differently to the process. Theoretical models suggest that short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity are mutually excluding, since they require very different levels of social influence. The latter jointly depends on two factors: the topology of the underlying social network and the overlap between individuals in multidimensional cultural space. However, while the empirical properties of social networks are intensively studied, little is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in cultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used in models. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional analysis of the scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find that interopinion correlations determine a nontrivial ultrametric hierarchy of individuals in cultural space. When empirical data are used as inputs in models, ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive effects. On short timescales, it facilitates a symmetry-breaking phase transition triggering coordinated social behavior. On long timescales, it suppresses cultural convergence by restricting it within disjoint groups. Moreover, ultrametricity implies that these results are surprisingly robust to modifications of the dynamical rules considered. Thus the empirical distribution of individuals in cultural space appears to systematically optimize the coexistence of short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity, which can be realized simultaneously for the same moderate level of mutual influence in a diverse range of online and offline settings.",
Modeling the Adoption of Innovations in the Presence of Geographic and Media Influences,PLOS ONE,Jan 19 2012,2012,"While there is a large body of work examining the effects of social network structure on innovation adoption, models to date have lacked considerations of real geography or mass media. In this article, we show these features are crucial to making more accurate predictions of a social contagion and technology adoption at a city-to-city scale. Using data from the adoption of the popular micro-blogging platform, Twitter, we present a model of adoption on a network that places friendships in real geographic space and exposes individuals to mass media influence. We show that homophily both among individuals with similar propensities to adopt a technology and geographic location is critical to reproducing features of real spatiotemporal adoption. Furthermore, we estimate that mass media was responsible for increasing Twitter's user base two to four fold. To reflect this strength, we extend traditional contagion models to include an endogenous mass media agent that responds to those adopting an innovation as well as influencing agents to adopt themselves.",
Social selection and peer influence in an online social network,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Jan 3 2012,2012,"Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over time? Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social processes.",
Evolution of social encounters in ad-hoc mobile face-to-face interaction networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2012 ASE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL INFORMATICS (SOCIALINFORMATICS 2012),2012,2012,"Several studies have suggested that propinquity, social, physical and psychological similarities are the major social processes required for the evolution social ties. This study attempts to understand the effect of these social processes on the creation of social encounters at different lengths of interaction. Co-location and communication sensors in mass-market mobile phones were used to capture the health-related behaviors and face-to-face interactions amongst the residents of an university dorm during the academic year of 2008-09. We examine, via empirical analysis, the impact of social factors, such as difference in life styles, physical appearance and similarities of social and cultural factors, on the likelihood of social encounters at different lengths of interactions using the automatically captured social data. Results suggest that social processes that may engender social interactions have different effects at various levels of interactions and that networks can defined by strength of interactions and not only by type (e.g close friendships, teams).",

Mining Divergent Opinion Trust Networks through Latent Dirichlet Allocation,2012 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM),2012,2012,"While the focus of trust research has been mainly on defining and modeling various notions of social trust, less attention has been given to modeling opinion trust. When speaking of social trust mainly homophily (similarity) has been the most successful metric for learning trustworthy links, specially in social web applications such as collaborative filtering recommendation systems. While pure homophily such as Pearson coefficient correlation and its variations, have been favorable to finding taste distances between individuals based on their rated items, they are not necessarily useful in finding opinion distances between individuals discussing a trending topic, e. g. Arab spring. At the same time text mining techniques, such as vector-based techniques, are not capable of capturing important factors such as saliency or polarity which are possible with topical models for detecting, analyzing and suggesting aspects of people mentioning those tags or topics. Thus, in this paper we are proposing to model opinion distances using probabilistic information divergence as a metric for measuring the distances between people's opinion contributing to a discussion in a social network. To acquire feature sets from topics discussed in a discussion we use a very successful topic modeling technique, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use the distributions resulting to model topics for generating social networks of group and individual users. Using a Twitter dataset we show that learned graphs exhibit properties of real-world like networks.",
Connecting People at a Conference: A Study of Influence Between Offline and Online Using a Mobile Social Application,"2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREEN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, CONFERENCE ON INTERNET OF THINGS, AND CONFERENCE ON CYBER, PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL COMPUTING (GREENCOM 2012)",2012,2012,"Location-based mobile applications such as Foursquare and Jiepang help bridge the gap between offline and online. People that we encounter and connect with around physical resources such as conferences, provide opportunities for extending our social networks from offline to online. We give a preliminary study on the relationship between the online and physical social networks in terms of the online and offline interactions (O2O) established during the conference, using a mobile social proximity-based platform called Find & Connect. We propose metrics of overlap fraction, network scale, and O2O transfer amount to quantify the O2O behavior of conference attendees. Our results demonstrate that more than half of the online interactions are included in the offline interaction network, and the offline to online transfer holds the dominant position in this bidirectional O2O transition between online and offline interaction networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the influence of offline to online, and vice versa, in a restricted environment using a social proximity-based system.",
Peer Influence and Homophily in the Diffusion of the iPhone 3G in a Very Large Social Network,"Proceedings of 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom/PASSAT 2012)",2012,2012,"This paper studies the effects of peer influence and homophily on the diffusion of the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled from a large dataset from a major European Mobile carrier in one country. We use Stochastic Actor Based Models to capture the co-evolution of the social network as well as the dynamics of adoption. This helps to separate the roles of homophily and peer influence in the process of diffusion. We provide evidence that the propensity of a subscriber to adopt, when she is called upon to make a decision about whether she should adopt, increases with the number of friends that have already adopted. A one standard deviation increase above the mean in the number of friends that had already adopted increases the likelihood odds of adoption relative to no adoption by a factor of 2.8. The effect of peer influence is robust across a number of different specifications. The results for the effect of homophily are less clear. While, on average, we find a positive significant effect of adoption on tie formation, in many communities this effect is significant and negative and in others there is no effect at all.",
Using Randomization to Identify Social Influence in Mobile Networks,"Proceedings of 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2012 ASE/IEEE International Conference on Social Computing (SocialCom/PASSAT 2012)",2012,2012,"Identification of social influence in observational data is a difficult task. Endogeneity issues such as homophily, correlated unobservables and simultaneity raise challenges to the researchers interested in establishing causality and in consistently measuring its magnitude. In this paper we apply randomization techniques to identify social influence in a mobile network setting. Randomization methods consist in generating pseudo-samples of the original data by selectively permuting the values of some variables among observations, and estimating empirical distributions of a parameter of interest under the null hypothesis that such permutations are random. We show that randomization methods are a viable strategy to identify social influence in contexts where all adoption is observed and the date of adoption is available. Furthermore, we show that these methods provide a lower bound for the magnitude of the effect of peer influence. We use a comprehensive panel of data from a large European mobile carrier in one country. The data comprise Call Detailed Records for all the subscribers in this carrier for a period of 11 months. We also have information on pricing plans, adoption of products, promotions and handsets. We estimate the effect of peer influence in six of these promotions. We provide evidence for negative peer influence in their adoption. Peer influence reduces adoption for these promotions between 3% and 9%. Peer influence helps to share information about new promotions but also signals who has already adopted them and, in many cases, such as free calls, having neighbors who adopted the promotion is enough to benefit from it.",
Social Learning with Bounded Confidence and Uninformed Agents,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 31ST CHINESE CONTROL CONFERENCE,2012,2012,"This paper investigates a learning model in social networks with bounded confidence and uninformed agents. The neighboring relationships of agents are shaped by homophily in beliefs, which means any pair of agents are neighbors only if their belief difference is not larger than a positive constant, called bound of confidence. We consider two different kinds of agents: informed agents and uninformed agents, the essential difference between which is that informed agents are able to observe outside signals which can reflect the underlying true state. They update beliefs through Bayesian inference based on private signals plus consensus algorithm based on the beliefs of neighbors. Uninformed agents update their beliefs just by consensus algorithm without any inference. We find that the whole group can learn the true state only if the bound of confidence is larger than a positive threshold, which is related to the population density. Furthermore, we reveal that the larger the population density the smaller the proportion of informed agents needed to guide the group. By tuning the learning speed of informed agents, we find that the higher the speed, on the one hand, the shorter the time needed for the whole group to achieve steady state, but on the other hand, the lower the proportion of agents with successful learning, which is a trade-off.",
Does Homophily Predict Consensus Times? Testing a Model of Network Structure via a Dynamic Process,REVIEW OF NETWORK ECONOMICS,2012,2012,"We test theoretical results from Golub and Jackson (2012a), which are based on a random network model, regarding time to convergence of a learning/behavior-updating process. In particular, we see how well those theoretical results match the process when it is simulated on empirically observed high school friendship networks. This tests whether a parsimonious random network model mimics real-world networks with regard to predicting properties of a class of behavioral processes. It also tests whether our theoretical predictions for asymptotically large societies are accurate when applied to populations ranging from thirty to three thousand individuals. We find that the theoretical results account for more than half of the variation in convergence times on the real networks. We conclude that a simple multi-type random network model with types defined by simple observable attributes (age, sex, race) captures aspects of real networks that are relevant for a class of iterated updating processes.",
User and Carer Experiences of International Social Care Workers in England: Listening to their Accounts of Choice and Control,AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL WORK,2012,2012,"This paper develops a typology of people using social care services' preferences for care workers and satisfaction with social care services from a large multimethod study that explored international recruitment to the English social care sector (home and health care, including residential homes). We developed this typology with two questions in mind: (a) what led to satisfaction of care and (b) what led to preference and satisfaction with workers? Data were collected from face-to-face interviews with 35 people who were using social care services and carers (2007-2009) and these data were used to develop the typology. Using the theoretical concept of homophily, we explored contentions that people might prefer to receive care and support from individuals resembling themselves. We observed that preferences for care workers and satisfaction with social care services may be linked, but highlighted that the concept of meeting a preference is personal to the individual. The implications of users' preferences for certain care workers at a time where policy is promoting greater consumer-led care or self-directed support are discussed.",
Social Learning with Bounded Confidence,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH WORLD CONGRESS ON INTELLIGENT CONTROL AND AUTOMATION (WCICA 2012),2012,2012,"Motivated by the homophily principle in social networks, this paper investigates a social learning model with bounded confidence, in which two individuals are neighbors only if the difference of their beliefs is not larger than a constant called bound of confidence. Each individual updates her belief through Bayesian inference based on her private signal plus consensus algorithm based on the beliefs of her neighbors. We find that the whole group can learning the true state only if the bound of confidence is larger than a positive threshold, which implies that people should try to communicate with others whose beliefs are quite different with themselves, in addition to those similar to themselves. Furthermore, we introduce a neighborhood-preserved strategy to guarantee that once two individuals are neighbors they will be neighbors forever. We show that social learning in the revised model can be realized with much smaller threshold, and therefore, provide an effective mechanism for social learning.",
The Consequences of the Internet for Politics,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, VOL 15",2012,2012,"Political scientists are only now beginning to come to terms with the importance of the Internet to politics. The most promising way to study the Internet is to look at the role that causal mechanisms such as the lowering of transaction costs, homophilous sorting, and preference falsification play in intermediating between specific aspects of the Internet and political outcomes. This will allow scholars to disentangle the relevant causal relationships and contribute to important present debates over whether the Internet exacerbates polarization in the United States, and whether social media helped pave the way toward the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Over time, ever fewer political scientists are likely to study the Internet as such, as it becomes more and more a part of everyday political life. However, integrating the Internet's effects with present debates over politics, and taking proper advantage of the extraordinary data that it can provide, requires good causal arguments and attention to their underlying mechanisms.",
Network Effects and Social Inequality,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY, VOL 38",2012,2012,"Students of social inequality have noted the presence of mechanisms militating toward cumulative advantage and increasing inequality. Social scientists have established that individuals' choices are influenced by those of their network peers in many social domains. We suggest that the ubiquity of network effects and tendencies toward cumulative advantage are related. Inequality is exacerbated when effects of individual differences are multiplied by social networks: when persons must decide whether to adopt beneficial practices; when network externalities, social learning, or normative pressures influence adoption decisions; and when networks are homophilous with respect to individual characteristics that predict such decisions. We review evidence from literatures on network effects on technology, labor markets, education, demography, and health; identify several mechanisms through which networks may generate higher levels of inequality than one would expect based on differences in initial endowments alone; consider cases in which network effects may ameliorate inequality; and describe research priorities.",
Interorganizational Collaboration Networks in Economic Development Policy: An Exponential Random Graph Model Analysis,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,2012,2012,"Regional economic development competition can be inefficient and destructive because decisions by one governmental unit can impose both externalities on its neighbors. Collaborative networks of multiple stakeholders within and across jurisdictions are an increasingly crucial component of regional economic development. In this article, we focus on the emergence of voluntary and self-organizing network relationships among local governments to address economic development concerns. The motivations and decisions of local actors play a critical role in shaping and implementing regional collaboration. On a micro level, the collaboration choices are shaped by three primary factors: the transaction costs reflected in the configuration of relationships in which an actor is embedded; the organizational similarities (homophily); and the resource dependencies that shape the local actors' preferences for forming relationships with other specific actors. We utilize an exponential random graph model (ERGM) to test hypotheses regarding the most prominent observed patterns of network relationships within and across different organizational sectors. The results demonstrate that both reciprocity and social clustering structures are preferred by both government and nongovernment organizations. These results suggest that interorganizational collaboration for economic development requires more than simple exchange relationships. Rather, network actors may be better served by participating in a densely clustered network that is capable of maintaining credible commitments to collective solutions.",
SENDING AN SOS: HOW SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF BLACK LESBIANS AT PREDOMINANTLY WHITE INSTITUTIONS,BLACK FEMALE UNDERGRADUATES ON CAMPUS: SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES,2012,2012,"Little is known about the college experiences of Black lesbians at predominantly White institutions (PWIs). The purpose of our study was to explore the social support systems that these students develop in order to be successful. Six women consented to interviews that lasted 45-60 minutes. The results indicate that there are three primary sources of support on campus support, off campus support, and family. With regards to on and off campus support, our participants mostly turned to friends to emotional and appraisal support, family for instrumental support, and campus administrators, faculty, and organizations for informational support. The research also indicated that the women's support networks could be characterized by a great degree of multiplexity and homophily. We conclude the article with recommendations for policy and future research.",

Exponential-family random graph models for valued networks,ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS,2012,2012,"Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) provide a principled and flexible way to model and simulate features common in social networks, such as propensities for homophily, mutuality, and friend-of-a-friend triad closure, through choice of model terms (sufficient statistics). However, those ERGMs modeling the more complex features have, to date, been limited to binary data: presence or absence of ties. Thus, analysis of valued networks, such as those where counts, measurements, or ranks are observed, has necessitated dichotomizing them, losing information and introducing biases.In this work, we generalize ERGMs to valued networks. Focusing on modeling counts, we formulate an ERGM for networks whose ties are counts and discuss issues that arise when moving beyond the binary case. We introduce model terms that generalize and model common social network features for such data and apply these methods to a network dataset whose values are counts of interactions.",
Message Expression Effects in Online Social Communication,JOURNAL OF BROADCASTING & ELECTRONIC MEDIA,2012,2012,"Framed within the O-S-R-O-R (Orientations-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientations-Response) communication mediation framework, this study examines the bidirectional effects of personal message expression on individuals' cognitive elaboration, message learning, and attitudes when exposed to social campaign messages in blogs (anti-drunk driving). Findings from an online-based experiment, expression of personal message (yes and no), and perceived homophily to message audiences (yes and no) revealed that expressing personal messages significantly affects the amount of cognitive effort expended by individuals and message learnt, but only slightly affects their attitudes. The role of perceived homophily varies; significantly affecting cognitive effort but with no significant effects on learning and attitude. Findings show that even though influence on individual attitudes is insignificant, simultaneously receiving and expressing a message online as compared to being mere receivers of messages may impact thinking and learning of the message, at the least.",
Religiosity of Adolescents and their Friends and Network Associates: Homophily and Associations With Antisocial Behavior,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE,2012,2012,"This study assessed the similarity of adolescents and their friends and peer network associates in religiosity and the extent to which these relationships were associated with antisocial behavior. The sample included 1010 Indonesian (480 male, 530 female) 8th (13.37 similar to years) and 10th grade (15.36 similar to years) students. Adolescents were similar to their mutual friends and network associates (identified using Social Cognitive Mapping) in religiosity, and the religiosity of both friends and network associates added to male adolescents' self-religiosity in predicting antisocial behavior; these effects were not present for girls. Peers may associate with others similar to themselves in religiosity and these associations may partially explain why religious boys exhibit low levels of aggressive behavior.",
"Networking in environmental movement organisation coalitions: interest, values or discourse?",ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS,2012,2012,"Networks of information and resource exchanges between social movement organisations (SMOs) have a dual function. Such networks can support instrumental alliances among very distinct and weakly connected SMOs, but they often support the formation of more tightly-knit social movement and SMO discourse coalitions. What distinguishes an instrumental from a more substantive alliance is the density of networking. The coalescing force in dense networks is not necessarily a collective identity, but the similarity in values (value homophily) or a shared discourse. Evidence from Indonesian environmental activism is used to draw three propositions on networking, value homophily and discursive practices in coalition work: networks tend to be most dense among environmental SMOs that share the same variety of environmentalism; density of interaction in SMO discourse coalitions reveals ongoing framing activities; and environmental SMO discourse coalitions bridge across SMOs with distinct yet compatible environmental values.",

Partner Similarity and Syndicate Formation: Evidence Related to the Korean IPO Market,Journal of Business Research,2012,2012,"This paper examines how syndicates of initial public offerings (IPOs) are formed in the Korean market from the view of similarity-based associations by studying IPOs from 2002 and 2008. The results indicate that book managers are inclined to invite underwriters who have similar reputations and statuses as syndicate members, suggesting that similarity-based homophily among underwriters plays a role in forming the syndicates in the Korean IPO market. Furthermore, book managers with a high reputation and status are less likely to invite other underwriters whereas potential underwriters of high status are more likely to be invited in the syndicate. The syndicate formation of IPOs in the Korean market is also affected by existing ties among underwriters, the industry’s market volatility, and issuing firms’uncertainty.",
The Mediating Role of Flow Experience in Survival Audion Program Viewing,Korean Journal of Broadcasting and Telecommunication Studies,2012,2012,"In the current study, we examine the relation between TV watching and flow experience. We focused on the fact that recent TV viewing is becoming an active behavior with the addition of viewer involvement activities such as SMS vote. We hypothesized that SMS voting, perceived homophily of participants, and perceived fairness of the program would influence the flow experience and that flow would result in viewing satisfaction of survival audition programs. We tested our hypotheses with a survey in which 215 college students with watching experience of survival audition programs participated. Results supported all the hypotheses meaning that TV viewers could experience flow which leads to satisfaction. Although many scholars have believed that TV watching seldom causes flow experience, the results of the current study indicate that TV viewers do experience flow. We believe that more research is needed to explore influential factors involved in the flow experience process.",
SOME DETERMINANTS OF PEER VIOLENCE IN ADOLESCENCE,LJETOPIS SOCIJALNOG RADA,2012,2012,"The article first defines the notion of violence among children and young persons, presents types of violence and the characteristics of individual roles in violent behavior. Then, the period of adolescence when young people undergo many physical, biological, emotional and psychological changes is described. Also, peer influence on an adolescent is described in detail due to its great importance in that period when attitudes and thoughts defining the person in an adult age are formed. The beginning of separation from parents in the search for own identity and autonomy as well as formation of closer relationships with young people outside the family environment with which they can identify, i.e. their peers who become an important factor in adolescents' socialization and a source of support, represent important elements in this process. Peer violence in the adolescence period has certain specific characteristics, such as passage from elementary to middle school in early adolescence and from middle to high school in later phases of adolescent maturation. Violent behavior mostly does not occur in isolated conditions in presence of only a victim and a violator but in front of an auditorium of children in different roles whereby peers have a significant influence on the behavior of actors in the violence among children and young people. The article presents theories which explain in detail the role of other peers in violence among young people: dominance theory, attraction theory and homophily hypothesis. The conclusion provides certain suggestions which could be useful for future research of violence in this age group.",

Exploring Factors Affecting the Persistence of College Students' Interpersonal Relationship and the Amount of Communication,Speech & Communication,2012,2012,"In the current study, we examine which interpersonal relations persist and how much they talk to each other in face to face and through mobile phones. For that purpose, we surveyed 65 college students taking the same class at the beginning of a semester and at the end of the semester in which we measured their interpersonal relationships and their relational characteristics. It was find that the reciprocity of relations and the amount of self-disclosure significantly affected the persistence of the relations. The amount of conversation in face to face was influenced by the reciprocity of relation, homophily, and relational satisfaction whereas the amount of conversation through mobile phones was influenced by intersexual relations, partner’s self-disclosure, and relational satisfaction.",
Perceived Homophily by the Degree of Self Disclosure among SNS Users,The Journal of the Korea Contents Association,2012,2012,"This study examines perceived homophily by the degree of self disclosure among SNS users. In this research, there were three different groups in terms of the degree of self disclosure among SNS users such as strong, medium and weak self disclosure groups The major results are as follows: Firstly, the higher the degree of self disclosure, the more social network service use. In addition, the higher the degree of self disclosure, the smaller the degree of online activity including blog and mini web page. Secondly, the higher the degree of self disclosure, the higher the degree of socio-demographic homophily. It can be argued that the strong group had much more mean scores than that of medium and weak groups in terms of regions, gender, age and vocation except nationality. Also, the higher the degree of self disclosure, the higher the degree of shared homophily except of political opinion homophily.",
Clustering drives assortativity and community structure in ensembles of networks,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Dec 20 2011,2011,"Clustering, assortativity, and communities are key features of complex networks. We probe dependencies between these features and find that ensembles of networks with high clustering display both high assortativity by degree and prominent community structure, while ensembles with high assortativity show much less enhancement of the clustering or community structure. Further, clustering can amplify a small homophilic bias for trait assortativity in network ensembles. This marked asymmetry suggests that transitivity could play a larger role than homophily in determining the structure of many complex networks.",
Network Homophily and the Evolution of the Pay-It-Forward Reciprocity,PLOS ONE,Dec 15 2011,2011,"The pay-it-forward reciprocity is a type of cooperative behavior that people who have benefited from others return favors to third parties other than the benefactors, thus pushing forward a cascade of kindness. The phenomenon of the pay-it-forward reciprocity is ubiquitous, yet how it evolves to be part of human sociality has not been fully understood. We develop an evolutionary dynamics model to investigate how network homophily influences the evolution of the pay-it-forward reciprocity. Manipulating the extent to which actors carrying the same behavioral trait are linked in networks, the computer simulation model shows that strong network homophily helps consolidate the adaptive advantage of cooperation, yet introducing some heterophily to the formation of network helps advance cooperation's scale further. Our model enriches the literature of inclusive fitness theory by demonstrating the conditions under which cooperation or reciprocity can be selected for in evolution when social interaction is not confined exclusively to relatives.",
An Experimental Study of Homophily in the Adoption of Health Behavior,SCIENCE,Dec 2 2011,2011,"How does the composition of a population affect the adoption of health behaviors and innovations? Homophily-similarity of social contacts-can increase dyadic-level influence, but it can also force less healthy individuals to interact primarily with one another, thereby excluding them from interactions with healthier, more influential, early adopters. As a result, an important network-level effect of homophily is that the people who are most in need of a health innovation may be among the least likely to adopt it. Despite the importance of this thesis, confounding factors in observational data have made it difficult to test empirically. We report results from a controlled experimental study on the spread of a health innovation through fixed social networks in which the level of homophily was independently varied. We found that homophily significantly increased overall adoption of a new health behavior, especially among those most in need of it.",
Local Convergence and Global Diversity: From Interpersonal to Social Influence,JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION,Dec 2011,2011,"How can minority cultures resist assimilation into a global monolith in an increasingly ""small world""? Paradoxically, Axelrod found that local convergence can actually preserve global diversity if cultural influence is combined with homophily, the principle that ""likes attract."" However, follow-up studies showed that this diversity collapses under random cultural perturbation. The authors discovered a new source of this fragility-the assumption in Axelrod's model that cultural influence is interpersonal (dyadic). The authors replicated previous models but with the more empirically plausible assumption that influence is social-people can be simultaneously influenced by several network neighbors. Computational experiments show that cultural diversity then becomes much more robust than in Axelrod's original model or in published variations that included either social influence or homophily but not both. The authors conclude that global diversity may be sustained not by cultural experimentation and innovation but by the ability of cultural groups to discourage those activities.",
Dynamic social networks promote cooperation in experiments with humans,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Nov 29 2011,2011,"Human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized. Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic, changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in supporting large- scale human cooperation.",
Leaving us in tiers: can homophily be used to generate tiering effects?,COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ORGANIZATION THEORY,Nov 2011,2011,"Substantial evidence indicates that our social networks are divided into tiers in which people have a few very close social support group, a larger set of friends, and a much larger number of relatively distant acquaintances. Because homophily-the principle that like seeks like-has been suggested as a mechanism by which people interact, it may also provide a mechanism that generates such frequencies and distributions. However, our multi-agent simulation tool, Construct, suggests that a slight supplement to a knowledge homophily model-the inclusion of several highly salient personal facts that are infrequently shared-can more successfully lead to the tiering behavior often observed in human networks than a simplistic homophily model. Our findings imply that homophily on both general and personal facts is necessary in order to achieve realistic frequencies of interaction and distributions of interaction partners. Implications of the model are discussed, and recommendations are provided for simulation designers seeking to use homophily models to explain human interaction patterns.",

Similarity in Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents' Friendship Dyads: Selection or Socialization?,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2011,2011,"This study examined friendship selection and socialization as mechanisms explaining similarity in depressive symptoms in adolescent same-gender best friend dyads. The sample consisted of 1,752 adolescents (51% male) ages 12-16 years (M = 13.77, SD = 0.73) forming 487 friend dyads and 389 nonfriend dyads (the nonfriend dyads served as a comparison group). To test our hypothesis, we applied a multigroup actor-partner interdependence model to 3 friendship types that started and ended at different time points during the 2 waves of data collection. Results showed that adolescents reported levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up that were similar to those of their best friends. Socialization processes explained the increase in similarity exclusively in female dyads, whereas no evidence for friendship selection emerged for either male or female dyads. Additional analyses revealed that similarity between friends was particularly evident in the actual best friend dyads (i.e., true best friends), in which evidence for socialization processes emerged for both female and male friend dyads. Findings highlight the importance of examining friendship relations as a potential context for the development of depressive symptoms.",
Social Effects on Customer Retention,JOURNAL OF MARKETING,Nov 2011,2011,"This study explores the role of customers' social network in their defection from a service provider. The authors use data on communication among one million customers of a cellular company to create a large-scale social system composed of customers' individual social networks. The study's results indicate that exposure to a defecting neighbor is associated with an increase of 80% in the defection hazard, after controlling for a host of social, personal, and purchase-related variables. This effect is comparable in both magnitude and nature to social effects observed in the highly researched case of product adoption: The extent of social influence on retention decays exponentially over time, and the likelihood of defection is affected by tie strength and homophily with defecting neighbors and by these neighbors' average number of connections. Highly connected customers are more affected, and loyal customers are less affected by defections that occur in their social networks. These results carry important implications for the theoretical understanding of the drivers of customer retention and should be considered by firms that aim to predict and affect customer retention.",
"Homofilia, Selección e Influencia en un Estudio Longitudinal de Drogas en Población Escolar",Psykhe (Santiago),2011-11,2011,"This study seeks to establish levels of peer homogeneity -sometimes called homophily in the literature- in the use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana in friendship relations in early adolescence. Longitudinal data from a representative sample of school population of the Metropolitan Region of Chile was used to identify friendship dyads between students in 7th and 8th grades. Additionally, some estimates about the origin of the observed homophily are provided, as a result of selection processes in which similarity precedes friendship or, alternatively, as a result of influence processes where friendship leads to matching pairs. The results show that initiation into drugs takes place in environments that are moderately homogeneous and that influence effects are more important than selection effects.",
Network influence and organizational performance: The effects of tie strength and structural equivalence,EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Oct 2011,2011,"We combine theory and empirical evidence to develop and test three related claims about how ties strength and structural equivalence affect interorganizational performance similarity. First, network partners attain similar levels of performance because direct network ties facilitate information and resource sharing, and the diffusion of organizational practices. Organizations occupying similar network positions attain similar levels of performance because they face similar competitive constraints. Second, because mechanisms underlying performance similarity implied by direct network ties and similarity in network positions are different, strength of network ties and network position affect different dimensions of organizational performance. Third, we expect that tie strength will affect aspects of performance that are more likely to be influenced by processes activated by the direct contact between network partners. We expect structural equivalence to affect more strongly those aspects of organizational performance that are more directly influenced by competition. An analysis of interorganizational networks and organizational performance within a regional community of hospitals provides evidence in support of these claims. Models estimated on a sample of 8190 interorganizational dyads suggest that the effects of tie strength and structural equivalence on organizational performance are highly differentiated and contingent on specific aspects of performance. We show that these conclusions are robust with respect to a wide variety of other factors that may be responsible for performance similarity including competitive interdependence, structural homophily, and resource complementarity.

Media Attention as the Outcome of a Diffusion Process-A Theoretical Framework and Cross-National Evidence on Earthquake Coverage,EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Oct 2011,2011,"Research on media attention has identified a range of factors that determine whether events are covered as news. However, these determinants have been derived mainly inductively and there is a great variety in their nature and number from one study to the next, partly depending on the type of news events studied. This insufficient theoretical grounding limits the possibilities for research on media attention to connect to wider social-science theorizing. We propose a unifying theoretical framework for studying media attention, which draws on theoretical concepts and research findings from the sociological literature on the diffusion of innovations. Following Rogers' suggestion to see news as a particular type of social innovation, we derive five factors that influence news diffusion from the source location of an event to an adopting medium: event characteristics, homophily between source and adopter, network ties between source and adopter, the power and status of the source, and selective exposure to similar events or to events from the same source. We apply and test this theoretical framework by analysing the coverage of > 1,300 earthquakes in the period 1990-2005 in American, British and Dutch newspapers. Our results strongly and consistently support the theoretical expectations.",
Bringing Managers Back In: Managerial Influences on Workplace Inequality,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Oct 2011,2011,"While great progress has been made in documenting that organizational practices affect workplace inequality, little is known about how managers in particular may shape the careers of the employees below them. Using unique longitudinal personnel data on managers and their subordinates, this study identifies and tests for evidence of three distinct mechanisms by which managers potentially influence the assessment of employee performance in the workplace: (1) social network influence between employees' current and former managers; (2) manager-manager (horizontal) homophily; and (3) manager-employee (vertical) homophily. I find evidence of the independent effects of all three mechanisms of managerial influence on the outcome of disagreement in the performance evaluation ratings of the same worker between former and current managers. In particular, my results stress that both managerial network influence and horizontal homophily affect the process of employee performance assessments, over and above the well-studied vertical homophily mechanism. I conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings for future research regarding the interactional aspects of workplace inequality within contemporary organizations.",
Misery Does Not Love Company: Network Selection Mechanisms and Depression Homophily,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Oct 2011,2011,"Conventional wisdom holds that friends protect against depression through the social support they provide; however, depression likely has a role in structuring friendship networks. In particular, we investigate friend selection mechanisms responsible for similarity in depression among friends (i.e., homophily). Preference is one explanation, yet several correlates of depression make homophilous selection among depressed individuals unlikely. We propose two alternative mechanisms-avoidance and withdrawal-that can produce depression homophily in the absence of preference. These alternative mechanisms create homophily indirectly by limiting friendship partners available to depressed individuals. We test the preference, avoidance, and withdrawal mechanisms using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a dynamic network model. Results provide support for the withdrawal mechanism. These findings help explain how depression affects friend selection and have broader implications for understanding selection mechanisms responsible for network patterns such as homophily.",
Homophily and Contagion as Explanations for Weight Similarities Among Adolescent Friends,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH,Oct 2011,2011,"Purpose: To determine whether weight-based similarities among adolescent friends result from social influence processes, after controlling for the role of weight on friendship selection and other confounding influences.Methods: Four waves of data were collected from a grade 8 cohort of adolescents (N = 156, mean age = 13.6 years) over their initial 2 years of high school. At each wave, participants reported on their friendship relations with grade-mates and had their height and weight measured by researchers to calculate their body mass index (BMI). Newly developed stochastic actor-oriented models for social networks were used to simultaneously assess the role of weight on adolescents' friendship choices, and the effect of friends' BMIs on changes in adolescent BMI.Results: Adolescents' BMIs were not significantly predicted by the BMI of their friends over the 16 months of this study. Similarities in the weights of friends were found to be driven predominantly by friendship selection, whereby adolescents, particularly those who were not overweight, preferred to initiate friendships with peers whose weight status (overweight/nonoverweight) was the same as their own.Conclusions: Weight-based similarities among friends were largely explained by the marginalization of overweight adolescents by their peers, rather than by the ""contagion"" of excess weight among friends. These findings highlight the importance of adequately modeling friendship selection processes when estimating social influence effects on adiposity.

Community structure and patterns of scientific collaboration in Business and Management,SCIENTOMETRICS,Oct 2011,2011,"This paper investigates the role of homophily and focus constraint in shaping collaborative scientific research. First, homophily structures collaboration when scientists adhere to a norm of exclusivity in selecting similar partners at a higher rate than dissimilar ones. Two dimensions on which similarity between scientists can be assessed are their research specialties and status positions. Second, focus constraint shapes collaboration when connections among scientists depend on opportunities for social contact. Constraint comes in two forms, depending on whether it originates in institutional or geographic space. Institutional constraint refers to the tendency of scientists to select collaborators within rather than across institutional boundaries. Geographic constraint is the principle that, when collaborations span different institutions, they are more likely to involve scientists that are geographically co-located than dispersed. To study homophily and focus constraint, the paper will argue in favour of an idea of collaboration that moves beyond formal co-authorship to include also other forms of informal intellectual exchange that do not translate into the publication of joint work. A community-detection algorithm for formalising this perspective will be proposed and applied to the co-authorship network of the scientists that submitted to the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise in Business and Management in the UK. While results only partially support research-based homophily, they indicate that scientists use status positions for discriminating between potential partners by selecting collaborators from institutions with a rating similar to their own. Strong support is provided in favour of institutional and geographic constraints. Scientists tend to forge intra-institutional collaborations; yet, when they seek collaborators outside their own institutions, they tend to select those who are in geographic proximity. The implications of this analysis for tie creation in joint scientific endeavours are discussed.",
Homophily in stable and unstable adolescent friendships: Similarity breeds constancy,PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES,Oct 2011,2011,"This study examines homophily among adolescent friends. Participants were drawn from a community-based sample of Swedish youth who ranged from 11 to 18 years old. A total of 436 girls and 338 boys identified their closest friends and described their own delinquent activities, intoxication frequency, achievement motivation, and self-worth. Correlations and difference scores describe similarity between reciprocally nominated friends on each dimension. Adolescents who remained friends from one year to the next tended to be more similar than those who did not, during the friendship and, to a lesser extent, before the friendship. Comparisons with random pairs of same-age peers revealed that age-group homophily accounts for most of the similarity between unstable friends but only a fraction of the similarity between stable friends.

Emergence of structural patterns out of synchronization in networks with competitive interactions,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Sep 21 2011,2011,"Synchronization is a collective phenomenon occurring in systems of interacting units, and is ubiquitous in nature, society and technology. Recent studies have enlightened the important role played by the interaction topology on the emergence of synchronized states. However, most of these studies neglect that real world systems change their interaction patterns in time. Here, we analyze synchronization features in networks in which structural and dynamical features co-evolve. The feedback of the node dynamics on the interaction pattern is ruled by the competition of two mechanisms: homophily (reinforcing those interactions with other correlated units in the graph) and homeostasis (preserving the value of the input strength received by each unit). The competition between these two adaptive principles leads to the emergence of key structural properties observed in real world networks, such as modular and scale-free structures, together with a striking enhancement of local synchronization in systems with no global order.",
"BEFRIENDING THE ""OTHER"": PATTERNS OF SOCIAL TIES BETWEEN THE RELIGIOUS AND NON-RELIGIOUS",SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,FAL 2011,2011,"Aside from the literature on inter-racial and cross-sex relationships, few studies have examined the determinants of relationships that cross social boundaries. The authors contribute to this literature by considering the social boundary between the religious and the non-religious. Surveys of U.S. adults provide evidence of popular aversion toward the non-religious, but this analysis of the Baylor Religion Survey (2005) shows that the majority of religious Americans report a friendship with someone who is not religious at all. The authors find that such boundary-crossing relationships are largely structured by homophily, opportunities for intergroup contact, and religious barriers to intergroup contact. These findings reveal that some religiously themed conflicts that are common among cultural elites may not be particularly salient in the realm of daily social life.",
Measuring Information Diffusion in an Online Community,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS,FAL 2011,2011,"Measuring peer influence in social networks is an important business and policy question that has become increasingly salient with the development of globally interconnected information and communication technology networks. However, in spite of the new data sources available today, researchers still face many of the same measurement challenges that have been present in the literature for over four decades: homophily, reflection and selection problems, identifying the source of influence, and determining preexisting knowledge. The goal of this paper is to develop an empirical approach for measuring information diffusion and discovery in online social networks that have these measurement challenges. We develop such an approach and apply it to data collected from 4,000 users of an online music community. We show that peers on such networks significantly increase music discovery. Moreover, we demonstrate how future research can use this method to measure information discovery and diffusion using data from other online social networks.",
Examinations of Urban Effects on Homophily in Japan: Multilevel Analysis of Ego-Centric Network Data,SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY AND METHODS,Sep 2011,2011,"In urban sociology, C.S. Fischer has argued that urbanism promote homophily of networks. Because urbanism gives us low limitation of social relations, people choice alters who has similar characteristic. This argument is a major focus of Fischer's subcultural theory of urbanism, but only few attempts have so far been made at studying about urban effect on homophily in Japan.So I applied the multilevel model to ego-centric network data, and investigated to urban effects on homophily of four dimensions that are age, education, occupation, and hobbies. By multilevel analysis, I obtain two results. First, urban effects have not appeared in homophily of age, education, occupation. Second, urbanism promote homophily of hobbies. These results showed that homophily of hobbies is more important in Japan, and we need to reexamine subcultural theory through sharing hobbies.",
"How Do They 'End Up Together'? A Social Network Analysis of Self-Control, Homophily, and Adolescent Relationships",JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY,Sep 2011,2011,"Self-control theory (Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990) argues that individuals with similar attributes tend to 'end up together' (i.e., homophily) because of the tendency to select friends based on self-control. Studies documenting homophily in peer groups interpret the correlation between self-control, peer delinquency, and self-reported delinquency as evidence that self-control is an influential factor in friendship formation. However, past studies are limited because they do not directly test the hypothesis that self-control influences friendship selection, nor do they account for other mechanisms that may influence decisions. As a result, it is unclear whether the correlation between individual and peer behavior is the result of selection based on self-control or alternative mechanisms. To address this gap in the literature this study employs exponential random graph modeling to test hypotheses derived from self-control theory using approximately 63,000 respondents from 59 schools from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). In contrast to the predictions made by Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990), and the conclusions drawn from prior research, there is little evidence that self-control influences friendship selection. The findings are embedded in past work on the relationship between self-control and peer relationships, and implications for future research are discussed.",
"Analysis of Data Collected by RDS Among Sex Workers in 10 Brazilian Cities, 2009: Estimation of the Prevalence of HIV, Variance, and Design Effect",JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES,Aug 15 2011,2011,"Background: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a chain-referral method that is being widely used to recruit most at-risk populations. Because the method is respondent driven, observations are dependent. However, few publications have focused on methodological challenges in the analysis of data collected by RDS.Methods: In this article, we propose a method for estimating the variance of the HIV prevalence rate, based on the Markov transition probabilities and within recruitment cluster variation. The method was applied to a female commercial sex workers study carried out in 10 Brazilian cities in 2008. Both the inverse of network size and the size of the city were considered in the estimation of overall sampling weights. The study included a behavior questionnaire and rapid tests for HIV and syphilis.Results: About 2523 interviews were conducted successfully, excluding the seeds. Results show a positive homophily between recruits for those HIV+; HIV- recruiters selected HIV+ recruits 4% of the time; HIV+ recruiters selected other HIV+ recruits 19.6% of the time, about 5 times higher. The prevalence rate was estimated at 4.8% (95% confidence interval: 3.4 to 6.1), and a design effect of 2.63.Conclusions: Using statistical methods for complex sample designs, it was possible to estimate HIV prevalence, standard error, and the design effect analytically. Additionally, the proposed analysis lends itself to logistic regression, permitting multivariate models. The stratification in cities has proved suitable for reducing the effect of design and can be adopted in other RDS studies, provided the weights of the strata are known.",
Networks in the Legislative Arena: How Group Dynamics Affect Cosponsorship,LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY,Aug 2011,2011,"In this study, we explore the determinants of cosponsorship activity within state legislatures. Utilizing a social dynamic framework, we develop and test a model of the interplay of the activities of sponsorship and cosponsorship that includes both individual-level and social network characteristics as determinants of agenda-setting behavior; the latter demonstrating how collaboration and mutual interests shape the agenda-setting process. We find several consistent factors that influence the frequency of cosponsorship activity: (1) ideological distance, (2) proximity of legislators' districts, (3) homophily (similar characteristics such as race, gender, and ethnicity), and (4) transitivity (the idea that friends of my friends are also my friends).",
"Sociology of Hyperlink Networks of Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Twitter: A Case Study of South Korea",SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW,Aug 2011,2011,"This article illustrates the structural changes in hyperlink networks from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and describes Web 1.0 using hyperlink data obtained from websites of South Korean National Assembly members between 2000 and 2001. The websites were sparsely knitted and formed a hub-spike network. Hyperlinks were created to enhance the interface and navigation ability of websites. The article also examines how hyperlink patterns began to change in 2005 and 2006 when Web 2.0 (blogs) was introduced. A key difference between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 was that the Assembly members were relatively well connected in the blogosphere. Furthermore, prominent Web 1.0 hubs with many links tended to disappear, but butterfly networks based on political homophily emerged. Finally, the hyperlink network of Twitter, a recent Web 2.0 application, is examined. Twitter's network diagram shows that online social ties between politicians are becoming denser.",
Homophily and co-occurrence patterns shape randomized trials agendas: illustration in antifungal agents,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,Aug 2011,2011,"Objective: To assess whether there are preferences and avoidances for specific comparisons in a clinical trials agenda.Study Design and Setting: We tested for homophily (preference to compare agents against others in the same class) and co-occurrence (preference or avoidance of specific head-to-head comparisons) in the randomized trials agenda of antifungal agents. We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases for English language randomized trials evaluating systemic antifungals against Candida or Aspergillus in adults. We extracted data on compared regimens, sample size, publication year, indication (treatment/prophylaxis), and underlying disease.Results: One hundred forty-four trials (74 treatments, 70 prophylaxes) were found (n = 27,497 patients). Among polyene and azole groups, agents were compared within the same class more often than across classes (homophily test P < 0.001). Lipid amphotericin was compared almost entirely against conventional amphotericin (18 trials), with only three comparisons against azoles. Head-to-head comparisons of newer agents were avoided. Only one of 14 trials for echinocandins compared head-to-head two different echinocandins (P < 0.001 for co-occurrence). Of 11 trials on newer azoles, only one compared a newer azole with an echinocandin (P < 0.001 for co-occurrence).Conclusions: Trial networks for antifungals show that specific comparisons are preferred and others avoided, generating a potentially biased clinical research agenda.

Citations among blogs in a hierarchy of communities: Method and case study,JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE,Aug 2011,2011,"In this paper we propose a generic methodology to study the correlation between nodes interactions in complex networks and their organization into groups called communities. We illustrate it on citations in a blog network. We first define a homophily probability evaluating the tendency of blogs to cite blogs from the same community. We then introduce the notion of community distance to capture whether a blog cites (or is cited by) blogs distant or not from its community. We analyze the distribution of distances corresponding to each citation link, and use it to build maps of relevant communities which help interpreting blogs interactions.This community-oriented approach allows us to study citation links at various abstraction levels, and conversely, to characterize communities with regard to their citation behaviour.

Adjusting for network size and composition effects in exponential-family random graph models,STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,Jul 2011,2011,"Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) provide a principled way to model and simulate features common in human social networks, such as propensities for homophily and friend-of-a-friend triad closure. We show that, without adjustment, ERGMs preserve density as network size increases. Density invariance is often not appropriate for social networks. We suggest a simple modification based on an offset which instead preserves the mean degree and accommodates changes in network composition asymptotically. We demonstrate that this approach allows ERGMs to be applied to the important situation of egocentrically sampled data. We analyze data from the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS).

"The ""unfriending"" problem: The consequences of homophily in friendship retention for causal estimates of social influence",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2011,2011,"An increasing number of scholars are using longitudinal social network data to try to obtain estimates of peer or social influence effects. These data may provide additional statistical leverage, but they can introduce new inferential problems. In particular, while the confounding effects of homophily in friendship formation are widely appreciated, homophily in friendship retention may also confound causal estimates of social influence in longitudinal network data. We provide evidence for this claim in a Monte Carlo analysis of the statistical model used by Christakis, Fowler. and their colleagues in numerous articles estimating ""contagion"" effects in social networks. Our results indicate that homophily in friendship retention induces significant upward bias and decreased coverage levels in the Christakis and Fowler model if there is non-negligible friendship attrition over time.

Adolescents' and emerging adults' social networking online: Homophily or diversity?,JOURNAL OF APPLIED DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,JUL-AUG 2011,2011,"More than half of all online American adolescents and emerging adults have created personal profiles for social networking on the Internet. Does homophily in their offline friendships extend online? Drawing mainly on research of face-to-face friendship, we collected data from the public spaces, called ""walls"", of 129 young Americans ages 16 to 19 with active MySpace profiles to test several hypotheses concerning number of online social interactions and whether characteristics of online ""friends"" are similar to or different from characteristics of young social networkers. Number of listed friends and comments ranged widely. Most interactions were with females and with persons of the same ethnicity, age, and state, although ethnic differences and diversity were sometimes indicated. Adolescents showed greater age homophily than emerging adults, and females received a greater proportion of comments than males from same-gender friends. Possible implications of the slight majority of interactions with similar others are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
"Use of respondent-driven sampling to enhance understanding of injecting networks: A study of people who inject drugs in Sydney, Australia",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY,Jul 2011,2011,"Background: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a method for recruiting hidden populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID). In RDS, participants recruit their peers into the study; who recruited who into the study is tracked, and thus information is gathered on the population's social networks. The purpose of this study was to use information collected from an RDS study of PWID to determine the size and structure of injecting networks and whether network characteristics are associated with sharing injecting equipment.Methods: A study was launched in Sydney, Australia in 2009 with five seeds, who were asked to recruit three participants each into the survey. This process was repeated until the target sample size was reached. The median size of injecting networks and the homophily (a measure of in-group affiliation) of different subgroups were calculated. Participants' information was linked with that of their recruiter to form dyads, and multivariate analysis was conducted to determine whether dyad and injecting network characteristics were associated with sharing injecting equipment within the dyads.Results: The injecting networks were large, the lowest median subgroup network size being 12. Homophily estimates indicated a lack of strong ties both within and across groups. In the multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with sharing injecting equipment within dyads were feeling very close to their recruiter and having one or both members of the dyad identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and one or both members having not been tested for hepatitis C in the previous year.Conclusion: RDS provided valuable information on injecting networks in Sydney. PWID were shown to be socially connected with a large number of other injectors, and affiliations were formed without regard to demographic or drug use characteristics. Linking information from the recruits with that of their recruiter was a useful way of organizing information to gain a more complete understanding of risk behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Close Encounters: Analyzing How Social Similarity and Propinquity Contribute to Strong Network Connections,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,JUL-AUG 2011,2011,"Models of network formation emphasize the importance of social similarity and propinquity in producing strong interpersonal connections. The positive effect each factor can have on tie strength has been documented across a number of studies, and yet we know surprisingly very little about how the two factors combine to produce strong ties. Being in close proximity could either amplify or dampen the positive effect that social similarity can have on tie strength. Data on tie strength among teachers working in five public schools were analyzed to shed light on this theoretical question. The empirical results indicate that teachers who were similar in age were more likely to be connected by a strong tie, especially teachers for whom age similarity was more likely to be salient. Moreover, teachers who took breaks at the same time or who had classrooms on the same floor communicated more frequently and felt more emotionally attached. Among the public school teachers, propinquity amplified the positive effect that age similarity had on tie strength. The strongest network connections occurred among age-similar teachers who had classrooms on the same floor. The empirical results illustrate the value of considering how social similarity and propinquity contribute to strong ties independently and when combined with each other.",
The Contribution of Extracurricular Activities to Adolescent Friendships: New Insights Through Social Network Analysis,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Jul 2011,2011,"Extracurricular activities are settings that are theorized to help adolescents maintain existing friendships and develop new friendships. The overarching goal of the current investigation was to examine whether coparticipating in school-based extracurricular activities supported adolescents' school-based friendships. We used social network methods and data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine whether dyadic friendship ties were more likely to exist among activity coparticipants while controlling for alternative friendship processes, namely dyadic homophily (e.g., demographic and behavioral similarities) and network-level processes (e.g., triadic closure). Results provide strong evidence that activities were associated with current friendships and promoted the formation of new friendships. These associations varied based on school level (i.e., middle vs. high school) and activity type (i.e., sports, academic, arts). Results of this study provide new insight into the complex relations between activities and friendship that can inform theories of their developmental outcomes.",
Redes de apoio social no Rio de Janeiro e em São Paulo,Novos Estudos - CEBRAP,2011-07,2011,"This article analyzes egocentered networks of social support in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo using data from a survey carried out in 2008. Following the results of a previous research about personal networks in São Paulo, we investigate the main characteristics, dynamics and conditioning factors of the networks, evidencing strong regularities along the life cycle and between social groups. Regardless of those regularities, the results indicate intense relational heterogeneity inside each social group, organized both among the poor and the non-poor by the homophily and localism of the networks, generating strong consequences for the reproduction of social inequalities.",
Students' Behavioural Intentions Towards Peers with Disability,JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES,Jul 2011,2011,"BackgroundThe objectives of this study were: (i) to compare the behavioural intentions of high school students towards individuals with intellectual disabilities and individuals with physical disabilities and (ii) to explore reasons for these behavioural intentions.Materials and methodsA sample of 319 Grade 9 and Grade 12 students in Ontario, Canada, completed a questionnaire regarding their behavioural intentions towards peers with intellectual or physical disabilities. They also responded to open-ended questions concerning their feelings about participating in a class task or social activity with these individuals.ResultsBehavioural intentions towards students with intellectual disabilities were significantly more negative than were those towards students with physical disabilities. This difference was also reflected in responses to the open-ended questions. Common reasons for discomfort were perceived dissimilarities in interests or abilities.ConclusionsFuture efforts should aim to help students with and without disabilities find commonalities and to encourage reciprocity in their interactions.",
Happiness Is Assortative in Online Social Networks,ARTIFICIAL LIFE,SUM 2011,2011,"Online social networking communities may exhibit highly complex and adaptive collective behaviors. Since emotions play such an important role in human decision making, how online networks modulate human collective mood states has become a matter of considerable interest. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks, it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that the general happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), of Twitter users, as measured from a 6-month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important factor in how positive and negative sentiments are maintained and spread through human society. Future research may focus on how event-specific mood states can propagate and influence user behavior in ""real life.""",
"FACIAL RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN HETEROSEXUAL, GAY, AND LESBIAN COUPLES",PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS,Jun 2011,2011,"Researchers have noted a physical resemblance (homophily) between human sex partners. To date, these studies and their related interpretations have been based on heterosexual couples. The present study compared physical resemblances between gay, lesbian, and heterosexual couples, using 40 photographs of each from national newspapers, which were rated by 34 men and 56 women (M age =53 yr., SD =12.1). Half the photographs were of actual couples and half were randomly mixed within each group. Actual couples were rated as significantly more similar in appearance than random pairings of people. Ratings of similarity were significantly higher (indicating greater perceived homophily) for gay couples than heterosexual couples, while there was no statistically significant difference in similarity ratings between lesbian couples versus gay and heterosexual couples. The results were interpreted in terms of evolutionary and parental imprinting hypotheses.",
An agent-based model to study market penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,ENERGY POLICY,Jun 2011,2011,"A spatially explicit agent-based vehicle consumer choice model is developed to explore sensitivities and nonlinear interactions between various potential influences on plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) market penetration. The model accounts for spatial and social effects (including threshold effects, homophily, and conformity) and media influences. Preliminary simulations demonstrate how such a model could be used to identify nonlinear interactions among potential leverage points, inform policies affecting PHEV market penetration, and help identify future data collection necessary to more accurately model the system. We examine sensitivity of the model to gasoline prices, to accuracy in estimation of fuel costs, to agent willingness to adopt the PHEV technology, to PHEV purchase price and rebates, to PHEV battery range, and to heuristic values related to gasoline usage. Our simulations indicate that PHEV market penetration could be enhanced significantly by providing consumers with ready estimates of expected lifetime fuel costs associated with different vehicles (e.g., on vehicle stickers), and that increases in gasoline prices could nonlinearly magnify the impact on fleet efficiency. We also infer that a potential synergy from a gasoline tax with proceeds is used to fund research into longer-range lower-cost PHEV batteries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
A Note on the Frequency and Sources of Close Interreligious Ties,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,Jun 2011,2011,"As the religious landscape of the United States becomes increasingly diverse, understanding how individuals of different faiths relate to each other and the consequences of those relationships presents a significant issue for research. Research studying such faith-bridging interactions has been limited and primarily focused on interfaith marriage.

We then analyze how interreligious ties differ in strength from intrareligious ties.",
How Network Externalities Can Exacerbate Intergroup Inequality,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,May 2011,2011,"The authors describe a common but largely unrecognized mechanism that produces and exacerbates intergroup inequality: the diffusion of valuable practices with positive network externalities through social networks whose members differentially possess characteristics associated with adoption. The authors examine two cases: the first, to explore the mechanism's implications and, the second, to demonstrate its utility in analyzing empirical data. In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages.",
Integrated or isolated? The impact of public housing redevelopment on social network homophily,SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2011,2011,"Do mixed income housing programs increase the poor's social network diversity? Using unique, longitudinal, egocentric social network data, this research investigates changes in social network homophily for both Vietnamese and English-speaking original residents of a public housing redevelopment site. Changes in mixing occur for both those who return and those who moved away, but only increases in ethnic mixing were associated with returning to the new site. Thus, changes in social networks may be associated with disruption rather moving to a mixed-income site. Vietnamese residents also experienced increases in ethnic diversity compared to English-speaking respondents. The results raise questions about the social mixing intent of such programs. The high expectations for social network benefits of income mixing housing programs should be tempered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Scalable Inference of Customer Similarities from Interactions Data Using Dirichlet Processes,MARKETING SCIENCE,MAY-JUN 2011,2011,"Under the sociological theory of homophily, people who are similar to one another are more likely to interact with one another. Marketers often have access to data on interactions among customers from which, with homophily as a guiding principle, inferences could be made about the underlying similarities. However, larger networks face a quadratic explosion in the number of potential interactions that need to be modeled. This scalability problem renders probability models of social interactions computationally infeasible for all but the smallest networks. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for modeling customer interactions that is both grounded in the theory of homophily and is flexible enough to account for random variation in who interacts with whom. In particular, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach, using Dirichlet processes, to moderate the scalability problems that marketing researchers encounter when working with networked data. We find that this framework is a powerful way to draw insights into latent similarities of customers, and we discuss how marketers can apply these insights to segmentation and targeting activities.",
Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies,SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH,May 2011,2011,"The authors consider processes on social networks that can potentially involve three factors: homophily, or the formation of social ties due to matching individual traits; social contagion, also known as social influence; and the causal effect of an individual's covariates on his or her behavior or other measurable responses. The authors show that generically, all of these are confounded with each other. Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used (or both). In particular the authors demonstrate, with simple examples, that asymmetries in regression coefficients cannot identify causal effects and that very simple models of imitation (a form of social contagion) can produce substantial correlations between an individual's enduring traits and his or her choices, even when there is no intrinsic affinity between them. The authors also suggest some possible constructive responses to these results.",
Sensitivity Analysis for Contagion Effects in Social Networks,SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH,May 2011,2011,"Analyses of social network data have suggested that obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness all travel through social networks. Individuals exert ""contagion effects'' on one another through social ties and association. These analyses have come under critique because of the possibility that homophily from unmeasured factors may explain these statistical associations and because similar findings can be obtained when the same methodology is applied to height, acne, and headaches, for which the conclusion of contagion effects seems somewhat less plausible. The author uses sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the extent to which supposed contagion effects for obesity, smoking, happiness, and loneliness might be explained away by homophily or confounding and the extent to which the critique using analysis of data on height, acne, and headaches is relevant. Sensitivity analyses suggest that contagion effects for obesity and smoking cessation are reasonably robust to possible latent homophily or environmental confounding; those for happiness and loneliness are somewhat less so. Supposed effects for height, acne, and headaches are all easily explained away by latent homophily and confounding. The methodology that has been used in past studies for contagion effects in social networks, when used in conjunction with sensitivity analysis, may prove useful in establishing social influence for various behaviors and states. The sensitivity analysis approach can be used to address the critique of latent homophily as a possible explanation of associations interpreted as contagion effects.",
Information seeking and social support in online health communities: impact on patients' perceived empathy,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,May 2011,2011,"Objective Many healthcare organizations (HCOs) including Kaiser Permanente, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Medical Center, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, provide access to online health communities as part of their overall patient support services. The key objective in establishing and running these online health communities is to offer empathic support to patients. Patients' perceived empathy is considered to be critical in patient recovery, specifically, by enhancing patient's compliance with treatment protocols and the pace of healing. Most online health communities are characterized by two main functions: informational support and social support. This study examines the relative impact of these two distinct functions that is, as an information seeking forum and as a social support forum on patients' perceived empathy in online health communities.Design This study tests the impact of two variables that reflect the above functions of online health communities information seeking effectiveness and perceived social support on perceived empathy. The model also incorporates the potential moderating effect of homophily on these relationships.Measurements A web-based survey was used to collect data from members of the online health communities provided by three major healthcare centers. A regression technique was used to analyze the data to test the hypotheses.Results The study finds that it is the information seeking effectiveness rather than the social support which affects patient's perceived empathy in online health communities run by HCOs. The results indicate that HCOs that provide online health communities for their patients need to focus more on developing tools that will make information seeking more effective and efficient.",
Longitudinal analysis of large social networks: Estimating the effect of health traits on changes in friendship ties,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,Apr 30 2011,2011,"We develop novel mixed effects models to examine the role of health traits on the status of peoples' close friendship nominations in the Framingham Heart Study. The health traits considered are both mutable (body mass index (BMI), smoking, blood pressure, body proportion, muscularity, and depression) and, for comparison, basically immutable (height, birth order, personality type, only child, and handedness); and the traits have varying degrees of observability. We test the hypotheses that existing ties (i.e. close friendship nominations) are more likely to dissolve between people with dissimilar (mutable and observable) health traits whereas new ties are more likely to form between those with similar (mutable and observable) traits while controlling for persons' age, gender, geographic separation, and education. The mixed effects models contain random effects for both the nominator (ego) and nominated (alter) persons in a tie to account for the fact that people were involved in multiple relationships and contributed observations at multiple exams. Results for BMI support the hypotheses that people of similar BMI are less likely to dissolve existing ties and more likely to form ties, while smoker to non-smoker ties were the least likely to dissolve and smoker to smoker ties were the most likely to form. We also validated previously known findings regarding homophily on age and gender, and found evidence that homophily also depends upon geographic separation.

Who Contacts Whom? Educational Homophily in Online Mate Selection,EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Apr 2011,2011,"Data from an online dating platform are used to study the importance of education for initiating and replying to online contacts. We analyse how these patterns are influenced by educational homophily and opportunity structures. Social exchange theory and mate search theory are used to explain online mate selection behaviour. Our results show that educational homophily is the dominant mechanism in online mate choice. Similarity in education significantly increases the rate of both sending and replying to initial contacts. After controlling for the opportunity structure on the platform, the preference for similar educated others is the most important factor, particularly among women. Our results also support the exchange theoretical idea that homophily increases with educational level. If dissimilarity contacting patterns are found, women are highly reluctant to contact partners with lower educational qualifications. Men, in contrast, do not have any problems to contact lower-qualified women. Studies of educational homogamy generally show that couples where women have a higher level of education are rare. Our study demonstrates that this is mainly the result of women's reluctance to contact lower qualified men.",
Effect of Dynamics of Social Network on Culture Formation driven by Adaptation to Environmental Conditions,SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY AND METHODS,Mar 2011,2011,"This paper presents an agent based model to simulate the process of formation of culture considering the adaptation to the environmental condition and discuss the effect of dynamic change of social network.In the presented model, agents learn the information provided from the environment and agents do not simply share the information that was hold by agents at the initial state. In the diffusion process of information, agents do not simply copy other agents' state variables, but share the target of learning, which is supposed to simulate ""conditional learning"". Network is supposed to be dynamic and links are rewired based on the homophily rule. Dynamic analysis of the model is supposed to show the co-evolution process of network and culture.Simulation results reveal that several groups of culture, which are corresponding to the environmental conditions, are formed when homophilic property of network dynamics is suppressed by constraint on the link rewiring, etc. These results indicate a new mechanism of formation of polarized cultural groups in the community, society and so forth.",
Correlated genotypes in friendship networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Feb 1 2011,2011,"It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans who have similar characteristics, but it is unclear whether this tendency has consequences for the distribution of genotypes in a population. Although geneticists have shown that populations tend to stratify genetically, this process results from geographic sorting or assortative mating, and it is unknown whether genotypes may be correlated as a consequence of nonreproductive associations or other processes. Here, we study six available genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps of the friendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one genotype is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication study in an independent sample from the Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2 exhibits significant homophily and that CYP2A6 exhibits significant heterophily. These unique results show that homophily and heterophily obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, which has implications for the study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular, the results suggest that association tests should include friends' genes and that theories of evolution should take into account the fact that humans might, in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans around them.",
Condicionantes estruturais dos relacionamentos intraorganizacionais: uma análise da influência sobre relações de comunicação e decisão,RAM. Revista de Administração Mackenzie,2011-02,2011,"This paper aims to analyze the communication and decision relations making between managers established and industrial organization. Starting with conceptual issues outlined in the organization theory and social networks theories, we first assess how the formal structure determines the relations of communication and decision making. Then we evaluate how the departmental structure enacts patterns of homophily and heterophily. Finally, we evaluate how the formal aspects of the office, personal characteristics and position in the network are associated with the prestige of the managers. In the results, we stress that, between the formal relations, hierarchical relationship determines natural relations, affecting more instrumental choices (decision making) that social choices (communication). We also observed that the production department has a tendency of segregation or homophily, while other departments have a tendency of differentiation or heterophily. Finally, trying to understand the background to the reputation of managers, we identify which among the variables of networks, those that point to the formation of social capital through weak ties were more strongly related to prestige in decision making than those indicate that social capital through strong ties.",
Role of Personal Connections in Shaping Decisions About Private Forest Use in Central Massachusetts 2008,LTER Network Information System Repository,2015-08-13,2011,"We begin with a simple premise: Social and ecological systems are interconnected in complex ways. Forests are, perhaps, one of the most intriguing examples of this interconnectedness--particularly those in private ownerships.

Pervasive Sensing to Model Political Opinions in Face-to-Face Networks,PERVASIVE COMPUTING,2011,2011,"Exposure and adoption of opinions in social networks are important questions in education, business, and government. We describe a novel application of pervasive computing based on using mobile phone sensors to measure and model the face-to-face interactions and subsequent opinion changes amongst undergraduates, during the 2008 US presidential election campaign. We find that self-reported political discussants have characteristic interaction patterns and can be predicted from sensor data. Mobile features can be used to estimate unique individual exposure to different opinions, and help discover surprising patterns of dynamic homophily related to external political events, such as election debates and election day. To our knowledge, this is the first time such dynamic homophily effects have been measured. Automatically estimated exposure explains individual opinions on election day. Finally, we report statistically significant differences in the daily activities of individuals that change political opinions versus those that do not, by modeling and discovering dominant activities using topic models. We find people who decrease their interest in politics are routinely exposed (face-to-face) to friends with little or no interest in politics.",
Network Homophily and the Evolution of the Pay-It-Forward Reciprocity,Figshare,2016-01-14,2011,"The pay-it-forward reciprocity is a type of cooperative behavior that people who have benefited from others return favors to third parties other than the benefactors, thus pushing forward a cascade of kindness. The phenomenon of the pay-it-forward reciprocity is ubiquitous, yet how it evolves to be part of human sociality has not been fully understood. We develop an evolutionary dynamics model to investigate how network homophily influences the evolution of the pay-it-forward reciprocity. Manipulating the extent to which actors carrying the same behavioral trait are linked in networks, the computer simulation model shows that strong network homophily helps consolidate the adaptive advantage of cooperation, yet introducing some heterophily to the formation of network helps advance cooperation's scale further. Our model enriches the literature of inclusive fitness theory by demonstrating the conditions under which cooperation or reciprocity can be selected for in evolution when social interaction is not confined exclusively to relatives.",
Improving the Accuracy of Similarity Measures by Using Link Information,FOUNDATIONS OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS,2011,2011,"The notion of similarity is crucial to a number of tasks and methods in machine learning and data mining, including clustering and nearest neighbor classification. In many contexts, there is on the one hand a natural (but not necessarily optimal) similarity measure defined on the objects to be clustered or classified, but there is also information about which objects are linked together. This raises the question to what extent the information contained in the links can be used to obtain a more relevant similarity measure. Earlier research has already shown empirically that more accurate results can be obtained by including such link information, but it was not analyzed why this is the case. In this paper we provide such an analysis. We relate the extent to which improved results can be obtained to the notions of homophily in the network, transitivity of similarity, and content variability of objects. We explore this relationship using some randomly generated datasets, in which we vary the amount of homophily and content variability. The results show that within a fairly wide range of values for these parameters, the inclusion of link information in the similarity measure indeed yields improved results, as compared to computing the similarity of objects directly from their content.",
Building Virtual Communities on top of Online Social Networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION,2011,2011,"Current day social networks have amassed large amounts of information on how people interact, consume data and disseminate ideas. Virtual organizations, on the other hand, have crafted frameworks and models to use such data in distributed, heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of using social network technologies in support of virtual organizations. To emphasize which types of virtual organizations can benefit most from a social network based approach, we give a classification of social network relationships. Building on the work of sociologists, we focus on the cases when organization memberships can increase the benefits for members while also helping the organization to advance its cause. As a proof of concept application for our proposed solution, we created an application running on the popular social network Facebook.",
Collaboration-Based Function Prediction in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks,ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS X: IDA 2011,2011,2011,"The cellular metabolism of a living organism is among the most complex systems that man is currently trying to understand. Part of it is described by so-called protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and much effort is spent on analyzing these networks. In particular, there has been much interest in predicting certain properties of nodes in the network (in this case, proteins) from the other information in the network. In this paper, we are concerned with predicting a protein's functions. Many approaches to this problem exist. Among the approaches that predict a protein's functions purely from its environment in the network, many are based on the assumption that neighboring proteins tend to have the same functions. In this work we generalize this assumption: we assume that certain neighboring proteins tend to have ""collaborative"", but not necessarily the same, functions. We propose a few methods that work under this new assumption. These methods yield better results than those previously considered, with improvements in F-measure ranging from 3% to 17%. This shows that the commonly made assumption of homophily in the network (or ""guilt by association""), while useful, is not necessarily the best one can make. The assumption of collaborativeness is a useful generalization of it; it is operational (one can easily define methods that rely on it) and can lead to better results.",
Guild Play in MMOGs: Rethinking Common Group Dynamics Models,SOCIAL INFORMATICS,2011,2011,"Humans form groups and congregate into groups for a variety of reasons and in a variety of contexts e.g., corporations in offline space and guilds in Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs). In recent years a number of models of group formation have been proposed. One such model is Johnson et al's [10] model of group evolution. The model is motivated by commonalities observed in evolution of street gangs in Los Angeles and guilds in an MMOG (World of Warcraft). In this paper we first apply their model to guilds in another MMOG (EQ2)(1) and found results inconsistent from the model's predictions, additionally we found support for the role of homophily in guild formation, which was ruled out in previous results, Alternatively, we explore alternative models for guild formation and evolution in MMOGs by modifying earlier models to account for the existence of previous relationships between people.",
MODELING CELLULAR NETWORK TRAFFIC WITH MOBILE CALL GRAPH CONSTRAINTS,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2011 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC),2011,2011,"The design, analysis and evaluation of protocols in cellular and hybrid networks requires realistic traffic modeling, since the underlying mobility and traffic model has a significant impact on the performance. We present a unified framework involving constrained temporal graphs that incorporate a variety of spatial, homophily and call-graph constraints into the network traffic model. The specific classes of constraints include bounds on the number of calls in given spatial regions, specific homophily relations between callers and callees, and the indegree and outdegree distributions of the call graph, for the whole time duration and intervals. Our framework allows us to capture a variety of complex behavioral adaptations and study their impacts on the network traffic. We illustrate this by a case study showing the impact of different homophily relations on the spatial and temporal characteristics of network traffic as well as the structure of the call graphs.",
Statistical Models for Social Networks,"ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY, VOL 37",2011,2011,"Statistical models for social networks as dependent variables must represent the typical network dependencies between tie variables such as reciprocity, homophily, transitivity, etc. This review first treats models for single (cross-sectionally observed) networks and then for network dynamics. For single networks, the older literature concentrated on conditionally uniform models.. Various types of latent space models have been developed: for discrete, general metric, ultrametric, Euclidean, and partially ordered spaces. Exponential random graph models were proposed long ago but now are applied more and more thanks to the non-Markovian social circuit specifications that were recently proposed. Modeling network dynamics is less complicated than modeling single network observations because dependencies are spread out in time. For modeling network dynamics, continuous-time models are more fruitful. Actor-oriented models here provide a model that can represent many dependencies in a flexible way. Strong model development is now going on to combine the features of these models and to extend them to more complicated outcome spaces.",
"Global competitiveness, consumer choice and 'country of origin' effect: an exploratory East-West study",ASIA PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW,2011,2011,"As protectionist sentiments rise in many countries in light of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, it is more important than ever to understand the potential role of homophily on the country of origin (COO) effect in consumer purchases and how it can impact trade and investment. This study examines these attitudes using a sample of 139 university students from different ethnic backgrounds in Vancouver (Canada), one of the most culturally diverse cities in North America. The results confirm the importance of ethnicity in affecting attitudes toward different countries, including the impact of political/cultural ties and current/historical events on their formation. Variations among different ethnic groups were found, however.",
Design Considerations for a Social Network-Based Recommendation System (SNRS),COMMUNITY-BUILT DATABASES: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,2011,2011,"The effects of homophily among friends have demonstrated their importance to product marketing. However, it has rarely been considered in recommender systems. In this chapter, we propose a new paradigm of recommender systems which can significantly improve performance by utilizing information in social networks including user preference, item likability, and homophily. A probabilistic model, named SNRS, is developed to make personalized recommendations from such information. We extract data from a real online social network, and our analysis of this large dataset reveals that friends have a tendency to select the same items and give similar ratings. Experimental results from this dataset show that SNRS not only improves the prediction accuracy of recommender systems, but also remedies the data sparsity and cold-start issues inherent in collaborative filtering. Furthermore, we propose to improve the performance of SNRS by applying semantic filtering of social networks and validate its improvement via a class project experiment. In this experiment, we demonstrate how relevant friends can be selected for inference based on the semantics of friend relationships and finer-grained user ratings. Such technologies can be deployed by most content providers. Finally, we discuss two trust issues in recommender systems and show how SNRS can be extended to solve these problems.",
SPOTLIGHT: Distrust in democracy: complex civic networks and the case of Brazil,CONTENTION AND TRUST IN CITIES AND STATES,2011,2011,"Trust is only one of the types of ties generated by social networks, and arguably not the most important in generating access to the state. The term ""trust networks"" usually refers to social formations characterized by homophily, strong ties, and dense network clustering, which generate the identities and commitments 1 underlying mobilization and civic life. Yet the social networks literature also notes the importance of weak or ""bridging"" ties that span network enclaves and link heterogeneous and contending sets of actors. I argue that it is often distrust, rather than trust, that serves as the vehicle of integration of non-state actors into the democratic polity, via the intersection of partisan and civic engagement. When this is absent we run the risk of state-society relations characterized by clientelism, quiescence, stagnation and balkanization. Using the case of Brazil in the 1980s and 90s, I argue that a healthy democracy depends not just upon the integration of trust-based enclaves into the state - the historical source of corporatist politics - but upon complex civic and partisan networks in which contending institutional logics crosscut and inform each other. While these may generate conflict and tensions, they are also the source of the institutional innovation, contestation, and engagement with state politics that a strong and resilient democracy requires.",
Modeling Socialness in Dynamic Social Networks,2011 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS AND MINING (ASONAM 2011),2011,2011,"Socialness refers to the ability to elicit social interaction and social links among people. It is a concept often associated with individuals. Although there are tangible benefits in socialness, there is little research in its modeling. In this paper, we study socialness as a property that can be associated with items, beyond its traditional association with people. We aim to model an item's socialness as a quantitative measure based on the how popular the item is adopted by members of multiple communities. We propose two socialness models, namely Basic and Mutual Dependency, to compute item socialness based on different sets of principles. In developing the Mutual Dependency Model, we demonstrate that items' socialness can be related to the socialness of communities. Our model have been evaluated on a set of users and application items from a mobile social network. We also conducted experiments to study how socialness can be related to network effects such as homophily, social influence and friendship formation.",
Determinants of consumer engagement in electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social networking sites,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING,2011,2011,"As more and more marketers incorporate social media as an integral part of the promotional mix., rigorous investigation of the determinants that impact consumers' engagement in eWOM via social networks is becoming critical. Given the social and communal characteristics of social networking sites (SNSs) such as Faeebook, My Space and Friendster, this study examines how social relationship factors relate to eWOM transmitted via online social websites. Specifically, a conceptual model that identifies tie strength, homophily, trust, normative and informational interpersonal influence as an important antecedent to eWOM behaviour in SNSs was developed and tested. The results confirm that tie strength, trust, normative and informational influence are positively associated with users' overall eWOM behaviour, whereas a negative relationship was found with regard to homophily. This study suggests that product-focused eWOM in SNSs is a unique phenomenon with important social implications. The implications for researchers, practitioners and policy makers of social media regulation are discussed.",
Beyond Homophily: A Decade of Advances in Understanding Peer Influence Processes,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE,2011,2011,"This article reviews empirical and theoretical contributions to a multidisciplinary understanding of peer influence processes in adolescence over the past decade. Five themes of peer influence research from this decade were identified, including a broadening of the range of behaviors for which peer influence occurs, distinguishing the sources of influence, probing the conditions under which influence is amplified/attenuated (moderators), testing theoretically based models of peer influence processes (mechanisms), and preliminary exploration of behavioral neuroscience perspectives on peer influence. This review highlights advances in each of these areas, underscores gaps in current knowledge of peer influence processes, and outlines important challenges for future research.",

Exposure to violent content also led to greater physical hostility than exposure to nonviolent content. An interaction effect revealed playing a violent game with a character physically resembling the player led to even greater hostility.",
Creating Knowledge through Networks: a Gender Perspective,GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION,Jan 2011,2011,"This article offers a theoretical analysis of knowledge creation through networking, specifically drawing upon the example of female senior managers as potential knowledge creators. The article constructs a model of networks and their corresponding knowledge and organizational types. It highlights the importance of differentiating between formal and informal networks and shows that senior women have limited access to and are often excluded from strategic informal networks, such as the old boys' network. Restricted network access denies involvement in the exchange and creation of tacit knowledge and ultimately, organizational resources and power. The strength of network ties may also impact upon the quality of knowledge exchanged within networks, its level of complexity and strategic relevance. The article contributes to the debate on the gendering of the knowledge economy and suggests a theoretical approach to understanding women's inclusion and exclusion from knowledge creation in organizations.",
"Information, networks, and the complexity of trust in commons governance",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS,2011,2011,"The publication of Elinor Ostrom's (1990) Governing the Commons fueled significant theoretical and empirical progress in the field of commons governance and collective action, most notably in the form of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. A central question within this literature is how trust is created, maintained, and potentially destroyed in the context of sustainability issues. While the commons literature has provided a deeper understanding of trust, most empirical work has been done in relatively simple settings that do not capture the complexity of many global, institutionally-complex dilemmas that we face today. This paper discusses how our understanding of trust in these more complex settings may be improved by considering how two broad categories of variables - belief systems and networks - influence trust.",
Ethnic Peer Preferences Among Asian American Adolescents in Emerging Immigrant Communities,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE,2011,2011,"Growing diversity and evidence that diverse friendships enhance psychosocial success highlight the importance of understanding adolescents' ethnic peer preferences. Using social identity and social contact frameworks, the ethnic preferences of 169 Asian American adolescents (60% female) were examined in relation to ethnic identity, perceived discrimination, and language proficiency. Adolescents with same- and mixed-ethnic friends reported significantly greater ethnic centrality than those with mostly different-ethnic friends. Adolescents with same- ethnic friends reported significantly higher perceived discrimination and lower English proficiency than those with mixed- and different-ethnic friends. Open-ended responses were linked to quantitative data and provided further insight into specific influences on peer preferences (e. g., shared traditions, homophily). Results speak to the importance of cultural experiences in structuring the friendships and everyday lives of adolescents.",
The influence of peer norms and popularity on smoking and drinking behavior among college fraternity members: A social network analysis,SOCIAL INFLUENCE,2011,2011,"Previous research has found that Greek membership strongly predicts smoking and alcohol consumption. This paper examined the influence of popularity and conforming to perceived peer norms on smoking and drinking among college fraternity members using social network analysis. Social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) and diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 2003) were applied as theoretical frameworks. Results of a longitudinal study indicated that popularity significantly predicted both smoking and drinking behaviors. Strong homophily existed for smoking, but not for the number of drinks consumed per day. Smoking and drinking were significantly correlated, and diffusion of both behaviors occurred in the network over a period of time. Conforming to peer norms also mediated the effect of popularity on smoking and drinking within the peer social network. Popular members both smoked and drank more, but this occurred due to their greater likelihood of conforming to their peer group's smoking and drinking norms. Implications for future research are discussed.",
Intensification of geo-cultural homophily in global trade: Evidence from the gravity model,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Jan 2011,2011,This article extends the homophily principle (similarity breeds connection) found in many social networks to the study of global trade Using a large data set about global bilateral trade from 1950 through 2000 analyzed by the gravity model borrowed from international economics this study identifies increased geographic and cultural homophily in global trade suggesting that countries increasingly favor their geographically and culturally proximate counterparts in global trade Another analysis of bilateral trade data at the sector level produces an explanation for this observed intensification of geo-cultural homophily The technological and institutional Improvements facilitate disintegration of productive activities and product differentiation thereby intensifying geo-cultural homophily in the intermediate input and finished manufacture sectors moreover trade expansion in these geo-culturally sensitive sectors outpaces geo-culturally less sensitive sectors such as the raw material sector This differential expansion of trade across sectors shifts the composition of the overall global trade and makes it more subject to geo-cultural influences Taken together global trade has become more geo-culturally embedded Instead of eliminating geo-cultural homophily in global economic activities ironically the improved technologies provide better conditions for it to materialize and grow (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved,
Homophily Among Good Friends. Close and Weak Friendships Between Children With Migration Background and Native Peers,SOZIALE WELT-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIALWISSENSCHAFTLICHE FORSCHUNG UND PRAXIS,2011,2011,"Modifying M. Granovetters distinction between strong and weak tie friendships, social assimilation of immigrant children will be investigated from a social network perspective. Using data from primary school classes we start from the assumption that particularly close friendships have a positive impact on the process of acculturation. We investigate the role of ethnic homophily in the formation of weak and close friendships between immigrant and native children. In doing so, alternative explanations of friendship formation like social homophily as a mediator of ethnic homophily will be considered measured by similarity of ego and alter in terms of cultural capital ""in the objectified state"". As a result, immigrant children of Turkish origin have friendships with native peers, but these connections tend to be rather weak tie relations. Dyads of two Turkish children, in contrast, chances of close friendships are higher. It will be argued that these results are in line with the concept of selective acculturation of immigrant children of Turkish origin.",
Impact of Online Restaurant Information WOM Characteristics on the Effect of WOM   -Focusing on the Mediating Role of Source-Credibility-,The Korean Journal of Food and Nutrition,2011,2011,"The current research identified the impacts of WOM(Word-of-Mouth) regarding dining experience and the factors which were likely to influence them. Specifically, this study is examined from the perspective of WOM recipient's in on-line settings. For the purpose of this research, online survey was used and a total 203 online questionnaires of respondents who had experienced restaurant reviews and recommendations via internet last 6 month were analyzed. Overall, the results indicated that in aspects of WOM recipients, the impacts of WOM were ‘visit intention’, ‘re-WOM intention’ and ‘source credibility’ affected ‘WOM acceptance’ in this process. Additionally, ‘online homophily’ and ‘message vividness’ had a positive effects(p<0.001) on builiding source credibility. By clarifying the process between on-line WOM of restaurant consumers and their actual visit, this study intend to provide basis which can be used for restaurant industry's effective marketing activity.",
"Personal Network Maintenance, Face-to-Face Interaction, and Distance Role of Availability and Use of Information and Communication Technologies",TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,2011,2011,"Taking as a departing point the general agreement in the literature about the complementary role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in social activity travel, the paper focuses on the interplay between different media (face to face, telephone, Internet based) in personal network maintenance, with a special focus on the relevance of distance and socioeconomics. Through an explicit social-structure approach, social networks were conceived of as personal communication systems that people would use to stay socially connected. Using data gathered recently in Concepcion, Chile, the study focused on two neighborhoods distinctive because of their income levels. The study examined the interplay between ICT availability and use, the frequency of face-to-face interaction, and the role of distance. Quantitative methods were used to study the specific contexts in which ICT complements face-to-face interaction by identifying the role of distance and key characteristics of egos and alters and the personal networks in which they are embedded. [The author defines ""alter"" as ""social contact."" -Ed.] The results suggest that, after controlling for demographics, telephone and Internet have specialized functions, depending on the ego-alter relationship in aspects such as roles, distance, length of the relationship, and age and gender homophily. Therefore, the complementary effect of ICT in social activities is mediated by the social context in which these interactions occur and highlights the relevance of the particularities of the spatial, socioeconomic, and social structure in which social relations are embedded.",
Teachers' Decision-Making and Educational Equity: A Vignette Experiment on School Track Recommendations by Trainee Teachers,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE DER ERZIEHUNG UND SOZIALISATION,2011,2011,"So far, only little is known about the effects of teachers' socio-economic characteristics on pupils' educational opportunities. Accordingly, the study at hand explores - based on a sample of 727 trainee teachers how the impact of teacher characteristics on pupils' educational opportunities (here: the school track recommendation) can be measured by means of a factorial survey/vignette experiment. The results of multilevel-analyses show significant effects of a teacher's gender, age and level of performance (measured as his or her own school grades) on the educational opportunities of primary school pupils. Hence, pupils with similar characteristics are evaluated differently by different teachers. Moreover, it is noteworthy that a teacher's gender interacts with the gender of a pupil: male teachers evaluate boys more favourable, as do female teachers with girls (gender-homophily-effect). Overall, these results indicate that - despite discussed restrictions - the factorial survey represents a good method to uncover the structures of teachers' (and other educational agents') educational decision-making, thus contributing to the explanation of educational inequalities.",
Effectiveness of Respondent-Driven Sampling to Recruit High Risk Heterosexual Men Who Have Multiple Female Sexual Partners: Differences in HIV Prevalence and Sexual Risk Behaviours Measured at Two Time Points,AIDS AND BEHAVIOR,Dec 2010,2010,"Regular HIV bio-behavioural surveillance surveys (BBSS) among high risk heterosexual (HRH) men who have multiple female sexual partners is needed to monitor HIV prevalence and risk behaviour trends, and to improve the provision and assessment of HIV prevention strategies for this population In 2006 and 2008 we used respondent-driven sampling to recruit HRH men and examine differences in HIV prevalence and risk behaviours between the two time points In both surveys the target population had little difficulty in recruiting others from their social networks that were able to sustain the chain-referral process Key variables reached equilibrium within one to six recruitment waves and homophily indices showed neither tendencies to in-group nor out-group preferences Between 2006 and 2008 there were significant differences in condom use with main sexual partners, numbers of sexual partners, and alcohol consumption Further BBSS among this population are needed before more reliable trends can be inferred",
Evolution of Collaboration within the US Long Term Ecological Research Network,BIOSCIENCE,Dec 2010,2010,"The US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program began in 1980 with the mission of addressing long term ecological phenomena through research at individual sites as well as comparative and synthetic activities among sites We applied network science measures to assess how the LTER program has achieved its mission using intersite publications as the measure of collaboration As it grew the LTER program evolved from (a) a col lection of independent sites (1981-1984) to (b) multiple ephemerally connected groupings with a gradual increase in collaboration (1985 to about 1998) to (c) a largely collaborative, densely connected network (from approximately 1999 on) Some sites demonstrated preferential attachment by contributing more to the evolution of network cohesion than others Collaborative efforts of LTER scientists included cross-site measurements and comparisons, information technology transfer documentation of methodologies, and synthesis of ecological concepts Network science provides insights that not only document the evolution of research networks but also may be prescriptive of mechanisms to enhance this evolution",
From their perspective: explanations of patterns of racialised social interactions among a group of post-apartheid adolescents,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY,Dec 2010,2010,"We explore a group of adolescents' interpretations of patterns of racial integration and segregation at a racially integrated high school in Gauteng. The article is based on a study that was conducted in two phases. The first phase of the study, which is reported elsewhere, involved naturalistic observation of the patterns of social integration and segregation, primarily on the basis of 'race', occurring among a group of post-apartheid adolescents during 'free' time at a desegregated co-educational private high school. A dominant pattern of social self-segregation on the basis of 'race' was noted in this phase of the research. The second phase of the research, which is the focus of this article, involved a focus group discussion with eight adolescents at a different desegregated co-educational private high school. In the focus group discussion the adolescents confirmed the racialised nature of the dominant pattern of social self-segregation at the school where observations were conducted (as reflected to them in a set of photographs) as well as in their own social experiences. Their explanations and justifications for self-segregation reflected a range of contradictions and included the racialisation of interests, the naturalisation of segregation, homophily, socialisation, and the avoidance of conflict or threat. The numerous contradictions noted in the participants' explanations as well as their use of various psychological defences and positive self-presentation strategies highlighted the highly complex affective nature of intergroup relations and the manifest dilemmas characterising their social experiences and everyday realities.",
Hanging out: Features of urban children's peer social networks,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,Nov 2010,2010,"This paper explores associations between two demographic characteristics (i.e., sex and grade level) and the peer network features (i.e., size, density, and demographic homophily) of 144 third through eighth grade students (ages 8-15) in an urban, US elementary school with considerable diversity in race and socioeconomic status. The results offer only partial support for the two cultures theory, as sex differences in network size attenuated with increasing grade levels. The findings also highlight developmental trends, including a curvilinear effect of grade on network density and grade-level increases in cross-sex and same-race relationships. Finally, the paper includes a discussion of the importance of opportunity structures for, and the joint consideration of sex and developmental influences on, children's peer social networks.",
Relational mechanisms governing multifaceted collaborative behavior of academic scientists in six fields of science and engineering,RESEARCH POLICY,Nov 2010,2010,"Norms of academic science and engineering are moving in the direction of broader applicability and transferability of knowledge beyond the borders of the university. In response, scientists are expected to engage in collaboration that includes both basic and applied collaborative activities. More specifically, the norms of science are beginning to change to allow for novel forms of collaboration that involve sharing of research ideas on multiple facets of collaborative work. This paper examines the extent to which multifaceted collaboration is attributable to relational aspects of individuals' networks. Specifically, we ask the question: what relational aspects of social capital determine multifaceted collaboration among scientists in six fields of science and engineering? Borrowing literature from social capital and science and technology (S&T) human capital, this paper develops a multi-level model of multifaceted collaboration and presents a set of testable hypotheses. Then using data from a national survey of men and women faculty in six fields, we analyze the multi-level data: relationship or dyad level (level 1) and ego level (level 2) with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to predict multifaceted collaboration of academic scientists. Findings show that some relational characteristics explain multifaceted collaborative behavior as predicted, while others behave in unexpected ways. Conclusions place the findings in context for theory and policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
"Do You Two Know Each Other? Transitivity, Homophily, and the Need for (Network) Closure",JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2010,2010,"The authors investigate whether need for closure affects how people seek order in judging social relations. In Study 1, the authors find that people who have a high need for closure (NFC) were more likely to assume their social contacts were connected to each other (i.e., transitivity) when this was not the case. In Studies 2 and 3, the authors examine another form of order in network relations-racial homophily-and find that high-NFC participants were more inclined to believe that 2 individuals from the same racial category (e.g., African American) were friends than two racially dissimilar individuals. Furthermore, high-NFC individuals were more likely to make errors when judging a racially mixed group of people; specifically, they recalled more racial homophily (racially similar people sitting closer together) than had actually appeared.",
SELECTION AND SOCIALIZATION OF INTERNALIZING PROBLEMS IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2010,2010,"This study investigated selection and socialization as contributors to homophily of internalizing problems during middle childhood Longitudinal social network analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which similarity on depression, loneliness, and social anxiety influences friendship formation (i e, selection) as well as the extent to which friendship contributes to similarity on these variables (i e, socialization) across one academic year Participants included 1,016 third grade students in 11 schools Results suggested that children tended to select others with similar levels of loneliness, but not depression or social anxiety, as friends In addition, children's levels of loneliness, depression, and social anxiety became more similar to the average level of their friends over time Discussion focuses on the consistency of the findings with studies of older populations as well as methodological considerations relevant to future studies",
Supplier traits for better customer firm innovation performance,INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT,Oct 2010,2010,"Previous research on embedded ties with suppliers in an innovation context has Ignored the need for customer firms to assess and select suppliers on the basis of market orientation strategies and relationship marketing attributes. To address this void, this study investigates the effects of suppliers' downstream customer orientation and supplier-customer homophily (i.e, similarity of the supplier and the customer) on the customers' innovation performance. Data pertaining to new product development projects with contributions from supplier firms was collected on both sides of the supplier-customer dyad The analysis shows that downstream customer orientation and supplier-customer homophily have a significant impact on the customer firms' new product efficiency (i.e project cost and project speed) and new product effectiveness (i.e., innovativeness), which in turn positively influence new product performance in terms of profitability, market share, and growth.

Real and Perceived Attitude Agreement in Social Networks,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,Oct 2010,2010,"It is often asserted that friends and acquaintances have more similar beliefs and attitudes than do strangers; yet empirical studies disagree over exactly how much diversity of opinion exists within local social networks and, relatedly, how much awareness individuals have of their neighbors' views. This article reports results from a network survey, conducted on the Facebook social networking platform, in which participants were asked about their own political attitudes, as well as their beliefs about their friends' attitudes. Although considerable attitude similarity exists among friends, the results show that friends disagree more than they think they do. In particular, friends are typically unaware of their disagreements, even when they say they discuss the topic, suggesting that discussion is not the primary means by which friends infer each other's views on particular issues. Rather, it appears that respondents infer opinions in part by relying on stereotypes of their friends and in part by projecting their own views. The resulting gap between real and perceived agreement may have implications for the dynamics of political polarization and theories of social influence in general.",
Beyond and Below Racial Homophily: ERG Models of a Friendship Network Documented on Facebook,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Sep 2010,2010,"A notable feature of U. S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily-the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from ""elite"" backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.",
Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking? Peer Group Similarities in Adolescent Hostile Attribution Tendencies,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Sep 2010,2010,"A bias toward attributing hostile intent to others has been linked to aggression. In an adolescent sample, the question of whether peer group homophily exists in the tendency toward attributing hostile intent was investigated. Hostile attribution tendencies and self-reported aggressive behaviors were assessed in a normative sample of 910 adolescents and average peer group scores were computed on the basis of nominated friend scores. Results indicated that adolescents showed significant correlations between their own level of hostile attributions and that of their peer group. Further analyses indicated that this effect occurred specifically in reciprocal friendships and was retained even when own and peer group levels of aggression were controlled.",
Mate selection as a mutual choice-How men and women reply to contact offers in online dating,KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE,Sep 2010,2010,"This study continues our analyses of contacting behavior in online dating (KZfSS 2/2009). As the beginning and continuation of a relationship is based on consensual decisions of both partners to interact, we concentrate on the question if and how potential partners indeed reply to contact offers. Data from online dating platforms therefore offer a unique opportunity for sociologists to study how partnerships are initiated and how they develop over time. This contribution provides four important empirical results: Firstly, it demonstrates that only 20% of all first contact offers are answered. This is a surprisingly small proportion. Secondly, it supports the hypothesis of homophily. According to this hypothesis, people with similar education, age and physical attractiveness should prefer each other and thus are more likely to form couples. Third, it shows that women still have severe problems to reply to contact offers from lower educated men, while men are already less reluctant to reply to higher educated women. Thus, the rarity of couples where women are higher educated than their partners are to a large proportion the consequence of women's preferences rather than men's preferences. Finally, our study does not find any support for the trade-off hypothesis, indicating that women do not exchange their physical attractiveness for men's educational resources, and vice versa.",
The World Is Not Small for Everyone: Inequity in Searching for Knowledge in Organizations,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Sep 2010,2010,"We explore why some employees may be at a disadvantage in searching for information in organizations. The ""small-world"" argument in social network theory emphasizes that people are, on average, only a few connections away from the information they seek. However, we argue that such a network structure does not benefit everyone: some employees may have longer search paths in locating knowledge in an organization-their world may be large. We theorize that this disadvantage is the result of more than just an inferior network position. Instead, two mechanisms-periphery status and homophily-jointly operate to aggravate the inefficiency of search for knowledge. Employees who belong to the periphery of an organization because of their minority gender status, lower tenure, or poor connectedness have limited awareness of who knows what and a lower ability to seek help from others best suited to guide the search. When they start a search chain, they are likely to engage in homophilous search by contacting colleagues like themselves, thus contacting others who also belong to the periphery. To search effectively, employees on the periphery need to engage in heterophilous search behaviors by crossing social boundaries. We find support for these arguments in a network field experiment consisting of 381 unfolding search chains in a large multinational professional services firm. The framework helps explain employees' unequal access to the knowledge they seek, a poorly understood yet important type of organizational inequity in an information economy.",
Collaboration in sensor network research: an in-depth longitudinal analysis of assortative mixing patterns,SCIENTOMETRICS,Sep 2010,2010,"Many investigations of scientific collaboration are based on statistical analyses of large networks constructed from bibliographic repositories. These investigations often rely on a wealth of bibliographic data, but very little or no other information about the individuals in the network, and thus, fail to illustrate the broader social and academic landscape in which collaboration takes place. In this article, we perform an in-depth longitudinal analysis of a relatively small network of scientific collaboration (N = 291) constructed from the bibliographic record of a research centerin the development and application of wireless and sensor network technologies. We perform a preliminary analysis of selected structural properties of the network, computing its range, configuration and topology. We then support our preliminary statistical analysis with an in-depth temporal investigation of the assortative mixing of selected node characteristics, unveiling the researchers' propensity to collaborate preferentially with others with a similar academic profile. Our qualitative analysis of mixing patterns offers clues as to the nature of the scientific community being modeled in relation to its organizational, disciplinary, institutional, and international arrangements of collaboration.",
Living Room vs Concert Hall Patterns of Music Consumption in Flanders,SOCIAL FORCES,Sep 2010,2010,"In this article we probe the interplay between public and private music consumption using a large-scale survey of the Flemish population in Belgium We analyze whether public and private music consumption have different correlates and to what extent there is convergence between the genres that people listen to at home and at concerts Results show that music consumption is positively related to all indicators of cultural capital educational attainment, enrolment in arts classes and public participation of the parents The effects are strongest for high-brow genres such as classical and opera and diminish for middle-brow and low-brow genres such as world/traditional music or pop/rock Cultural capital is more important for public participation than for private consumption This suggests that not only information processing capacity is involved when attending concerts, but also social barriers such as familiarity with the rules of decorum and network homophily Omnivorousness in music consumption is especially situated in the private sphere",
Do They Get What They Want or Are They Stuck With What They Can Get? Testing Homophily Against Default Selection for Friendships of Highly Aggressive Boys. The TRAILS Study,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,Aug 2010,2010,"In this study a homophily selection hypothesis was tested against a default selection hypothesis, to answer whether preferred and realized friendships of highly aggressive boys differed. In a large peer-nomination sample, we assessed who highly overt aggressive, low prosocial boys (n = 181) nominated as friends (preferred friendships) and who among the nominated friends reciprocated the friendship (realized friendships). These preferred and realized friendships were compared with those of less aggressive (n = 1,268) and highly aggressive but also prosocial boys (bi-strategics; n = 55). Results showed that less aggressive boys preferred peers low on aggression, whereas highly aggressive and bi-strategic boys preferred peers not particular high or low on aggression. In line with default selection, highly aggressive boys ended up with aggressive peers even though that was not their preference. In general, received support proved an important determinant of highly aggressive, bi-strategic, and less aggressive boys' preferred and realized friendships. Especially highly aggressive boys preferred emotionally supportive friends, but ended up with the least supportive peers. In sum, for friendships of highly overt aggressive boys, the evidence favors default selection over homophily selection.",
Effects of mass media action on the Axelrod model with social influence,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Jul 21 2010,2010,"The use of dyadic interaction between agents, in combination with homophily (the principle that ""likes attract"") in the Axelrod model for the study of cultural dissemination, has two important problems: the prediction of monoculture in large societies and an extremely narrow window of noise levels in which diversity with local convergence is obtained. Recently, the inclusion of social influence has proven to overcome them [A. Flache and M. W. Macy, e-print arXiv:0808.2710]. Here, we extend the Axelrod model with social influence interaction for the study of mass media effects through the inclusion of a superagent which acts over the whole system and has non-null overlap with each agent of the society. The dependence with different parameters as the initial social diversity, size effects, mass media strength, and noise is outlined. Our results might be relevant in several socioeconomic contexts and for the study of the emergence of collective behavior in complex social systems.",
Anomia and the sacred canopy: Testing a network theory,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2010,2010,"This article evaluates the Durkheim/Berger argument that integration in a network of co-religionists protects against anomia. The 1985 General Social Survey network instrument is used to evaluate the effect of integration on anomia and the probability of unhappiness. Results indicate that contact with religiously homogeneous others paired with personal religious belief reduces anomia and the likelihood of unhappiness. Additionally, while ego/alter closeness is important, alter/alter closeness is not. These results suggest that individuals benefit from religious association more so than religious community. Additional analyses indicate that these results are unlikely to be due to homophily. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Following the chain to elusive anglers,FISH AND FISHERIES,Jun 2010,2010,"Obtaining reliable estimates of important parameters from recreational fisheries is problematic but critical for stock assessment and effective resource management. Sampling methodologies based on traditional design-based sampling theory, is inadequate in obtaining representative catch and effort data, social or demographical characterization, or fisher behaviour from small hard-to-reach components within recreational fisheries (e. g. specialized sport fisheries) that may account for the majority of the catch for some species. A model-based approach to sampling is necessary. Researchers in other disciplines including epidemiology and social sciences routinely survey rare or 'hidden' populations within the general community by penetration of social networks rather than by interception of individuals. We encourage fisheries researchers to rethink survey designs and consider the social elements of recreational fishing. Employing chain-referral methods, such as respondent-driven sampling (RDS), may be a statistically robust and cost-effective option for sampling elusive sub-elements within recreational fisheries. Chain-referral sampling methodology is outlined and an example of a complemented 'RDS-recapture' survey design is introduced as a cost-effective application to estimating total catch in recreational fisheries.",
Interorganizational Networking Patterns Among Development Organizations,JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION,Jun 2010,2010,"This research seeks to explain the structure of the interorganizational network of international development organizations, including international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). The study uses a multitheoretical, multilevel model to examine the endogenous and exogenous influences on the international development organization network. Results indicate that homophily, mutuality, transitivity, and centralization influence the configuration of the international development organizational network. In particular, IGOs tended to collaborate with IGOs; both INGOs and IGOs were likely to seek joint dependencies over asymmetric dependencies; some organizations acted as intermediary coordinators; and organizations were more likely to form collaborations with partners of partners. Implications for executive directors of INGOs and policymakers are drawn from the results.",
Patterns and structures of intra-organizational learning networks within a knowledge-intensive organization,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,Jun 2010,2010,"This paper employs the network perspective to study patterns and structures of intra-organizational learning networks. The theoretical background draws from cognitive theories, theories of homophily and proximity, theories of social exchange, the theory of generalized exchange, small-worlds theory, and social process theory. The levels of analysis applied are actor, dyadic, triadic, and global. Confirmatory social network analysis (exponential random graph modeling) was employed for data analysis. Findings suggest: (1) central actors in the learning network are experienced and hold senior positions in the organizational hierarchy; (2) evidence of homophily (in terms of gender, tenure, and hierarchical level relations) and proximity (in terms of geographical and departmental distances) in learning relationships; (3) learning relationships are non-reciprocal; and (4) transitivity and high local clustering with sparse inter-cluster ties are significant for intra-organizational learning networks.

Relational effects on knowledge integration: the differential effects on search and transfer,KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT RESEARCH & PRACTICE,Jun 2010,2010,"The paper investigates the effect of homophily and status differences on knowledge integration among individuals involved in product development activities. By distinguishing between search and transfer as two integral parts of the knowledge integration process, the paper addresses the question of how cognitive and motivational barriers to knowledge integration operate differently through the search and the transfer processes respectively. A study of 434 knowledge integration activities among 49 participants in four software development teams suggests that while search is directed both by homophily and by status differences among team participants, only status differences affect the perceived value of knowledge transfer activities. Further, the study indicates that there is not necessarily a correspondence between the status cues that direct search activities and the status cues that drive the perceived value of knowledge transfer activities among team participants.

Can Cultural Worldviews Influence Network Composition?,SOCIAL FORCES,Jun 2010,2010,"Most sociological research assumes that social network composition shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the influence of other structural factors, including prior network composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be reconsidered.",
Network organizations of general practitioners: antecedents of formation and consequences of participation,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,May 11 2010,2010,"Background: Network forms of organization are increasingly popular in primary care. At the end of the 1990s General Practitioners (GPs) in Italy were given the opportunity to adopt network forms of organization with the aim of improving the quality of their services. However factors affecting GPs' choices to join a network and the consequences of network membership have not been evaluated.Methods: Administrative data of a Local Health Authority in Central Italy were analyzed using statistical methods at individual and dyadic levels of analysis.Results: Homophily factors seem to influence a GP's choice of network. The consequences of network membership on GP performances seem very limited.Conclusions: When considering to foster the diffusion of network organizational forms in health care creating a network structure, like that of Italian GPs, is not sufficient. Other features of the implementation phase, work organization and human resource management should also be considered.",
Patterns of cross-orientation friendships in high schools,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,May 2010,2010,"Previous studies indicate that school friendship networks of sexual minority students (students with non-heterosexual orientations) consist mostly of straight peers, but little is known about these straight friends. This paper examines what background characteristics predict straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends by analyzing friendship nomination data from two large high schools included in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Straight females are more likely than straight males to have cross-orientation friendships particularly with sexual minority males. Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

How do MNCs establish their talent pools? Influences on individuals' likelihood of being labeled as talent,JOURNAL OF WORLD BUSINESS,Apr 2010,2010,"Addressing the research question of what influences the likelihood of an individual being labeled as 'talent' in MNCs, this paper seeks to understand the decision processes involved in the identification of MNC-internal talent. We develop a framework suggesting that the decision to include an employee in a corporate talent pool is a two-stage decision process in which mostly experience-based (on-line) performance appraisal evaluations are used as an input in largely cognition-based (off-line) managerial decision making. Consequently, talent pool inclusion is determined not only by performance appraisal evaluations, but also a number of factors that influence the decision making in the second stage of the talent identification process. Using empirical insights from an in-depth case study as illustrations, we identify three such factors cultural and institutional distance between the locations of a potential member of the talent pool and the decision makers; homophily between the individual and the decision makers: and the network position of the person in question.

Results suggest that not only are peripheral group members and group members with dissimilar self-perceptions of popularity more likely to change groups, but they have more similar self-perceptions of popularity in their new groups. By employing a novel method of measuring within-group homophily, the current study expands the sparse literature on why individuals might change group membership.",
Sampling and Recruitment Issues in Qualitative Drugs Research: Reflections on the Study of Club Drug Users in Metro New York,SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE,Apr 2010,2010,"This paper describes the role and implications of sampling and recruitment in qualitative drugs research. To provide further detail of some issues pertaining to sampling in qualitative and ethnographic projects, the author describes recent experiences utilizing theoretical sampling and time-space sampling to study club drug users. The author details practical challenges experienced with the implementation of these sampling methodologies and with the results they produced. Attention is paid to the role that the environmental factors at clubs play in the implementation of sampling methods, issues related to network methods in recruitment, and practical implications of managing team-based recruitment strategies.</.",
Identifying the roles of race-based choice and chance in high school friendship network formation,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Mar 16 2010,2010,"Homophily, the tendency of people to associate with others similar to themselves, is observed in many social networks, ranging from friendships to marriages to business relationships, and is based on a variety of characteristics, including race, age, gender, religion, and education. We present a technique for distinguishing two primary sources of homophily: biases in the preferences of individuals over the types of their friends and biases in the chances that people meet individuals of other types. We use this technique to analyze racial patterns in friendship networks in a set of American high schools from the Add Health dataset. Biases in preferences and biases in meeting rates are both highly significant in these data, and both types of biases differ significantly across races. Asians and Blacks are biased toward interacting with their own race at rates > 7 times higher than Whites, whereas Hispanics exhibit an intermediate bias in meeting opportunities. Asians exhibit the least preference bias, valuing friendships with other types 90% as much as friendships with Asians, whereas Blacks and Hispanics value friendships with other types 55% and 65% as much as same-type friendships, respectively, and Whites fall in between, valuing other-type friendships 75% as much as friendships with Whites. Meetings are significantly more biased in large schools (> 1,000 students) than in small schools (< 1,000 students), and biases in preferences exhibit some significant variation with the median household income levels in the counties surrounding the schools.",
Homophily in the Digital World A LiveJournal Case Study,IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING,MAR-APR 2010,2010,"Are two users more likely to be friends if they share common interests? Are two users more likely to share common interests if they're friends? The authors study the phenomenon of homophily in the digital world by answering these central questions. Unlike the physical world, the digital world doesn't impose any geographic or organizational constraints on friendships. So, although online friends might share common interests, a priori there's no reason to believe that two users with common interests are more likely to be friends. Using data from LiveJournal, the authors show that the answer to both questions is yes.",
Determinants of the need for homophily in referral criteria: The case of clergy referrals to mental health professionals in Singapore,JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE,Mar 2010,2010,"Homophily, the tendency to seek out those who are similar, is a powerful force in structuring the relations that people have in a variety of social settings including the selection of partnerships. Despite this, attitudinal homophily has seldom been discussed in relation to referral practices, an important consideration in health care delivery. In this paper Christian clergy in Singapore are examined as to the extent they impose homophily as a selection criteria for referrals to mental health professionals. This is an important consideration as clergy are popular sources of help though they seldom refer their clients to mental health professionals due to the competition between health sectors. This study based on survey data collected from a representative sample of Singaporean clergymen predicts that those who expect referral partners to be homophilous include those with greater Christian conservatism, professional ideology and beliefs in clergy competence in handling emotional and mental problems. These ministers tended to come from smaller congregations and had more psychological education. In essence clergy who value homophily in referral partners are concerned about the relational risk involved in the referral process and use homophily in the hope that they can find referral partners who do not undermine their authority or jeopardize laymen's faith.",
Birds of a feather flock together - and fall ill? Migrant homophily and health in Sweden,SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS,Mar 2010,2010,"Although studies show that health inequities between ethnic groups exist, few have expressed interest in the origins of these disparities. As homophily (the phenomenon that people principally form relationships with those who are similar to them) influences people's norms and interactions, it might be an important property of migrants' networks, and have implications on their health. The aim of this study is to examine health inequities between natives and immigrants in Sweden and the health consequences arising from participation in homogenous migrant networks. Using total population registers and representative survey data initial analyses show that migrants experience poorer health than native Swedes. The findings further suggest that homophily is a prominent feature of migrant social networks and that migrants in networks with a high proportion of other migrants experience poorer health than those who include a high proportion of natives in their networks. However, unhealthy behaviour and disadvantaged social conditions may account for a considerable share of their excess risk. Hence, network closure may reinforce and maintain norms leading to negative behaviour and social conditions in such networks.",
"When Does Race Matter? Race, Sex, and Dating at an Elite University",JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY,Feb 2010,2010,"This paper unites quantitative and qualitative data from the College Social Life Survey (n = 732) to describe and explain patterns of racial homophily in undergraduate sexual/romantic relationships at an elite university, a closed social setting. It expands the literature on interracial romantic unions by comparing homophily in hookups ( uncommitted sexual interactions), dates, and long-term relationships. Although this population embodies many characteristics associated with greater racial mixing ( youth, education, status equality, geographical proximity, racial diversity, independence from family), racial homophily is still strongly evident. Variation in levels of homophily among relationship types and among racial groups is explained by differences in desired homophily, social network segregation, and participation in formal race-based student organizations. Black students are particularly socially isolated.",
Link Homophily in the Application Layer and its Usage in Traffic Classification,2010 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM,2010,2010,"We address the following questions. Is there link homophily in the application layer traffic? If so, can it be used to accurately classify traffic in network trace data without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level? Our research shows that the answers to both of these questions are affirmative in real network trace data. Specifically, we define link homophily to be the tendency for flows with common IP hosts to have the same application (P2P, Web, etc.) compared to randomly selected flows. The presence of link homophily in trace data provides us with statistical dependencies between flows that share common IP hosts. We utilize these dependencies to classify application layer traffic without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level. In particular, we introduce a new statistical relational learning algorithm, called Neighboring Link Classifier with Relaxation Labeling (NLC+RL). Our algorithm has no training phase and does not require features to be constructed. All that it needs to start the classification process is traffic information on a small portion of the initial flows, which we refer to as seeds. In all our traces, NLC+RL achieves above 90% accuracy with less than 5% seed size; it is robust to errors in the seeds and various seed-selection biases; and it is able to accurately classify challenging traffic such as P2P with over 90% Precision and Recall.",
Moderated Class-Membership Interchange in Iterative Multi-relational Graph Classifier,"ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT WEB MASTERING-2, PROCEEDINGS",2010,2010,"Organizing information resources into classes helps significantly in searching in massive volumes of on line documents available through the Web or other information sources such as electronic mail, digital libraries, corporate databases. Existing classification methods are often based only on own content of document, i.e. its attributes. Considering relations in the web document space brings better results. We adopt multi relational classification that interconnects attribute based classifiers with iterative optimization based on relational heterogeneous graph structures, while different types of instances and various relation types can be classified together. We establish moderated class membership spreading mechanism in multi relational graphs and compare the impact of various levels of regulation in collective inference classifier. The experiments based on large-scale graphs originated in MAPEKUS research project data set (web portals of scientific libraries) demonstrate that moderated class-membership spreading significantly increases accuracy of the relational classifier (up to 10%) and protects instances with heterophilic neighborhood to be misclassified.",

User Generated Content Consumption and Social Networking in Knowledge-Sharing OSNs,"ADVANCES IN SOCIAL COMPUTING, PROCEEDINGS",2010,2010,"Knowledge-sharing online social networks are becoming increasingly pervasive and popular. While the user-to-user interactions in these networks have received substantial attention, the consumption of user generated content has not been studied extensively. In this work, we use data gathered from digg . com to present novel findings and draw important sociological conclusions regarding the intimate relationship between consumption and social networking. We first demonstrate that individuals' consumption habits influence their friend networks, consistent with the concept of homophily. We then show that one's social network can also influence the consumption of a submission through the activation of an extended friend network. Finally, we investigate the level of reciprocity, or balance, in the network and uncover relationships that are significantly less balanced than expected.",
Opinion dynamics with confidence threshold: an alternative to the Axelrod model,ALEA-LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY AND MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS,2010,2010,"The voter model and the Axelrod model are two of the main stochastic processes that describe the spread of opinions on networks. The former includes social influence, the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they interact, while the latter also accounts for homophily, the tendency to interact more frequently with individuals which are more similar. The Axelrod model has been extensively studied during the past ten years based on numerical simulations. In contrast, we give rigorous analytical results for a generalization of the voter model that is closely related to the Axelrod model as it combines social influence and confidence threshold, which is modeled somewhat similarly to homophily. Each vertex of the network, represented by a finite connected graph, is characterized by an opinion and may interact with its adjacent vertices. Like the voter model, an interaction results in an agreement between both interacting vertices social influence but unlike the voter model, an interaction takes place if and only if the vertices' opinions are within a certain distance confidence threshold. In a deterministic static approach, we first give lower and upper hounds for the maximum number of opinions that can be supported by the network as a function of the confidence threshold and various characteristics of the graph. The number of opinions coexisting at equilibrium is then investigated in a probabilistic dynamic approach for the stochastic process starting from a random configuration. It is proved that, for large confidence thresholds, the probability of an ultimate consensus on any connected graph is strictly positive whereas, with high probability, any fraction of the opinions is retained by the dynamics in one dimension provided the confidence threshold is small enough.",
"Dynamics of Dyads in Social Networks: Assortative, Relational, and Proximity Mechanisms","ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY, VOL 36",2010,2010,"Embeddedness in social networks is increasingly seen as a root cause of human achievement, social stratification, and actor behavior. In this article, we review sociological research that examines the processes through which dyadic ties form, persist, and dissolve. Three sociological mechanisms are overviewed: assortative mechanisms that draw attention to the role of actors' attributes, relational mechanisms that emphasize the influence of existing relationships and network positions, and proximity mechanisms that focus on the social organization of interaction.",
Declarative and Numerical Analysis of Edge Creation Process in Trust-Based Social Networks,DECLARATIVE AGENT LANGUAGES AND TECHNOLOGIES VII,2010,2010,"Online social networks are enjoying drastic increase in their population and connectivity. One of the fundamental issues in these networks is trust, which is an essential factor in quality of the connections among diverse nodes in the network. To address the efficiency in the interactions among nodes, we propose in this paper a trust-based architecture applicable to maintain interactions in multi-agent-based social networks. We provide a detailed discussion over the network formation by taking into account the edge creation factors classified as homophily, confounding and influence. We systematically inspire different involving factors to observe evolution of trust-based interconnections in a microscopic manner. We also provide declarative and numerical analysis of the proposed model and its assessment and discuss the system implementation, along with simulations obtained from a number of executions compared with the broadly known frameworks.",
Emerging Spatiotemporal Patterns from Discrete Migration Dynamics of Heterogeneous Agents,DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY,2010,2010,"We propose a discrete agent-based model to investigate the migration dynamics of heterogeneous individuals. Compatibility among agents of different types is expressed in terms of homophily parameters capturing the extent to which similar individuals are attracted to, or dissimilar individuals are repelled by, each other. Based on agent-based simulations, we establish the connection between emerging spatiotemporal patterns and the homophily parameters. Key results are presented in a novel phase diagram, which reveals a wide range of spatial patterns including the cell, worm, herd, amoeba, and swarm modes under the dynamic regime and the separation, ghetto, and integration modes under the stationary one. Our model thus provides a generalized framework encompassing both static equilibrium and nonstationary systems to investigate the impact of agent heterogeneity on population dynamics. We demonstrate potential applications of our model to social systems using sexual segregation of ungulate habitats as a case study.",
"Competing Structure, Competing Views: The Role of Formal and Informal Social Structures in Shaping Stakeholder Perceptions",ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,2010,2010,"What is social structure, and how does it influence the views and behaviors of land managers? In this paper, we unpack the term ""social structure"" in the context of current research on institutions, social networks, and their role(s) in resource management. We identify two different kinds of structure, formal and informal, and explore how these link to views of land management and management practice. Formal structures refer to intentionally designed organizations that arise out of larger institutional arrangements; informal ones refer to social networks, based on the communication contacts individuals possess. Our findings show significant correlations between respondents' views regarding land management and their social networks; it is these informal structures that have greater influence on what stakeholders perceive. These findings suggest that stakeholders are less influenced by their particular organizational affiliation or category (e.g., ""conservationist"" versus ""farmer""), and more by whom they speak with on a regular basis regarding land management. We conclude with a discussion on the practical implications for resource managers wishing to ""design"" participatory management, arguing that, if ""diversity"" is the goal in designing such participatory processes, then diversity needs to translate beyond stakeholder categories to include consideration for the personal, social networks surrounding stakeholders.",
Inferring preference correlations from social networks,ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,JAN-FEB 2010,2010,"Identifying consumer preferences is a key challenge in customizing electronic commerce sites to individual users. The increasing availability of online social networks provides one approach to this problem: people linked in these networks often share preferences, allowing inference of interest in products based on knowledge of a consumer's network neighbors and their interests. This paper evaluates the benefits of inference from online social networks in two contexts: a random graph model and a web site allowing people to both express preferences and form distinct social and preference links. We determine conditions on network topology and preference correlations leading to extended clusters of people with similar interests. Knowledge of when such clusters occur improves the usefulness of social network-based inference for identifying products likely to interest consumers based on information from a few people in the network. Such estimates could help sellers design customized bundles of products and improve combinatorial auctions for complementary products. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Inter-organisational collective learning: the case of biotechnology in France,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT,2010,2010,"We explore inter-organisational collective learning by assuming that authority relationships are different at the inter- and the intra-organisational level. This difference has implications for the way in which a collective solves the problems related to the creation of a hierarchy between different bodies of appropriate knowledge. At the intra-organisational level, cognitive conflicts are solved by centralisation and alignment with opinion leaders who often have formal and epistemic authority. In this context, members tend not to seek advice from others 'below' them in the organisational status hierarchy. At the inter-organisational level, we show that the absence of a formal hierarchy encourages entrepreneurs to invest heavily in relational activity. This behaviour allows them to keep their status in a context where epistemic conflicts become entrenched, following a polarisation process, in different epistemic communities. We illustrate this phenomenon with an empirical study of entrepreneurs in the French biotech industry.",
"Determinants of Third Parties' Intervention and Alignment Choices in Ongoing Conflicts, 1946-2001",FOREIGN POLICY ANALYSIS,Jan 2010,2010,"The decision to intervene in ongoing conflicts is one of the most difficult foreign policy choices states often face. Yet, studies of third parties' joining behavior have been rare and limited in several respects. First, they have explored only a subset of all interventions military interventions. Second, they have concentrated on security-based determinants of intervention power and alliance considerations while underplaying other possible motivations behind the decision to intervene. Third, they have explored intervention and alignment choices as separate issues. This paper proposes a model of joining behavior that includes both security considerations and homophilous network ties as determinants of third parties' intervention and alignment choices. The model is tested on military and nonmilitary interventions data from Corbetta and Dixon (2005) for the 1946-2001 period. The results from a boolean logit estimation indicate that (1) the intervention decision is the result of both security-driven, pragmatic considerations and homophily between joiners and disputants; and (2) opposition to a party in a conflict is as important as a third party's social proximity to the side being supported.",
Ocean of Information: Fusing Aggregate & Individual Dynamics for Metropolitan Analysis,IUI 2010,2010,2010,"In this paper, we propose a tool to explore human movement dynamics in a Metropolitan Area. By analyzing a mass of individual cell phone traces, we build a Human-City Interaction System for understanding urban mobility patterns at different user-controlled temporal and geographic scales. We solve the problems that are found in available tools for spatio-temporal analysis, by allowing seamless manipulability and introducing a simultaneous\multi-scale visualization of individual and aggregate flows. Our tool is built to support the exploration and discovery of urban mobility patterns and the daily interactions of millions of people. Moreover, we implement an intelligent algorithm to evaluate the level of mobility homophily of people moving from place to place.",
Homophily Among Peer Groups Members' Perceived Self-Regulated Learning,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATION,2010,2010,"The present study is one of the first examining whether peer group members hold similar levels of self-regulated learning. The study specifically addresses the potential homophily among group members' regulative abilities (metacognition, environment regulation, effort regulation, peer learning, and help seeking) and whether group members' regulative abilities predict affiliates' academic performance. The study surveyed 9th-grade students from a Midwestern high school about their regulative abilities for mathematics. Results suggest that peer groups members' effort regulation is similar among peer affiliates but not other regulative abilities. In addition, peer group members' regulative abilities do not predict each others' academic performance.",
Twitter as Personal Political Communities and Networked Public Sphere,Journal of Political Communication,2010,2010,"Social Network Services are increasingly attracting attentions from academia as well as politicians. By conducting a case study of politicians' Twitter network, this paper discusses on the Twitter's communication structure and examines the possibility of Twitter as personal political communities and/or networked public spheres. Personal communities are constructed differently depending on politicians' attitudes toward Twitter and their communication styles. Some are emotional communities where social ties between politicians and their followers are formed by habitual communicative acts such as tweets, retweets, and mentions. Others work as networked public spheres where political issues are discussed and exchanged. However, most personal communities still tend to be homophily, which means a tendency that a contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people. To sum up, Twitter, still in progress like any other SNS, shows both potentials and limitations as a political communication channel.",
The Evolution of Interaction Networks in Massively Multiplayer Online Games,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2010,2010,"This article examines the co-evolution of players' individual performance and their interaction network in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG). The objective is to test whether the application of theories from the real world is valid in virtual worlds. While the results indicate that the structural effects and demographic variables active in the real world influence the evolution of the players' interaction network in MMOGs (e. g. transitivity, reciprocity, and homophily), they do not provide evidence that players' structural embeddedness in the interaction network influences player performance. These findings have important implications for researchers and practitioners who need to understand social processes in MMOGs (e. g., when launching marketing campaigns in MMOGs) or who study MMOGs and then use their findings to draw conclusions about the real world (e. g., when analyzing the relationship between employee performance and network structure).",
Social networks and labor market transitions,LABOUR ECONOMICS,Jan 2010,2010,"We study the influence of social networks on labor market transitions. We develop the first model where social ties and job status coevolve through time. Our key assumption is that the probability of formation of a new tie is greater between two employed individuals than between an employed and an unemployed individual. We show that this assumption generally generates negative duration dependence of exit rates from unemployment. Our model has a number of novel testable implications. For instance, we show that a higher connectivity among unemployed individuals reduces duration dependence and that exit rates depend positively on the duration of the last job held by the unemployed worker.

The Coevolution of Networks and Political Attitudes,POLITICAL COMMUNICATION,2010,2010,"How do attitudes and social affiliations coevolve? A long stream of research has focused on the relationship between attitudes and social affiliations. However, in most of this research the causal relationship between views and affiliations is difficult to discern definitively: Do people influence each other's views so that they converge over time or do they primarily affiliate (by choice or happenstance) with those of similar views? Here we use longitudinal attitudinal and whole network data collected at critical times (notably, at the inception of the system) to identify robustly the determinants of attitudes and affiliations. We find significant conformity tendencies: Individuals shift their political views toward the political views of their associates. This conformity is driven by social ties rather than task ties. We also find that political views are notably unimportant as a driver for the formation of relationships.",
An Internet Mediated Domain of Local Governance?,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON EGOVERNMENT,2010,2010,"The UK government, with a view to redressing growing civic disenchantment with elected representatives and governmental institutions, continues to look to new technologies to provide a new 'architecture of participation'. But what are the current prospects for the local governance process being re-invented at the interface of the social and the technological? This paper seeks to empirically address this question by exploring the use made of the internet by a variety of local civic, political and institutional actors during a 2008 UK local referendum on introducing the largest traffic congestion charging scheme in the world. This paper draws upon Social Network Analysis theory and utilises Lusher and Ackland's innovative 'Relational Hyperlink Analysis' to quantitatively explore significance and meaning in a conceptually defined internet mediated domain of local governance. This approach reveals a distinct homophily effect within the online 'congestion charge' network with local governance sites mainly hyperlinking to each other and websites hosting Web 2.0 technologies also more likely to only reference each other. The paper concludes that, in this instance, where civic and local government actors failed to engage each other online, use of the web as a space for local deliberation on the policy making process is very much work in progress. As a consequence the potential of a new, civic, 'architecture of participation' has yet to be fully exploited by civic leaders and activists.",
REPRESENTING DYNAMIC SOCIAL NETWORKS IN DISCRETE EVENT SOCIAL SIMULATION,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2010 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE,2010,2010,"One of the key structural components of social systems is the social network. The representation of this network structure is key to providing a valid representation of the society under study. The social science concept of homophily provides a conceptual model of how social networks are formed and evolve over time. Previous work described the results of social simulation using a static homophily network. In order to gain the full benefit of modeling societies a representation of how the social network changes over time is required. This paper introduces the implementation of a dynamic homophily network, along with a case study exploring the sensitivity of model outputs to the parameters describing the network and applying social network change detection methods (SNCD) to model output.",
Social network engineering and race in a police academy: A longitudinal analysis,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2010,2010,"This research examined an attempt to facilitate racial integration by populating squads (i.e., workgroups) in a police academy with mixes of recruits that reflected the racial demographics of the larger cohort. This was part of the social infrastructure of the academy. Additionally, a fixed seating arrangement was considered as a second element of academy infrastructure capable of impacting racial integration. We examined the consequences of these academy components over time with regard to race by combining ethnographic accounts With social network data collected throughout the academy and using a variety of network analytic tools. These consequences with regard to race were examined as a part of social network evolution. The academy's social arrangements did accelerate the creation of social knowledge of recruits about each other and the formation of friendship ties both within and between races. However. our results point to cleat limitations to such infrastructural engineering and have implications for both recruitment to police academies and dealing with race. They shed light also oil processes of homophily and group composition over time and have implications for Studying social networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
Inequalities in network structures,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Jan 2010,2010,"We use a model of continuous attachments in networks to generate propositions concerning inequalities in network structures, and test the propositions on data from organizational settings. Our network model, inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality, reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements in the network members' choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Homophily of Neighborhood in Graph Relational Classifier,"SOFSEM 2010: THEORY AND PRACTICE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROCEEDINGS",2010,2010,"Quality of collective inference relational graph classifier depends on a. degree of homophily in a classified graph. If we increase homophily in the graph, the classifier would assign class-membership to the instances with reduced error rate. We propose to substitute traditionally used graph neighborhood method (based on direct neighborhood of vertex) with local graph ranking algorithm (activation spreading), which provides wider set of neighboring vertices and their weights. We demonstrate that our approach increases homophily in the graph by inferring optimal homophily distribution of a binary Simple Relational Classifier in an unweighted graph. We validate this ability also experimentally using the Social Network of the Slovak Companies dataset.",
Distinguishing influence-based contagion from homophily-driven diffusion in dynamic networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Dec 22 2009,2009,"Node characteristics and behaviors are often correlated with the structure of social networks over time. While evidence of this type of assortative mixing and temporal clustering of behaviors among linked nodes is used to support claims of peer influence and social contagion in networks, homophily may also explain such evidence. Here we develop a dynamic matched sample estimation framework to distinguish influence and homophily effects in dynamic networks, and we apply this framework to a global instant messaging network of 27.4 million users, using data on the day-by-day adoption of a mobile service application and users' longitudinal behavioral, demographic, and geographic data. We find that previous methods overestimate peer influence in product adoption decisions in this network by 300-700%, and that homophily explains >50% of the perceived behavioral contagion. These findings and methods are essential to both our understanding of the mechanisms that drive contagions in networks and our knowledge of how to propagate or combat them in domains as diverse as epidemiology, marketing, development economics, and public health.",

Network Formation in the Political Blogosphere: An Application of Agent Based Simulation and e-Research Tools,COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS,Nov 2009,2009,"The political blogosphere has become the focus of attention of researchers from disciplines such as political science and network science. In a recent paper, Adamic and Glance (LinkKDD '05: Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on link discovery, 2005, pp. 443-452) report differences between the linking behavior of politically conservative versus politically liberal web bloggers. We construct a simple agent-based network formation model which shows that one such difference, demonstrating what we term 'political homophily', can be generated by connecting the blogosphere to the underlying population distribution of political preferences. The model is implemented as a web service in the e-Research tool VOSON (Virtual Observatory for the Study of Online Networks), and both model and tool serve to define a natural environment for research into link formation behavior with large numbers of heterogeneous network participants.",
The Diffusion of a Task Recommendation System to Facilitate Contributions to an Online Community,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Oct 2009,2009,"This paper studies the diffusion of SuggestBot, an intelligent task recommendation system that helps people find articles to edit in Wikipedia. We investigate factors that predict who adopts SuggestBot and its impact on adopters' future contributions to this online community. Analyzing records of participants' activities in Wikipedia, we found that both individual characteristics and social ties influence adoption. Specially, we found that highly involved contributors were more likely to adopt SuggestBot; interpersonal exposure to innovation, cohesion, and tie homophily all substantially increased the likelihood of adoption. However, connections to prominent, high-status contributors did not influence adoption. Finally, although the SuggestBot innovation saw limited distribution, adopters made significantly more contributions to Wikipedia after adoption than nonadopter counterparts in the comparison group.",
The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide,PLOS ONE,Sep 30 2009,2009,"The observation that suicides sometimes cluster in space and/or time has led to suggestions that these clusters are caused by the social learning of suicide-related behaviours, or ""copycat suicides"". Point clusters are clusters of suicides localised in both time and space, and have been attributed to direct social learning from nearby individuals. Mass clusters are clusters of suicides localised in time but not space, and have been attributed to the dissemination of information concerning celebrity suicides via the mass media. Here, agent-based simulations, in combination with scan statistic methods for detecting clusters of rare events, were used to clarify the social learning processes underlying point and mass clusters. It was found that social learning between neighbouring agents did generate point clusters as predicted, although this effect was partially mimicked by homophily (individuals preferentially assorting with similar others). The one-to-many transmission dynamics characterised by the mass media were shown to generate mass clusters, but only where social learning was weak, perhaps due to prestige bias (only copying prestigious celebrities) and similarity bias (only copying similar models) acting to reduce the subset of available models. These findings can help to clarify and formalise existing hypotheses and to guide future empirical work relating to real-life copycat suicides.",
Parsing Social Network Survey Data from Hidden Populations Using Stochastic Context-Free Grammars,PLOS ONE,Sep 7 2009,2009,"Background: Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e. g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e. g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process.Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits.Conclusions: SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.",
Origins of Homophily in an Evolving Social Network,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Sep 2009,2009,"The authors investigate the origins of homophily in a large university community, using network data in which interactions, attributes, and affiliations are all recorded over time. The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to ""friend of a friend"" status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many ""generations"" of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily.",
"Explaining sociospatial patterns in South East Queensland, Australia: social homophily versus structural homophily",ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A,Sep 2009,2009,"Model simulations of residential segregation have shown that even modest levels of social homophily (or wishing to live near residents with similar social characteristics) gives rise to distinct spatial patterns of residential segregation. However, this proposition has been contested where social homophily is modest. This paper contrasts two explanations for urban sociospatial patterns (socioeconomic and demographic spatial patterns) in a region where social homophily is modest-South East Queensland (SEQ). The research question is whether sociospatial patterns are better explained by social homophily or by structural homophily. In other words, are they better explained by residents wishing to live in neighborhoods with similar people (social homophily), or by residents with similar social characteristics finding similar neighborhood physical attributes important, and thus moving to neighborhoods with similar people (structural homophily). SEQ residents were asked how important various reasons were in choosing their neighborhood. The survey data were linked to neighborhood social characteristics from census data with the aid of geographic information systems. Six neighborhood social characteristics in SEQ were investigated. Social homophily explained a small, though statistically significant, level of spatial variation in socioeconomic and ethnic (non-Western) environments. However, it did not explain any variation in the other four neighborhood social characteristics which related to household structure: that is, younger nonnuclear household environments; nuclear family environments; and older nonnuclear household environments, or disadvantaged environments. Moreover, structural homophily explained much more variation than did social homophily in all six neighborhood social characteristics. In regions such as SEQ, spatial patterns can largely be explained by structural homophily. Thus, modest levels of social homophily are not necessarily important in explaining sociospatial patterning.",
Brief Report: Sociometric Status and Behavioral Characteristics of Peer Nominated Buddies for a Child with Autism,JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS,Sep 2009,2009,"We examined social and behavioral correlates of children selected by their peers to serve as peer buddies for an unfamiliar child with autism (CWA). Participants were 293 children from two public elementary schools who completed social status, behavioral, and peer buddy nomination measures. Peer buddy nominations for a CWA were related to: (a) perceived unpopularity; (b) being viewed as helpful and smart; and (c) lacking influence regarding popularity within the classroom. In contrast, peer buddy nominations for a typical boy were related to being viewed as popular, helpful, and self-confident. Students may select a social niche for CWA based on principles of peer homophily. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.",
Exploring the antecedents of perceived diversity,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION,Sep 2009,2009,"We explore whether differences in perceptions of diversity might emanate from the characteristics of perceivers themselves rather than from the characteristics of those observed. Grounding our arguments in self- and social-identity theory, we hypothesize that individuals respond differently to the same diversity stimuli because they differ in their propensity to stereotype' and 'diversity experience.' Since individuals tend to gravitate towards similar others, we also hypothesize that perceived diversity can predict an individual's 'desire to group' with others. Over 200 individuals - staff and students -from a university were exposed to diverse stimuli in an online experiment in a hid to test the hypotheses. Structural Equation Modeling of the data generally supported the hypothesized relationships.",
Cross-Talk: The Role of Homophily and Elite Bias in Civic Associations,SOCIAL FORCES,Sep 2009,2009,"We examine the manner in which voluntary associations expose individuals to differing perspectives, or ""cross-talk."" Specifically we develop hypotheses based on the interactive roles of elite bias and homophily in structuring networks of democratic participation and test them on social network data of Los Angeles neighborhood councils. We find that homophily leads to boards less diverse than their communities, but does not lead to homogeneous cliques within boards. Moreover, we find that elite bias and homophily counteract each other in lower-status communities, leading to more diverse boards than would be predicted by homophily alone. We then examine the effects of assortative mixing on political attitudes and collective action, and find weak support for the proposition that associational diversity promotes tolerance and access to information.",
STRUCTURAL HOMOPHILY OR SOCIAL ASYMMETRY? THE FORMATION OF ALLIANCES BY POORLY EMBEDDED FIRMS,STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Sep 2009,2009,"Recent research shows that preexisting network structure constrains the formation of new interorganizational alliances. Firms that are poorly embedded in a network structure are less likely than richly embedded firms to form alliances, because they lack informational and reputational benefits. This study examines the types of ties that poor), embedded firms can form to overcome the constraints that their structural positions impose, in turn helping to explain how firms' actions can transform existing network structures. We argue that poorly embedded firms are more likely to participate in ties characterized by social asymmetry than in ties characterized by structural homophily. We analyze the terms of trade that socially asymmetric. c partners negotiate for alliance governance and discuss how such alliances influence network dynamics. To test our arguments, we use longitudinal data on the alliance activities of 97 global chemical firms from 1979 to 1991. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
"An Economic Model of Friendship: Homophily, Minorities, and Segregation",ECONOMETRICA,Jul 2009,2009,"We develop a model of friendship formation that sheds light on segregation patterns observed in social and economic networks. Individuals have types and see type-dependent benefits from friendships. We examine the properties of a steady-state equilibrium of a matching process of friendship formation. We use the model to understand three empirical patterns of friendship formation: (i) larger groups tend to form more same-type ties and fewer other-type ties than small groups, (ii) larger groups form more ties per capita, and (iii) all groups are biased towards same-type relative to demographics, with the most extreme bias coming from middle-sized groups. We show how these empirical observations can be generated by biases in preferences and biases in meetings. We also illustrate some welfare implications of the model.",
The impact of neighbourhood and municipality characteristics on social cohesion in the Netherlands,ACTA POLITICA,Jul 2009,2009,"Up till now, a systematic test of the impact of theoretically relevant locality characteristics on social cohesion has been lacking in Europe. In this paper, we investigated the impact of a wide array of characteristics of Dutch neighbourhoods and municipalities on contact frequency with one's neighbours, tolerance to neighbours from a different race, generalized social trust and volunteering. Based on the homophily proposition, we expected that ethnic and economic heterogeneity in Dutch localities negatively affect these indicators of social cohesion. We also expected that poor localities, localities with high crime rates and localities that suffer from high residential mobility rates offer their residents less favourable circumstances for social cohesion to arise. For our individual level data, we used the survey 'Culturele Veranderingen 2004', which contains 2949 individuals living in 503 neighbourhoods and 245 municipalities. Economic deprivation (at the neighbourhood level) is most consistently negatively related to social cohesion. We did not find a consistent negative impact of ethnic heterogeneity on social cohesion. We conclude that not all aspects of social cohesion are affected in the same way by neighbourhood and municipality characteristics and that the impact of these characteristics on social cohesion depends on residents' income and educational level.

"Representing degree distributions, clustering, and homophily in social networks with latent cluster random effects models",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jul 2009,2009,"Social network data often involve transitivity, homophily on observed attributes, community structure, and heterogeneity of actor degrees. We propose a latent cluster random effects model to represent all of these features, and we develop Bayesian inference for it. The model is applicable to both binary and non-binary network data. We illustrate the model using two real datasets: liking between monks and coreaderships between Slovenian publications. We also apply it to two simulated network datasets with very different network structure but the same highly skewed degree sequence generated from a preferential attachment process. One has transitivity and community structure while the other does not. Models based solely on degree distributions. such as scale-free, preferential attachment and power-law models, cannot distinguish between these very different situations, but the latent cluster random effects model does.

Relationality and social interaction,BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Jun 2009,2009,"This paper explores Bourdieu's account of a relational social space, and his relative neglect of social interaction within this framework. Bourdieu includes social capital as one of the key relational elements of his social space, but says much less about it than economic or cultural capital, and levels of social capital are rarely measured in his work. Bourdieu is reluctant to focus on the content of social networks as part of his rejection of substantialist thinking. The neglect of substantive networks creates problems for Bourdieu's framework, because many of Bourdieu's core concepts rest upon assumptions about their interactional properties (in particular, the prevalence of homophilous differential association) which are left unexamined. It is argued here that Bourdieu's neglect of the substance of social networks is related to the criticisms that Bourdieu's framework often encounters, and that this neglect bears re-examination, since it is helpful to think of the ways in which differentiated social networks contribute to the development of habitus, help form fields, and so constitute the intersubjective social relations within which sociality, and practice more generally, occur.",
Friendship Homophily Among Ethnic German Immigrants: A Longitudinal Comparison Between Recent and More Experienced Immigrant Adolescents,JOURNAL OF FAMILY PSYCHOLOGY,Jun 2009,2009,"Immigrant adolescents have been found to show high levels of friendship homophily (the tendency to prefer intra-ethnic over interethnic friends). Based on acculturation theories, we predicted longitudinal changes and interindividual differences in level and rate of change in friendship homophily by immigrant composition of school, parental objections to the cultural adaptation of their offspring, discrimination, and language use. Altogether 218 newcomer and 272 experienced adolescents who had emigrated from the former Soviet Union to Germany participated in 4 annual assessments. Friendship homophily was assessed by percentage of intra-ethnic friends. Results revealed higher levels of friendship homophily among newcomer (75%) than among experienced (65%) adolescents at Time 1, and a significant decrease over time was found only among newcomers. Higher age, higher percentage of immigrants at school, and lower levels of new language use all related to higher friendship homophily. Rate of change in friendship homophily was strongly related to change in new language use. Findings suggest that friendship formation with native adolescents is related to social learning processes, in which new language use plays a crucial role.",
Online mate search - Education-specific mechanisms of choosing contact partners,KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE,Jun 2009,2009,"The aim of this study is to analyze the role of educational qualification in the process of partner choice in ""digital marriage markets"". Using unique interaction data of individuals participating in an online dating site, we are able to reconstruct early processes of partner choices of men and women. Our results show that there is a clear tendency towards educational homophily. Individuals therefore have a strong preference for partners with the same educational level. This is particularly true for women. Our results also support the exchange theoretical hypothesis that educational homophily is stronger the higher the level of education is. If we analyze heterophile contact behavior, it is obvious that women are still reluctant to contact men with lower educational degrees. They clearly prefer men with higher educational qualification. For men it is still quite usual to contact women with lower educational degrees. Our findings therefore underline that partner choice today is still dominated by quite traditional gender preferences. Overall, our results show that digital marriage markets do not reduce social distances between social groups. Rather, the high level of homophily seems to close relationships between social groups.",
Human group formation in online guilds and offline gangs driven by a common team dynamic,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Jun 2009,2009,"Quantifying human group dynamics represents a unique challenge. Unlike animals and other biological systems, humans form groups in both real (offline) and virtual (online) spaces-from potentially dangerous street gangs populated mostly by disaffected male youths to the massive global guilds in online role-playing games for which membership currently exceeds tens of millions of people from all possible backgrounds, age groups, and genders. We have compiled and analyzed data for these two seemingly unrelated offline and online human activities and have uncovered an unexpected quantitative link between them. Although their overall dynamics differ visibly, we find that a common team-based model can accurately reproduce the quantitative features of each simply by adjusting the average tolerance level and attribute range for each population. By contrast, we find no evidence to support a version of the model based on like-seeking-like (i.e., kinship or ""homophily"").",
Eigenbehaviors: identifying structure in routine,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,May 2009,2009,"Longitudinal behavioral data generally contains a significant amount of structure. In this work, we identify the structure inherent in daily behavior with models that can accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data from individuals and communities within the social network of a population. We represent this behavioral structure by the principal components of the complete behavioral dataset, a set of characteristic vectors we have termed eigenbehaviors. In our model, an individual's behavior over a specific day can be approximated by a weighted sum of his or her primary eigenbehaviors. When these weights are calculated halfway through a day, they can be used to predict the day's remaining behaviors with 79% accuracy for our test subjects. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for this dimensionality reduction technique to infer community affiliations within the subjects' social network by clustering individuals into a ""behavior space"" spanned by a set of their aggregate eigenbehaviors. These behavior spaces make it possible to determine the behavioral similarity between both individuals and groups, enabling 96% classification accuracy of community affiliations within the population-level social network. Additionally, the distance between individuals in the behavior space can be used as an estimate for relational ties such as friendship, suggesting strong behavioral homophily amongst the subjects. This approach capitalizes on the large amount of rich data previously captured during the Reality Mining study from mobile phones continuously logging location, proximate phones, and communication of 100 subjects at MIT over the course of 9 months. As wearable sensors continue to generate these types of rich, longitudinal datasets, dimensionality reduction techniques such as eigenbehaviors will play an increasingly important role in behavioral research.",
"Closure, connectivity and degree distributions: Exponential random graph (p*) models for directed social networks",SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2009,2009,"The new higher order specifications for exponential random graph models introduced by Snijders et al. [Snijders,T.A.B., Rattison, RE., Robins G.L., Handcock. M., 2006. New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology 36,99-153] exhibit substantial improvements in model fit compared with the commonly used Markov random graph models. Snijders et al., however, concentrated on non-directed graphs, with only limited extensions to directed graphs. In particular, they presented a transitive closure parameter based on path shortening. In this paper, we explain the theoretical and empirical advantages in generalizing to additional closure effects. We propose three new triadic-based parameters to represent different versions of triadic closure: cyclic effects; transitivity based on shared choices of partners; and transitivity based on shared popularity. We interpret the last two effects as forms of structural homophily, where ties emerge because nodes share a form of localized structural equivalence. We show that, for some datasets, the path shortening parameter is insufficient for practical modeling, whereas the structural homophily parameters can produce useful models with distinctive interpretations. We also introduce corresponding lower order effects for multiple two-path connectivity. We show by example that the in- and out-degree distributions may be better modeled when star-based parameters are supplemented with parameters for the number of isolated nodes, sources (nodes with zero in-degrees) and sinks (nodes with zero out-degrees). Inclusion of a Markov mixed star parameter may also help model the correlation between in- and out-degrees. We select some 50 graph features to be investigated in goodness of fit diagnostics, covering a variety of important network properties including density, reciprocity, geodesic distributions, degree distributions, and various forms of closure. As empirical illustrations, we develop models for two sets of organizational network data: a trust network within a training group, and a work difficulty network within a government instrumentality.

Identifying Significant Facilitators of Dark Network Evolution,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Apr 2009,2009,"Social networks evolve over time with the addition and removal of nodes and links to survive and thrive in their environments. Previous studies have shown that the link-formation process in such networks is Influenced by a set of facilitators. However, there have been few empirical evaluations to determine the important facilitators. In a research partnership with law enforcement agencies, we used dynamic social-network analysis methods to examine several plausible facilitators of co-offending relationships in a large-scale narcotics network consisting of individuals and vehicles. Multivariate Cox regression and a two-proportion z-test on cyclic and focal closures of the network showed that mutual acquaintance and vehicle affillations were significant facilitators for the network under study. We also found that homophily with respect to age, race, and gender were not good predictors of future link formation in these networks. Moreover, we examined the social causes and policy implications for the significance and insignificance of various facilitators including common jails on future co-offending. These findings provide Important Insights into the link-formation processes and the resilience of social networks. In addition, they can be used to aid In the prediction of future links. The methods described can also help in understanding the driving forces behind the formation and evolution of social networks facilitated by mobile and Web technologies.",
The Simultaneous Effect of Social Distance and Physical Distance on the Formation of Neighborhood Ties,CITY & COMMUNITY,Mar 2009,2009,"Prior studies have separately suggested the importance of physical distance or social distance effects for the creation of neighborhood ties. This project adopts a case study approach and simultaneously tests for propinquity and homophily effects on neighborhood ties by employing a full-network sample from a recently developed New Urbanist neighborhood within a mid-sized southern city. The authors find that physical distance reduces the likelihood of weak or strong ties forming, suggesting the importance of accounting for propinquity when estimating social tie formation. The authors simultaneously find that social distance along wealth reduces the likelihood of weak ties forming. Social distance on life course markers-age, marital status, and the presence of children-reduces the formation of weak ties. Consistent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties. An important innovation is this study's ability to directly compare the effects of physical distance and social distance, placing them into equivalent units: a 10 percent increase in home value difference is equivalent to a 5.6 percent increase in physical distance.",
Ubiquitous collaborative iTrust service: Exploring proximity collective wisdom,INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS,Mar 2009,2009,"Ubiquitous e-service is one of the most recent links in the chain of evolution that has characterized the different eras of the internetworking environment. In order to leap the trust barrier for the users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, we present a collaborative iTrust e-service for exploring proximal collective wisdom in the ad-hoc ubiquitous environment. By highlighting the homophily of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. Proximity thus enables ad-hoc e-service participants to contribute their strength for ubiquitous collective wisdom. Simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show significant improvement over traditional designs. The iTrust e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with the nearby user groups for establishing a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. It also facilitates and empowers the potential benefits of various ubiquitous e-service applications.",
It Takes Two: The Interplay of Individual and Group Theology on Social Embeddedness,JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION,Mar 2009,2009,"Prior research argues that religious homophily in social networks is a product of overlapping interests and activities unintentionally leading to relationships or the intentional seeking of relationships with people of similar religious beliefs. This article advances research on religious homophily by including the role that exclusive theological beliefs play in explaining religious homophily among friends. We lay out three propositions for individual-, congregational-, and cross-level effects on the relationship between exclusive theology and embeddedness within one's congregation. Using multilevel models and data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (USCLS), we find support for our three propositions. We discuss our findings in terms of how exclusive theologies may contribute to bonding forms of social capital, but limit exposure to diverse social perspectives and bridging forms of social capital.",
CAN COGNITIVE BIASES EXPLAIN VENTURE TEAM HOMOPHILY?,STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL,Mar 2009,2009,"Although venture teams whose founders are dissimilar (heterophilious) tend to outperform teams whose founders are similar (homophilious), most new venture teams are characterized by homophily. I try to explain this puzzle with a learning model in which founders are prone to two cognitive biases: overoptimism and self-serving attributions. Founders choose cofounders with similar beliefs as themselves because they expect this to promote the most effective allocation of effort to the venture. Self-serving bias reinforces and perpetuates these beliefs. In principle, informed outsiders (e.g., practitioners or hands on investors) can improve venture team composition compared with private choices by founders.

Homophily in MySpace,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Feb 2009,2009,"Social network sites like MySpace are increasingly important environments for expressing and maintaining interpersonal connections, but does online communication exacerbate or ameliorate the known tendency for offline friendships to form between similar people (homophily)? This article reports an exploratory study of the similarity between the reported attributes of pairs of active MySpace Friends based upon a systematic sample of 2,567 members joining on June 18, 2007 and Friends who commented on their profile. The results showed no evidence of gender homophily but significant evidence of homophily for ethnicity, religion, age, country, marital status, attitude towards children, sexual orientation, and reason for joining MySpace. There were also some imbalances: women and the young were disproportionately commenters, and commenters tended to have more Friends than commentees. Overall, it seems that although traditional sources of homophily are thriving in MySpace networks of active public connections, gender homophily has completely disappeared. Finally, the method used has wide potential for investigating and partially tracking homophily in society, providing early warning of socially divisive trends.",
Parsing Social Network Survey Data from Hidden Populations Using Stochastic Context-Free Grammars,Figshare,2016-01-14,2009,"BackgroundHuman populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e.g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits.ConclusionsSCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.",

The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide,Figshare,2016-01-13,2009,"The observation that suicides sometimes cluster in space and/or time has led to suggestions that these clusters are caused by the social learning of suicide-related behaviours, or copycat suicides. Point clusters are clusters of suicides localised in both time and space, and have been attributed to direct social learning from nearby individuals. Mass clusters are clusters of suicides localised in time but not space, and have been attributed to the dissemination of information concerning celebrity suicides via the mass media. Here, agent-based simulations, in combination with scan statistic methods for detecting clusters of rare events, were used to clarify the social learning processes underlying point and mass clusters. It was found that social learning between neighbouring agents did generate point clusters as predicted, although this effect was partially mimicked by homophily (individuals preferentially assorting with similar others). The one-to-many transmission dynamics characterised by the mass media were shown to generate mass clusters, but only where social learning was weak, perhaps due to prestige bias (only copying prestigious celebrities) and similarity bias (only copying similar models) acting to reduce the subset of available models. These findings can help to clarify and formalise existing hypotheses and to guide future empirical work relating to real-life copycat suicides.",

TUNES THAT BIND? Predicting friendship strength in a music-based social network,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,2009,2009,"Despite the popularity of social network sites based on common interests, the association between these shared interests and relational development is not well understood. This manuscript reports results of an empirical investigation of interpersonal relationships on Last. fm, amusic-based social network site with a multinational user base. In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last. fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last. fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last. fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development. Rather, following media multiplexity theory, relational development is strongly and uniquely associated with communication behavior across almost all forms of communication (including Last. fm). These results suggest that shared interests may foster the creation of weak ties, but conversion of these connections to strong ties is relatively rare.",

User Age Profile Assessment Using SMS Network Neighbors' Age Profiles,"2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED INFORMATION NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS WORKSHOPS: WAINA, VOLS 1 AND 2",2009,2009,"Customer profile data used in information systems such as recommender systems and collaborative customer relationship management system should be reliable. However, it is hard to maintain high quality of customer profile data because profile information is usually self-reported by users who do not always want to throw their profiles to the company. This paper presents a study of user profile reliability assessment using homophily in a large-scale mobile SMS (short messaging service) data. Our research provides a simple statistical method to find out users' true profiles based on profile information of users' neighbors in social network. Our dataset contains randomly selected 117,333 user data from a larg Korean mobile company, including users' demographic profiles and their text communication histories. Using the text network data, we construct social network. Results show that our method efficiently identifies users with great discrepancy between reported age and actual age. In particular, the prediction accuracy for a user's actual age by our method is 94.4% which is very high compared to 86.5%, the second best accuracy by the simple relational inference approach. The results imply that our age profile assessment model can verify whether a user's age profile is reliable or not and can be applied in practical use.",
Educational Assortative Marriage in Comparative Perspective,ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY,2009,2009,"Most studies of assortative marriage still rely on cross-sectional data and apply log-linear modeling of the contingency table of wives' and husbands' educational levels. However, these macro studies have provided quite ambiguous findings and interpretations. In comparison, the life course approach analyzes single individuals over the life course and explicitly recognizes the dynamic nature of partner decisions and the importance of educational roles and institutional circumstances. Based on life course studies, educational homogamy seems to be driven by three factors: (a) Individuals often prefer to associate with equally educated partners; (b) educational expansion increases contact opportunities for equally educated men and women at an age when young people start to look for partners and form couples; and (c) women's changing economic role in dual-earner societies increases the importance of women's education and labor force attachment.",
Identification of Social Tension in Organizational Networks Relating Clan/Clique Formation to Social Tension,COMPLEX NETWORKS,2009,2009,"Analysis of email networks reveals properties similar to classic social networks such as homophily (assortativity) and community formation. The technology underlying email enables the formation of a network but it does not explain characteristics of the network that occur only as a result of patterns in human social behavior. Accordingly, a network formed from email activity correlates to the social environment and the dynamics of the environment used to create the network. Furthermore, the overall social behavior observed in an organization may be attributed directly to the organization's strength and resilience. When an organization is in trouble, we observe social tension among its employees. That being the case, one should be able to discern this tension by examining properties of a social network of the employees-the network should reflect the employees' mood; the fears, worries, gossips that are circulating, the good and the bad, are all reflected in organization's social network. One of the best representations of the true social organizational social network can be constructed from email exchange. The issue we investigate in this paper relates to timing: when does the network exhibits social tension when it is known to be present in the organization? In this paper, we provide a temporal analysis of the email social network constructed for the Enron Corporation and show that changes in network characteristics strongly correlate to real-world events in that organization. More importantly, we show that this correlation is time-shifted and appears in the network before the event becomes common knowledge; our hypothesis is that we can use the anomalies in the network to identify social tension in the organization and consequently help mitigate its consequences.",

The current study seeks to uncover whether traditional findings on social ties and WOM communication hold for eWOM information.Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 482 college students with varying levels of expertise with eWOM forums, specifically RateMyProfessors.com in the USA. Participants completed a 20-question survey related to university professor and class choice.Findings - The study finds that students seeking information on which professor to take weight the information they obtain from eWOM forums to be equally influential in their decision as their own primary experience with the professor. Furthermore, the information gained from the eWOM forum is more influential in their decision than speaking with friends in person (WOM). While existing research suggests that strong tie referral sources are more influential than weak tie information sources on decision making, this research finds that some weak tie information sources are rated as more influential.Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the study is the focus on one eWOM forum, RateMyProfessors.com. Future research would benefit from expanding the number and type of eWOM forums.Originality/value - While the emergence of the Internet and social networking has spawned an interest in the overall study of eWOM, this study is the first to evaluate eWOM in the context of tie strength, homophily and decision making. The study also investigates whether existing theories of interpersonal communication hold in an online context.",
Ubiquitous proximity e-service for trust collaboration,INTERNET RESEARCH,2009,2009,"Purpose - The authors seek to propose the notion of ubiquitous proximity e-service for exploring collective wisdom in the ubiquitous environment. Ubiquitous proximity e-service highlights the collective effort focused on collecting the user group's power as the reference for ubiquitous trust decisions.Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides some theoretical utility support for ubiquitous proximity e-service. The ""homophily"" describes the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others. By highlighting the ""homophily"" of e-service participants, these isolated individuals can be treated as a group with proximity. The main value of ubiquitous proximity e-service utilizes the network effect from the collective effort of interpersonal social network.Findings - In order to leap the trust barrier for users to embrace these ubiquitous e-services, ubiquitous proximity e-service makes it possible for users to collaborate with their nearby user groups to establish a reliable and trustworthy interaction environment. The simulation outcomes for trust decision quality enhancement show a significant improvement in a variety of environment settings.Practical implications - A significant value of ubiquitous proximity e-service lies in the increased possibility of establishing innovative social network relationships. From the interpersonal perspective, unfamiliar strangers can make connections with individuals who are proximal and homoplastic to them. The strength of proximity gives people better chances to make interpersonal connections, including both weak ties and strong ties. By combining those interpersonal tie relationships, ubiquitous proximity e-service can easily cause information diffusion and effectively encourage collective wisdom.Originality/value - The paper advocates the utility of ubiquitous proximity e-service that can be realized in the e-commerce environment and which enables information diffusion effectively.",
"A Study on the Emotional Identification in  TV Drama Viewing : Relationships among Homophily, Viewing Motives,  and Viewing Satisfaction",Korean Journal of Broadcasting and Telecommunication Studies,2009,2009,"This study examined the effect of emotional identification on the following variables: homophily, viewing motives, and viewing satisfaction. The study results are: First, the emotional identification was influenced by internal homophily like attitude or values, but external homophilylike appearance or background had no influence on the emotional identification. Second, the results of the factor analysis showed that viewing motives of TV drama were composed of eight factors, such as ‘information/culture,’ ‘homophily,’ ‘escape,’ ‘habit,’ ‘companionship/conversation,’ ‘family relations,’ ‘loneliness,’ and ‘amusement.’ Using regression analysis, the study found that escape and homophily were the strongest predictors of emotional identification and habit, information/culture, amusement motives were also positively related to emotional identification. This result suggested that various viewing motives had different power of influence on emotional identification. Third, using path analysis, the study found that homophily and viewing motives were positive predictors of emotional identification, and emotionalidentification had an affirmative effect on viewing satisfaction. In addition, homophily and viewing motives had both direct and indirect effect on viewing satisfaction. Consequently, emotional identification was an important predictor of viewing satisfaction.",
Coauthorship Patterns in Korean Public Administrative Review (1989-2008),Korean Public Administration Review,2009,2009,"The authors strive to identify coauthorship patterns from a social relationship perspective, rather than a rationalistic one. A total number of 294 co-authored articles are analyzed which appeared in the Korean Public Administrative Review over the past 20 years (Volume 23 Issue 1, 1989 to Volume 42 Issue 4), in terms of subjects, gender, affiliation, region, and mentorship. The findings are that coauthorship is made by authors with different affiliations, in the same regions (especially Seoul), coauthoring is dominant among university professors, that there is a steady growth in coauthoring activity between teachers and students, and coauthoring is androcratic with a very high propensity to coauthor among females. These findings suggest that homophily prevails in gender, mentorship, locations, and types of affiliated institutions, while heterophily is in affiliated institutions.",
Relational Approach on the Structure of Trust Network and the Exchange of Social Resources among Soccer Club Members,Korean Society for the Sociology of Sport,2009,2009,"This study is to explore the structure of trust network, and analyze the relationship between degree centrality, betweenness centrality, power, ego network size, constraint and the exchange of social resourcewithin social network by applying social network analysis. This study selected 34 members of B soccer club doing in playground of S elementary school located in Seoul using the purposive sampling method. Theresearch method utilized general social survey of NGQ(name generator question) and in-depth interview. To analyze data, NetMiner 3.0 and SNA(social network analysis) were used. The conclusion based on abovestudy method and the result of material analysis are here below. First, the trust network of soccer club show up homophily phenomenon structured various groups, and exist openly, closely groups. Homophilyphenomenon showed up 'a buddy from my old stomping grounds', 'exercise mania', 'social drinker','insufficiency in motor ability', 'isolated' groups. Openly groups are 'a buddy from my old stomping grounds','exercise mania', 'social drinker', the other side closely groups are 'insufficiency in motor ability', 'isolated' groups. Leaders of openly groups are very high in degree centrality, betweenness centrality, power, egonetwork size. Leaders of closely groups are very high in constraints by being dependent on brokerage. Second, the trust network of soccer club is bound up with the exchange of social resource. Namely, the more degree centrality and power is high, the more members are of great advantage to exchange of informational resource. The more betweenness centrality is high, the more members are of great advantage to exchange of social and informational resource. The more ego network size is great, the more members are of greatadvantage to exchange of social resource.",
"The Effect of Image Features on Judgments of Homophily, Credibility, and Intention to Use as Avatars in Future Interactions",MEDIA PSYCHOLOGY,2009,2009,"Avatar characteristics influence the perception of the people they represent in a process that is remarkably similar to the way physical bodies influence person perception offline. This is consistent with the Social Responses to Computer Technologies model, which argues that people respond similarly to computers and people as long as sources are perceived to be intelligent. Similarly, Information Processing Theory suggests that the viewers apply the same evaluation sequences to nearly all sources and that more processing resources are allocated to perceiving an entity with social potential. To address the extent to which static avatars are perceived to be intelligent and human like, or have social potential, participants (N = 261) each evaluated a random set of 10 images as potential avatars. The avatars varied with respect to level of computer manipulation, visible indicators of masculinity, and anthropomorphism (having human characteristics). Results confirm that even static avatars are anthropomorphized and that visual characteristics influence perceptions of the avatars. Level of computer manipulation, masculinity, and anthropomorphism all influence perceived levels of realism, competence, and the sense of homophily with the avatar. The implications of these results for theory, future research, and for users and designers of communication systems are discussed.",
Social Network Analysis on Data Diffusion in Delay Tolerant Networks,MOBIHOC'09 PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOBILE AD HOC NETWORKING AND COMPUTING,2009,2009,"Different from existing mobility-assisted data access techniques, we propose to use data diffusion to reduce the query delay in DTNs. We use social network analysis to classify and study four diffusion schemes based on the ""homophily"" phenomenon in social network. Theoretical models are further developed to analyze the data diffusion process and compare the performance of the four proposed diffusion schemes in terms of diffusion speed and query delay.",
The formation and development of co-operations among South African universities,HIGHER EDUCATION,Dec 2008,2008,"Organizational collaboration is ""en vogue"", especially in higher education. So far, little is known about the mechanisms that explain co-operation formation and their impact on the social structure of the research systems. By examining co-authored research papers written at South African universities between 1966 and 2006, co-operation structures are visualized and analyzed from a social network perspective. Regression analysis indicates that status homophily and geographical proximity help to explain attachment processes among universities. Policy makers looking to overcome the steep status hierarchies among South African institutions of higher education need to provide incentives for establishing a stronger research culture in previously disadvantaged institutions. This will enhance their attractiveness for co-operation with reputable organizations and contribute to more equality among institutions.",
A Preference-Opportunity-Choice Framework with Applications to Intergroup Friendship,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Nov 2008,2008,"A long-standing objective of friendship research is to identify the effects of personal preference and structural opportunity on intergroup friendship choice. Although past studies have used various methods to separate preference from opportunity, researchers have not yet systematically compared the properties and implications of these methods. This study puts forward a general framework for discrete choice, where choice probability is specified as proportional to the product of preference and opportunity. To implement this framework, the authors propose a modification to the conditional logit model for estimating preference parameters free from the influence of opportunity structure and then compare this approach to several alternative methods for separating preference and opportunity used in the friendship choice literature. As an empirical example, the authors test hypotheses of homophily and status asymmetry in friendship choice using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The example also demonstrates the approach of conducting a sensitivity analysis to examine how parameter estimates vary by specification of the opportunity structure.",
Population Heterogeneity and Individual Differences in an Assortative Agent-Based Marriage and Divorce Model (MADAM) Using Search with Relaxing Expectations,JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION,Oct 2008,2008,"While many models have investigated the role of competitive mate selection processes in human marriage, few have addressed the potential for assortative processes to explain the observed demographics, as well as simultaneously investigating divorce. To explore the possibility that assortative mate selection processes may explain patterns of both marriage and divorce, we developed an agent-based model, MADAM (Marriage and Divorce Annealing Model), based on homophilic trait matching, in which individuals search for mates similar to themselves, but relax these expectations as they age. MADAM assumes individuals live in a world with N mate-relevant traits, where each individual chooses a set of k traits from those N to represent his or her identity. Individuals seek marriage partners with some number of identical traits, but over time relax their expectations for this desired threshold number of matching traits. Divorce is allowed when individuals find a partner who shares more traits with them than their current partner. With this implementation, we explored how population heterogeneity and individual differences affect population-level demographic trends, finding that increasing population heterogeneity and a reduction in the rate of relaxing expectations can both increase the mean age at first marriage. MADAM also accurately predicts demographic marriage and divorce data across cultures, with quantitatively accurate predictions for length of first marriage, likelihood of first marriage ending in divorce, and percent of population married by the end of the lifespan.",
Dating in the fast lane: How communication predicts speed-dating success,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,Oct 2008,2008,"Speed-dating has become a popular way to initiate relationships; however, little scholarly research has focused on these events. This research is designed to investigate positive and negative predictors of possible relationships by focusing on decisions to engage in future dates. Interpersonal attraction, homophily, and nonverbal immediacy have been linked to the predicted outcome value (POV) of relationships during initial encounters. This study investigates how these variables influence date decisions in a six minute speed-dating experience. Results indicate interpersonal attraction and nonverbal immediacy significantly predict POV but not future date decisions. Moreover, men reported higher levels of homophily and interpersonal attraction than women. Differential elements of speed-dating as an initial interaction context and the relevance of demographics are discussed.",
Navigating networks by using homophily and degree,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Sep 2 2008,2008,"Many large distributed systems can be characterized as networks where short paths exist between nearly every pair of nodes. These include social, biological, communication, and distribution networks, which often display power-law or small-world structure. A central challenge of distributed systems is directing messages to specific nodes through a sequence of decisions made by individual nodes without global knowledge of the network. We present a probabilistic analysis of this navigation problem that produces a surprisingly simple and effective method for directing messages. This method requires calculating only the product of the two measures widely used to summarize all local information. It outperforms prior approaches reported in the literature by a large margin, and it provides a formal model that may describe how humans make decisions in sociological studies intended to explore the social network as well as how they make decisions in more naturalistic settings.",
Investigating the Microstructure of Network Evolution: Alliance Formation in the Mobile Communications Industry,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,SEP-OCT 2008,2008,"Theories of network evolution frequently focus on ""network endogeneity,"" which stresses predictable, path-dependent evolution rooted in previous network structure. However, theories of technological evolution and innovation remind us that networks may undergo significant change as technological discontinuities exert pressures on existing relationships and firms engage in exploratory search. How can we incorporate sources of change into our theories of network evolution instead of focusing so squarely on sources of inertia? By using recent advances in graph theory, we develop a more flexible theory of network evolution by examining two patterns of partner selection that have the potential to change networks: ""shortcut"" formation between relatively unconnected partner clusters, and the entry of new firms into the "" main component"" of incumbent partners. Our findings suggest an important contingency for the endogeneity perspective: structural homophily predicts shortcut formation but not alliance formation within clusters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pattern of alliance formation between incumbents and new entrants to the alliance network is driven by a combination of endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. New entrants attach to more prominent incumbents, but they are more likely to attach with an alliance deal that comprises multiple partners. We demonstrate these findings in an industry where systemic technology encourages cooperation and where network entry is prevalent - the mobile communications industry from 1993-2002.",

How social is social responses to computers? The function of the degree of anthropomorphism in computer representations,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Jul 2008,2008,"Testing the assumption that more anthropomorphic (human-like) computer representations elicit more social responses from people, a between-participants experiment (N = 168) manipulated 12 computer agents to represent four levels of anthropomorphism: low, medium, high, and real human images. Social responses were assessed with users' social judgment and homophily perception of the agents, conformity in a choice dilemma task, and competency and trustworthiness ratings of the agents. Linear polynomial trend analyses revealed significant linear trends for almost all the measures. As the agent became more anthropomorphic to being human, it received more social responses from users.

Modeling homophily over time with an actor-partner interdependence model,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Jul 2008,2008,"Selection and socialization have been implicated in friendship homophily, but the relative contributions of each are difficult to measure simultaneously because of the nonindependent nature of the data. To address this problem, the authors applied a multiple-groups longitudinal actor-partner interdependence model (D. A. Kashy & D. A. Kenny, 2000) for distinguishable dyads to 3 consecutive years of intoxication frequency data from a large community-based sample of Swedish youth. Participants, ranging from 12 to 18 years old (M = 14.35, SD = 1.56) at the start of the study, included 902 adolescents (426 girls and 476 boys) with at least one reciprocated friend during at least one time point and 212 adolescents (84 girls and 128 boys) without reciprocated friends at any time. Similarity estimates indicated strong effects for selection and socialization in friends' intoxication frequency. Over time, younger members of these dyads had less stable patterns of intoxication than older members, largely because younger partners changed their drinking behavior to resemble that of older partners.",
"Health information, credibility, homophily, and influence via the Internet: Web sites versus discussion groups",HEALTH COMMUNICATION,JUL-AUG 2008,2008,"Despite concerns about online health information and efforts to improve its credibility, how users evaluate and utilize such information presented in Web sites and online discussion groups may involve different evaluative mechanisms. This study examined credibility and homophily as two underlying mechanisms for social influence with regard to online health information. An original experiment detected that homophily grounded credibility perceptions and drove the persuasive process in both Web sites and online discussion groups. The more homophilous an online health information stimulus was perceived as being, the more likely people were to adopt the advice offered in that particular piece of information.",
Coevolutionary networks with homophily and heterophily,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Jul 2008,2008,"We have investigated a simple coevolutionary network model incorporating three processes-changes of opinions, homophily, and heterophily. In this model, each node holds one of G opinions and changes its opinion, as in the voter model. Homophily is the tendency for connections to form between individuals of the same opinions and heterophily is the opposite effect. If there is no heterophily, this model corresponds to the Holme and Newman model [Phys. Rev. E 74, 056108 (2006)]. We show that the behavior of this model without heterophily can be understood in terms of a mean field approximation. We also find that this model with heterophily exhibits topologically complicated behaviors such as the small-world property.",
Social capital and employee well-being: disentangling intrapersonal and interpersonal selection and influence mechanisms,REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE,JUL-SEP 2008,2008,"We argue that sociological explanations proposed within the social capital framework to explain individual well-being are incomplete because they do not differentiate between interpersonal influence and selection mechanisms, on the one hand, and cognitive intra-personal processes. on the other. To this end. three theoretical models of the dynamic interaction between interpersonal trust and job satisfaction will be used to derive and empirically test six hypotheses. First, according to influence mechanisms, an individual's job satisfaction can be the result of the number of sociometric trust choices he or she receives (popularity effect) or the level of job satisfaction of those actors he/she trusts (contagion effect). Second, selection mechanisms postulate that a focal actor will be more likely to develop interpersonal trust in colleagues with a high job satisfaction (attractiveness effect) or with similar levels of job satisfaction as the focal actor (homophily effect). Third, according to intrapersonal spillover mechanisms, a high level of job satisfaction can either facilitate the creation of interpersonal trust relationships (satisfaction spillover effect), or individuals initiating a high number of interpersonal trust relationships can exhibit higher levels of satisfaction (trust spillover effect). To simultaneously test these six hypotheses, longitudinal intra-organizational social network data from a Dutch housing company (n = 57) were used. We found a significant contagion effect, but no support for a popularity effect or either selection effect. Moreover, contrary to what we expected, employees with a low level of job satisfaction were significantly more likely to develop trust relationships with others.",
Gender and homophily: Differences in male and female association in Blau space,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Jun 2008,2008,"Homophily, the tendency for similar individuals to associate, is one of the most robust findings in social science. Despite this robustness, we have less information about how personal characteristics relate to differences in the strength of homophily. Nor do we know much about the impact of personal characteristics on judgments of relative dissimilarity. The present study compares the strength of age, religious, and educational homophily for male and female non-kin ties using network data from the 1985 General Social Survey. It also compares the patterning of ties among dissimilar alters for both sexes. The results of this exploratory effort indicate that males and females are almost equally homophilous, although religious homophily exerts a stronger influence on females than males. Males and females do, however, differ in their tendency to associate with certain types of dissimilar alters. Education is essentially uniform for both sexes, religious difference is more important for females than males, and those over sixty or under thirty are less different from the middle categories of age for females than for males. The results suggest that males are able to bridge larger areas of social space in their non-kin interpersonal networks and likely accumulate greater social capital as a consequence.

VALUES AND JUDGMENT UNDER UNCERTAINTY: EVIDENCE FROM VENTURE CAPITALIST ASSESSMENTS OF FOUNDERS,STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL,Jun 2008,2008,"We examine how judgments in the context of uncertainty vary, depending on the values of those making these judgments. We test these ideas in the context of venture capitalists' (VCs') evaluations of founders. Drawing on theoretical and empirical research on the role of values in judgment and decision making and on Schwartz's (1992, 1996) conceptualization of the basic motivational dimensions underlying human values, we hypothesize and find that decision makers' process values (i.e., values governing the types of means to an end that an individual values) influence the perceived worth of founders' human capital. We discuss implications of these findings for judgment and decision-making research, as well as practical implications for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.

"Girls' cognitions of hypothetical friends: Are they related to depression, loneliness, social anxiety and perceived similarity?",JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,Apr 2008,2008,"We examined in 100 girls whether girls' depression, loneliness, social anxiety, and perceived similarity were related to their cognitions of hypothetical friends (prosocial, withdrawn/depressed, and aggressive). Depression, loneliness, and social anxiety were each related to various friend-related cognitions, but only social anxiety and loneliness had unique relations when these three internalizing problems were examined simultaneously and with perceived similarity. After accounting for the three internalizing constructs, perceived similarity was related to higher wanting to be friends with and perceived acceptance from all three hypothetical friends, lower not wanting aggressive girls as friends, and lower expected rejection by prosocial girls. Findings highlight the importance of perceived similarity, and the importance of examining depression, loneliness, and social anxiety simultaneously, when assessing girls' friendship-related cognitions.",
"Gender, body size and social relations in American high schools",SOCIAL FORCES,Mar 2008,2008,"To investigate the role of body size in social networks, this study estimated cross-nested multilevel network models (p) with longitudinal data from the 16 saturated schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As body mass index increased, the likelihood of being nominated by schoolmates as friends - but not the likelihood of nominating others as friends decreased. This trend was more pronounced among girls. Moreover, similarity in body mass index strongly predicted friendship formation. These findings were not explained by correlates (e.g., academic achievement) of both body size and friendship dynamics. Thus, the connection between body size and high school social relations was largely a function of the stigmatization of heavier body sizes, especially for girls, and of homophily.",
How to get the timing right. A computational model of the effects of the timing of contacts on team cohesion in demographically diverse teams,COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ORGANIZATION THEORY,Mar 2008,2008,"Lau and Murnighan's faultline theory explains negative effects of demographic diversity on team performance as consequence of strong demographic faultlines. If demographic differences between group members are correlated across various dimensions, the team is likely to show a ""subgroup split"" that inhibits communication and effective collaboration between team members. Our paper proposes a rigorous formal and computational reconstruction of the theory. Our model integrates four elementary mechanisms of social interaction, homophily, heterophobia, social influence and rejection into a computational representation of the dynamics of both opinions and social relations in the team. Computational experiments demonstrate that the central claims of faultline theory are consistent with the model. We show furthermore that the model highlights a new structural condition that may give managers a handle to temper the negative effects of strong demographic faultlines. We call this condition the timing of contacts. Computational analyses reveal that negative effects of strong faultlines critically depend on who is when brought in contact with whom in the process of social interactions in the team. More specifically, we demonstrate that faultlines have hardly negative effects when teams are initially split into demographically homogeneous subteams that are merged only when a local consensus has developed.",
The impact of offshored and outsourced call service centers on customer appraisals,MARKETING LETTERS,Mar 2008,2008,"Firms are increasingly relying upon offshored and/or outsourced call centers to provide post-sales assistance to their customers. Although the motivation to engage in these practices is efficiency gains, the possibility exists that offshored and outsourced call centers may have a detrimental impact on customer appraisals. The aim of this research is to posit the conceptual reasons as to why differences may arise in customer evaluations from these practices. To this end, we rely on the homophily principle and hybrid organization theory to provide conceptual grounding, and utilize a company dataset of customer post-call evaluations to offer an initial test of the hypotheses.",
Why do faultlines matter? A computational model of how strong demographic faultlines undermine team cohesion,SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY,Feb 2008,2008,"Lau and Murnighan (LM) suggested that strong demographic faultlines threaten team cohesion and reduce consensus. However, it remains unclear which assumptions are exactly needed to derive faultline effects. We propose a formal computational model of the effects of faultlines that uses four elementary social mechanisms, social influence, rejection, homophily and heterophobia. We show that our model is consistent with the central hypotheses of LM's theory. We also find that negative effects of faultlines can be derived even when - unlike LM - we assume that initially there is no correlation between the demographic characteristics and the opinions of team members.

Social networks and health,ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY,2008,2008,"People are interconnected, and so their health is interconnected. In recognition of this social fact, there has been growing conceptual and empirical attention over the past decade to the impact of social networks on health. This article reviews prominent findings from this literature. After drawing a distinction between social network studies and social support studies, we explore current research on dyadic and supradyadic network influences on health, highlighting findings from both egocentric and sociocentric analyses. We then discuss the policy implications of this body of work, as well as future research directions. We conclude that the existence of social networks means that people's health is interdependent and that health and health care can transcend the individual in ways that patients, doctors, policy makers, and researchers should care about.",
"Social Capital, Institutional Structure and the Stability of Inter-firm Trading Relationships in China’s Automobile Industry",International Business Journal,2008,2008,"This study highlights the distinctiveness of emerging economic order in post- socialist China through illuminating institutional legacies of the past state socialism on structuring economic relations of the transitional present. Utilizing data on supply relations between 32 major Chinese automakers and 477 parts and components suppliers during the period of 1998 to 2005, this study finds that while social capital benefits that have been highlighted by previous studies as important drivers of stable exchange structure do tend to promote stable relationship between the automakers and parts suppliers, institutional homophily, that is, the similarity of each firm’s affiliation within the previous administrative structure of the state socialism, also tend to have strong influence on the tendency of firms to repeat its previous relationships. The tendency of firms sharing similar institutional affiliations to continue its formal ties, the tendency that I termed as “institutional inertia,” tended to be stronger for state-controlled firms formally affiliated with the machinery system which were in charge of the industry within the planned economic system, whereas relation-specific factors such as asset specificity had more significant effect on relational structure of relatively newcomer automakers which were either privately owned or state-controlled firms with different affiliational background from those who formerly controlled the industry.",

Changing Faces of Network Capitalism in Korea: A Case of Corporate Board of Directors’ Network,Korean Journal of Sociology,2008,2008,"The concept of network capitalism among scholars was coined to capture uniquecharacteristics of East Asian market (Gerlarch and Lincoln 1992; Biggart and Hamilton1992). The goal of this paper is to examine the changing faces of network capitalism in Koreaafter the economic crisis in 1997 particularly focusing on the composition of corporate boardof directors. Our research questions are: (1) Has the “homophily” rule of group compositiondominant in the boardroom prior to the economic crisis shifted to “functional” rule after theeconomic crisis?; (2) What types of firms, if any, rely on homophily more heavily than others?Major findings of our paper are summarized as the following. First, corporate boardrooms inKorea are still dominated by directors who graduated from top-tier high schools anduniversities. We also have observed high levels of concentration of directors representingspecific schools and regions. The analyses of inequality of high school, college, and regionmeasured by Gini indices and their dominance ratios show that a strong “homophily” effectsstill operate in the boardroom of Korean firms throughout the observed period. Second, thehomogeneity of board members began to decline before the economic crisis, but it increased asfirms overcome financial difficulties. Third, larger firms tend to have a higher level ofheterogeneity in the boards of directors. Older firms also have lower level of homophily in theboard. And lastly, debt ratio has the significant and positive relationships with all threedominance ratios.",
The influence of network structure on trust: Addressing the interconnectedness of network principles and trust in communities of practice,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT,2008,2008,"In this paper we explore the emergence of trusting relationships within Communities of Practice. It has been argued that trust can be viewed as an organizing principle (McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer, 2003). However, we focus on the view that trust is an essential pre-condition for the sharing of knowledge. The goal of the paper is to discuss possible connections between social networking principles, network structure, and trust within Communities of Practice.In the paper we define and subsequently analyze the concept of trust and develop arguments relating to the existence and strength of trusting relationships within Communities of Practice. The theoretical arguments propose relationships between the characteristics of trusting relationships and two network characteristics: homophily and closure. The general research question that underpins this paper is:To what extent do network principles determine the level of trust among members within a Community of Practice?It is important to note that in our analysis we focus on a specific type of social network which has been termed a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice have been argued to be critical elements in the creation, refinement and sharing of knowledge (Dugid, 2005; Wenger, 1998; Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder, 2002).",
Similarity or dissimilarity in the relations between human service organizations.,Social work in public health,2008,2008,"Exchange theory and homophily theory give rise to counteracting expectations for the interaction between human service organizations. Based on arguments of exchange theory, more interaction is expected between dissimilar organizations having complementary resources. Based on arguments of homophily theory, organizations having similar characteristics are expected to interact more. Interorganizational relations between human service organizations in two regional networks in Flanders are examined in this study. Results indicate that human service organizations tend to cooperate more with similar organizations as several homophily effects but not one effect of dissimilarity were found to be significant. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of interorganizational networks of human service organizations and have implications for the development of integrated care.",

"Do people mix at mixers? Structure, homophily, and the ""Life of the Party""",ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY,Dec 2007,2007,"We used electronic name tags to conduct a fine-grained analysis of the pattern of socializing dynamics at a mixer attended by about 100 business people, to examine whether individuals in such minimally structured social events can initiate new and different contacts, despite the tendency to interact with those they already know or who are similar to them. The results show that guests did not mix as much as might be expected in terms of making new contacts. They were much more likely to encounter their pre-mixer friends, even though they overwhelmingly stated before the event that their goal was to meet new people. At the same time, guests did mix in the sense of encountering others who were different from themselves in terms of sex, race, education, and job. There was no evidence of homophily ( attraction to similar others) in the average encounter, although it did operate for some guests at some points in the mixer. Results also revealed a phenomenon that we call ""associative homophily,"" in which guests were more likely to join and continue engagement with a group as long as it contained at least one other person of the same race as them. We consider the implications of these results for organizations and individuals seeking to develop their networks and for theories of network dynamics.",
"Homophily, cultural drift and the co-evolution of cultural groups",JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION,Dec 2007,2007,"Studies of cultural differentiation have shown that social mechanisms that normally lead to cultural convergence - homophily and influence - can also explain how distinct cultural groups can form. However, this emergent cultural diversity has proven to be unstable in the face of cultural drift - small errors or innovations that allow cultures to change from within. The authors develop a model of cultural differentiation that combines the traditional mechanisms of homophily and influence with a third mechanism of network homophily, in which network structure co-evolves with cultural interaction. Results show that in certain regions of the parameter space, these co-evolutionary dynamics can lead to patterns of cultural diversity that are stable in the presence of cultural drift. The authors address the implications of these findings for understanding the stability of cultural diversity in the face of increasing technological trends toward globalization.",
Same-gender and cross-gender peer acceptance and peer rejection and their relation to bullying and helping among preadolescents: Comparing predictions from gender-homophily and goal-framing approaches,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2007,2007,"The relation between bullying and helping and same-gender and cross-gender peer acceptance and peer rejection was examined in a sample of preadolescents aged 11 and 12 years (N = 1,065). The authors tested predictions from a gender-homophily approach vs. predictions from a goal-framing approach in which acceptance and rejection are seen as being generated by approach and avoidance goals, respectively. For preadolescents, both approaches predicted a central role for gender, but the gender-homophily approach predicted symmetrical effects for acceptance and rejection, whereas the goal-framing approach predicted strong asymmetries. The data supported the goal-framing approach. The most important findings were that for preadolescents, acceptance is much more frequent and much more gendered than rejection; the absolute impact of helping on acceptance is much larger than that of bullying (and vice versa for rejection); for acceptance, there is a prototypicality effect (i.e., boys accept bullying girls better than nonbullying girls, and girls accept helping boys better than nonhelping boys); and for acceptance, there is a cross-gender ignorance effect (i.e., boys ignore helping in girls, and girls ignore bullying in boys).",
Ties that bind? Race and networks in job turnover,SOCIAL PROBLEMS,Nov 2007,2007,"This article seeks to clarify the role of race and social networks in job turnover. Analyses using the personnel records of roughly 300 entry level workers in a private organization investigate the extent to which social networks in the job attainment process affect turnover Specifically, I examine what occurs when the social network contact is from inside versus outside of the company, when the contact is white or minority and when a contact and applicant share a race or when they do not. Referrals from current employee contacts reduce voluntary turnover while referrals from nonemployees do not provide a turnover advantage. White and minority contacts yield similar levels of job turnover and both generate lower levels of turnover than noncontacts, a finding that lends partial support to social capital theory. Finally, I find modest support for homophily theory; compared to race-mismatched contact-applicant dyads, race-matched dyads have lower levels of voluntary turnover but similar levels of involuntary turnover The results illustrate the lasting effects of race-based social networks. I propose suggestions for designing research that can further our understanding of the mechanisms allegedly at work in the race, social network, and job turnover relationship.",
Norm-narrowing and self- and other-perceived aggression in early-adolescent same-sex and mixed-sex cliques,JOURNAL OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY,Oct 2007,2007,"We examined the relations between group context and self- and other-perceptions of aggressive behavior in an ethnically-diverse sample of 168 male and female grade 7 adolescents. We used self-and peer-reports of aggression in high- and average-aggressive mixed-sex and same-sex cliques to examine whether group members would assimilate their self-report of aggression to the aggression report of their peers by way of perceived homophily or, conversely, engage in contrast and see their level of aggression as comparatively low in the face of high-aggression peers. Among boys in mixed-sex groups, comparison with highly-aggressive others resulted in a self-perception of lower levels of aggression than those perceived by their peers. Conversely, girls in mixed-sex groups reported their own levels of aggression to be higher than those perceived by their peers. We interpret these findings in terms of the notion of ""norm narrowing"": rather than being set by the larger social environment, such as the school, norms are more narrowly determined within one's immediate peer group.

Interpersonal relationships and group A streptococcus spread in a Mexican day-care center,SALUD PUBLICA DE MEXICO,SEP-OCT 2007,2007,"Objective. To study the effect of different degrees of centrality on the carrying of identical group A streptococcus (GAS) clones in the nasopharynx of children from a Mexican public day-care center. Material and Methods. Nasopharyngeal cultures were performed in children from rooms B (RB) (n = 35) and C (RC) (n = 37). The Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) patterns were compared among GAS isolates. A social networks questionnaire was filled out for each child and 10 classmates. Structure coefficients were compared among children with and without GAS. Results. Four GAS clones were identified; clone I in five children from RC; clone I I in two from RC and one from RB; clone III in one from RB and one from RC; and clone IV in one from RC. Social network structure: Density of RB and RC = 0.40 (+/- 0.87) and 0.35 (+/- 0.80), respectively. In RB, the homophily pattern of interaction was different in carriers (0.00), non-carriers (0.47) and both (0.47) p = 0.35. In RC, the homophily pattern was also different in carriers (0.46), non-carriers (0.68) and mixed (0.19), p = .001. In 4/5 with clone I, the values of degree, closeness and betweenness were above the group mean. In 3/3 with clone II, the values of degree and betweenness were also above the mean. In contrast, in those with clone III and IV, the values of degree, closeness and betweenness were below the group mean. Conclusions. The spread of specific GAS clones was associated with groups of children having a high proportion of ties and a high centrality level. This is evidence that spread of GAS strains among children attending day-care centers is not random but dependent on the degree of communication and physical contact between pairs.",

Similarity and group performance,SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY,Sep 2007,2007,"This paper investigates the effects that different patterns of similarity among group members have on a group performance on a problem-solving task. I discuss and test hypotheses on the effects of similarity on group performance derived from two literatures: balance theory and research on homophily. In an experiment I found that the relative balance of the pattern of similarity was more important in predicting how quickly groups establish norms of interaction and complete a task than how similar group members were to each other Neither balance nor the degree of similarity had a significant effect on the quality of the groups' work. I conclude that groups with balanced similarity structures produce task solutions that approximate the quality of those from other groups, but they do so in significantly less time. That is, balanced groups are more efficient than unbalanced groups.",
Perceived peer influence and peer selection on adolescent smoking,ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS,Aug 2007,2007,"Despite advances in tobacco control, adolescent smoking remains a problem. The smoking status of friends is one of the highest correlates with adolescent smoking. This homophily (commonality of friends based on a given attribute) may be due to either peer pressure, where adolescents adopt the smoking behaviors of their friends, or peer selection, where adolescents choose friends based on their smoking status. This study used structural equation modeling to test a model of peer influence and peer selection on ever smoking by adolescents. The primary analysis of the model did not reach significance, but post hoc analyses did result in a model with good fit. Results indicated that both peer influence and peer selection were occurring, and that peer influence was more salient in the population than was peer selection. Implications of these results for tobacco prevention programs are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
"Friendship choices of multiracial adolescents: Racial homophily, blending, or amalgamation?",SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Jun 2007,2007,"Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we utilize the concepts of homophily, blending, and amalgamation to describe the possible friendship patterns of multiracials. Homophily Occurs when multiracials are most likely to choose other multiracials as friends. Blending occurs when friendship patterns of multiracials are somewhere in-between those of their monoracial counterparts. Amalgamation consists of friendship patterns that are similar to one of their monoracial counterparts. All groups exhibit signs of amalgamation such that non-white multiracials resemble Blacks, and White multiracials resemble whites except for Black-White multiracials. Black-Whites, Asian-Whites, and Asian-Blacks also exhibit signs of blending, while only Native American multiracials show signs of homophily. Multiracials have different experiences depending on their specific racial composition, and while they seem to bridge the distance between racial groups, their friendship patterns also fall along Black and White lines.

Order-disorder phase transition in a cliquey social network,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B,Jun 2007,2007,"We investigate the network model of community by Watts, Dodds and Newman (D.J. Watts et al., Science 296, 1302 (2002)) as a hierarchy of groups, each of 5 individuals. A homophily parameter alpha controls the probability proportional to exp (-alpha x) of selection of neighbours against distance x. The network nodes are endowed with spin-like variables s(i) = +/- 1, with Ising interaction J > 0. The Glauber dynamics is used to investigate the order-disorder transition. The transition temperature T-c is close to 3.8 for alpha M< 0.0 and it falls down to zero above this value. The result provides a mathematical illustration of the social ability to a collective action via weak ties, as discussed by Granovetter in 1973.",

Does gender matter? Women business angels and the supply of entrepreneurial finance,ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY AND PRACTICE,May 2007,2007,"There is a substantial literature on the relationship between gender and access to finance. However, most studies have been concerned with access to debt finance. More recently, the focus of this research has broadened to examine women and venture capital. This article extends the focus further by examining the role of women in the business angel market, which is more important than the formal venture capital market in terms of both the number of ventures supported and total capital flows. Based on a detailed analysis of business angels in the U.K., the study concludes that women investors who are active in the market differ from their male counterparts in only limited respects. Future research into women business angels, and the possible existence of gender differences, needs to be based on more fully elaborated standpoint epistemologies that focus on the experience of the woman angel investor per se, and center on the examination of the role of homophily, social capital, networking, and competition in investment behavior.",
Where do alliances come from? The effects of upper echelons on alliance formation,RESEARCH POLICY,May 2007,2007,"Alliances with established organizations provide young firms with resources necessary for survival. We build on recent organizational research examining the effect of upper echelons on attracting powerful intermediaries to understand how young biotechnology firms establish alliances with established organizations. Drawing upon the concept of homophily, we test hypotheses regarding the extent to which young firms and partners match along specific homophily dimensions. Our findings from an event-history analysis of 3,200 career histories of managers who took biotechnology firms public between 1979 and 1996 show that alliance formation is related to status homophily and role-based homophily between young and established organizations.

Nonverbal behavior of vendors in customer-vendor interaction,PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS,Apr 2007,2007,"Two research questions were posed on the homophily theory of customer-vendor interactions: (a) do vendors show any nonverbal preference for Euro-American or African-American customers?; (b) do vendors demonstrate any nonverbal preference for customers with which they share racial homophily? The results supported the homophily theory for Euro-American customers in that there were significant interaction effects by race in facial expression (F=5.33, p<.05), amount of speaking (F=6.76, p<.01), tone of voice (F=7.62, P<.01), and touching (F=4.57, p<.05). Vendor behavior varied when the customer was Euro-American, with Euro-American vendors smiling more frequently (M=4.05) than African-American vendors (M=3.69), speaking more frequently (M=3.57) than African-American vendors (M=3.09), using a more friendly tone of voice (M=3.59, and engaging in more touching behaviors (M = 1.81) than African-American vendors (M = 1.48). There was no significant difference in the behavior of Euro-American and African-American vendors when the customer was African-American.",
Tag-based indirect reciprocity by incomplete social information,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Mar 7 2007,2007,"Evolution of altruistic behaviour in interacting individuals is accounted for by, for example, kin selection, direct reciprocity, spatially limited interaction and indirect reciprocity. Real social agents, particularly humans, often take actions based on similarity between themselves and others. Although tag-based indirect reciprocity in which altruism occurs exclusively among similar flocks is a natural expectation, its mechanism has not really been established. We propose a model of tag-based indirect reciprocity by assuming that each player may note strategies of others. We show that tag-based altruism can evolve to eradicate other strategies, including unconditional defectors for various initial strategy configurations and parameter sets. A prerequisite for altruism is that the strategy is sometimes, but not always, visible to others. Without visibility of strategies, policing does not take place and defection is optimal. With perfect visibility, what a player does is always witnessed by others and cooperation is optimal. In the intermediate regime, discriminators based on tag proximity, rather than mixture of generous players and defectors, are most likely to evolve. In this situation, altruism is realized based on homophily in which players are exclusively good to similar others.",
A tale of two theories: Sympathy or competition?,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,Mar 2007,2007,"This research examines nontarget-market effects advertising targeted toward one ethnic minority group on consumers from other ethnic markets. The valence of these nontarget-market effects is a function of either homophily or group position theory. This study explores these two theories and examines which one better explains the phenomenon. According to homophily theory minorities should welcome ethnic advertising even if this is targeted towards another minority. On the other hand, group position theory predicts that minorities feel competitive towards each other and that competition triggers unfavorable attitudes toward advertisements featuring other minorities. Results show that nontarget-market effects are negative and are accentuated by individuals' feelings of ethnic identification, ethnic alienation and prejudice as implied by group position theory. The findings replicate across ethnic minority groups, and product categories. The article discusses managerial implications for marketers trying to attract several ethnic markets simultaneously.

Interpersonal similarity as a driver of knowledge sharing within multinational corporations,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW,Feb 2007,2007,"Knowledge sharing has attracted considerable interest in the context of the multinational corporation. However, although there is evidence to support the view that effective knowledge sharing is fundamental for competitive advantage, we still do not understand clearly enough the enablers and barriers to such knowledge sharing. In this paper, we argue that interpersonal similarity is one key driver behind knowledge sharing within the MNC context. We focus on the similarity of the national-cultural background, shared language, and similarity of organizational status as factors generating homophily. We suggest that such similarity leads to a higher tendency for interaction, increasing the sharing of business knowledge, and driving an aggregate effect of clustering. Based on a synthesis of the literature and a multiple case study of three multinationals, we argue that knowledge flows better within clusters driven by hornophily than between them, creating a paradox of homophily.

Model-based clustering for social networks,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY,2007,2007,"Network models are widely used to represent relations between interacting units or actors. Network data often exhibit transitivity, meaning that two actors that have ties to a third actor are more likely to be tied than actors that do not, homophily by attributes of the actors or dyads, and clustering. Interest often focuses on finding clusters of actors or ties, and the number of groups in the data is typically unknown. We propose a new model, the latent position cluster model, under which the probability of a tie between two actors depends on the distance between them in an unobserved Euclidean 'social space', and the actors' locations in the latent social space arise from a mixture of distributions, each corresponding to a cluster. We propose two estimation methods: a two-stage maximum likelihood method and a fully Bayesian method that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The former is quicker and simpler, but the latter performs better. We also propose a Bayesian way of determining the number of clusters that are present by using approximate conditional Bayes factors. Our model represents transitivity, homophily by attributes and clustering simultaneously and does not require the number of clusters to be known. The model makes it easy to simulate realistic networks with clustering, which are potentially useful as inputs to models of more complex systems of which the network is part, such as epidemic models of infectious disease. We apply the model to two networks of social relations. A free software package in the R statistical language, latentnet, is available to analyse data by using the model.",
Digital Green: Participatory Video for Agricultural Extension,2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVELOPMENT (ICTD),2007,2007,"Digital Green is a research project that seeks to disseminate targeted agricultural information to small and marginal farmers in India using digital video. The unique components of Digital Green are (1) a participatory process for content production, (2) a locally generated digital video database, (3) human-mediated instruction for dissemination and training, and (4) regimented sequencing to initiate a new community.Unlike some systems that expect information or communication technology alone to deliver useful knowledge to marginal farmers, Digital Green works with existing, people-based extension systems and aims to amplify their effectiveness. While video provides a point of focus, it is people and social dynamics that ultimately make Digital Green work. Local social networks are tapped to connect farmers with experts; the thrill of appearing ""on TV"" motivates farmers; and homophily is exploited to minimize the distance between teacher and learner.In a four-month trial involving 16 villages (1070 households), Digital Green was seen to increase adoption of certain agriculture practices by a factor of six to seven times over classical person-only agriculture extension. The hardware investment was a TV and a DVD-player per village, and one digital camera and PC shared among all 16 villages. These results are very preliminary, but promising.",
Friendship homophily among diaspora migrant adolescents in Germany and Israel,EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST,2007,2007,"Immigrant adolescents have been found to prefer intraethnic over interethnic friendships, a phenomenon called friendship homophily (FH). This study investigates whether Russian Jewish immigrants in Israel and ethnic German immigrants in Germany differ in their FH rates, which variables predict friendship homophily in each sample, and whether relative strength of association between predictors and FH differs between both samples. FH is measured using reports on best friends, cliques, and distant friendships. Results found FH, in general, to be more pronounced in the Russian Jewish sample, and acculturation orientation and language use predicted interindividual differences in FH in both samples. Perceived discrimination predicted higher levels of FH in cliques and distant friendships only in Israel. Findings suggest the importance of acculturation in selecting intra- or interethnic friends.",
Birds of moderately different feathers: Bandwagon dynamics and the threshold heterogeneity of network neighbors,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY,JAN-MAR 2007,2007,"This paper investigates bandwagon dynamics in social networks, using an extension of Granovetter's (1978) threshold model. The focus is on the pattern of social ties connecting actors with different participation thresholds. A benchmark model, in which actors' thresholds are similar to their neighbors' thresholds, is built from the principle of homophily. Computational experiments show that participation levels increase when network structure departs from pure homophily, such that actors have new neighbors with discrepant thresholds. Further increasing the heterogeneity of network neighbors causes the bandwagon effects to wane, however, suggesting that bandwagon dynamics are maximized when there is a balance of heterogeneity and homogeneity in social networks. This principle is consistent with insights from several empirical studies and consistent with the conclusions of other formal models.",
Shared targets for aggression by early adolescent friends,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 2006,2006,"Similarity in early adolescent friends' general aggressiveness is well known, but questions remain regarding the degree to which friends aggress against the same victims. The authors examined this by administering the newly created Dyadic Aggression and Victimization Inventory to 417 sixth- through eighth-grade boys and girls (53%). Friends were found to share more targets for aggression than nonfriends, even after general levels of aggression were controlled (all ps < .05). Moreover, greater sharing of targets with friends relative to nonfriends was more pronounced among aggressive youths than nonaggressive youths, especially among aggressive youths' best friends relative to their other friends. Generally, these findings were similar across boys and girls as well as among older and younger youths. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.",
"Similarities in children's and early adolescents' perceptions of friendship qualities across development, gender, and friendship qualities",JOURNAL OF EARLY ADOLESCENCE,Nov 2006,2006,"Similarities between adolescents are often the cornerstone of a friendship; yet researchers know little about the similarities in friends' perceptions of the relationship. In the current study, the authors examine similarities in friends' perceived friendship qualities during the transition into early adolescence (n = 77 third graders, 110 fourth graders, 86 fifth graders, 81 sixth graders). The same study participants were assessed every year, but different self-selected friends of the study participants were assessed each year. Youth's perceptions of conflict, help, disclosure, companionship, conflict resolution, and validation were measured with the Friendship Quality Questionnaire. Findings suggest that the study participants' and their friends' perceptions of firiendship qualities were moderately similar These similarities did not typically differ across development, gender, or the type of friendship quality. The importance of firiendships for development during the transition into early adolescence is emphasized.",
"Arcadia: meaning and issues regarding ""homophily"" in France, 1954-1982",REVUE D HISTOIRE MODERNE ET CONTEMPORAINE,OCT-DEC 2006,2006,"This proposes a new approach to the history of the French ""homophile"" movement Arcadie (1954-1982). After an analysis of the reasons for the historiographical neglect of Arcadie, the article presents a brief history of the movement, based on archives which have not been used before and interviews with leader of the organisation. Then the article outlines the moral vision and political strategy of Arcadie whose objective was to integrate homosexuality into society by demonstrating its normality - the key words were ""prudence"" and ""dignity"" - and it analyses how this discourse was received by the rank and file members. If it was true that the prudent policy of Arcadie was sometimes contested from below, the article, rejecting an anachronistic approach to the period, argues the necessity to reject the demonisation of Arcadie which was carried out in the 1970s by a new generation of gay activists who accused the movement of having interiorised the oppression and guilt imposed by heterosexual society. On the contrary, quite apart from the moral and practical support which Arcadie offered to thousands of male homosexuals (and some lesbians) Arcadie had its own vision of homosexual authenticity, although different from that of post 68 radicals: one must avoid an anachronistic approach to the period. Finally the article show that there were unresolved tensions between Arcadie's desire to create a homosexual community and its objective of integrating homosexuals into society at large - between the idea that homosexuals were individuals no different from any others and the idea that there was a specifically homosexual identity.",
VIP-club phenomenon: Emergence of elites and masterminds in social networks,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2006,2006,"Hubs, or vertices with large degrees, play massive roles in, for example, epidemic dynamics, innovation diffusion, and synchronization on networks. However, costs of owning edges can motivate agents to decrease their degrees and avoid becoming hubs, whereas they would somehow like to keep access to a major part of the network. By analyzing a model and tennis players' partnership networks, we show that combination of vertex fitness and homophily yields a VIP-club made of elite vertices that are influential but not easily accessed from the majority. Intentionally formed VIP members can even serve as masterminds, which manipulate hubs to control the entire network without exposing themselves to a large mass. If based on network topology only, elites are not distinguished from many other vertices. Understanding network data is far from sufficient; individualistic factors greatly affect network structure and functions per se. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
What makes a girl (or a boy) popular (or unpopular)? African American children's perceptions and developmental differences,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Jul 2006,2006,"Open-ended questions were used to obtain narrative accounts of what makes a girl (or a boy) popular (or unpopular) at school. The participants were 489 African American students in Grades 1, 4, and 7 recruited from high-risk inner-city neighborhoods. Appearance and self-presentation were mentioned the most in Grades 4 and 7. Prosocial characteristics were especially relevant for popularity in Grade 1, as were studentship in Grade 4 and peer affiliations in Grade 7. Deviant behaviors were nominated for popularity more frequently in Grade 7 than in the younger grades and more for boys' popularity than for girls'. The mean deviance scores were negative in all grade levels, suggesting a normative peer culture. Male groups in Grade 7 showed significant homophily in reports of deviant behaviors.",
Homophily of network ties and bonding and bridging social capital in computer-mediated distributed teams,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Jul 2006,2006,"This research studied homophily of network ties in distributed teams in both task-related instrumental networks and non-task related expressive networks. Homophily of network ties was examined in terms of demographic and social characteristics, including gender, race, geographic location, and group assignment. Social network data were collected from 32 Students enrolled in a distance learning class from two universities. MQAP regression analysis showed that homophily in gender and in race had no significant impact on the development of either instrumental or expressive ties. In instrumental networks, both homophily in group assignment and in location had significant impact oil the development of network ties. In expressive networks, homophily in location had significant impact on the development of network ties, but the impact of homophily in group membership was only marginally significant. Further analysis of bonding ties with people of the same group and bridging ties with people from different groups showed that bonding social capital can exert significant influence on performance.",
Enabling agile adoption practices through network organizations,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS,Apr 2006,2006,"As distributed organizations increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance organizational efficiency and competitiveness, interest in agile practices that enable adoption of information technology (IT) based innovations has grown. This study examines the influence of a network organization environment on the ability to develop agile adoption practices. An exploratory case study design was used to investigate the interactions between network structure, social information processing, organizational similarity (homophily), and absorptive capacity during the adoption of a large-scale IT system in two network organization environments within New York State. The data suggest that network organization characteristics and communication processes that reinforced social influence and supported knowledge transfer positively influenced adoption agility. We propose a model of agile adoption practices and discuss implications for the development of theory about network organization characteristics and capabilities to adopt IT-based innovations.",
Network of social groups or let's have a party,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C,Apr 2006,2006,"We present a simple model for growing up and depletion of parties due to the permanent communication between the participants of the events. Because of the rapid exchange of information, everybody is able to evaluate its own and all other parties by means of the list of its friends. Therefore, the number of participants at different parties can be changed incessantly. Depending on the depth of the social contacts, which will be characterized by a parameter alpha, a stable distribution of party members emerges. At a critical alpha(c) an abrupt depletion of almost all parties is observed and as the consequence all the people are assembled at a single party. The model is based on a hierarchical social network. The probability that a certain person is contacted by another one depends on the social distance introduced within the network and homophily parameter alpha.",

Estimating the causal effect of social capital: A review of recent research,ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY,2006,2006,"Although there is a large literature on social capital, empirical estimates of the effect of social capital may be biased because of social homophily, the tendency of similar people to become friends with each other. Despite the methodological difficulties, a recent literature has emerged across several different disciplines that tries to estimate the causal effect of social capital. This paper reviews this recent empirical literature on social capital, paying close attention to the statistical and theoretical assumptions involved. Overall, there is evidence that genuine progress has been made in estimating the effect of social capital. The reviewed articles should provide useful examples for future research.",
Factors influencing progress in establishing community-based marine protected areas in Indonesia,COASTAL MANAGEMENT,JAN-MAR 2006,2006,"Concerns are being raised about high failure rates of community-based small-scale no-take marine reserves that are proliferating in the Southeast Asian region. Factors hypothesized to influence success include intrinsic community characteristics, project input levels, and change agent characteristics. An empirical analysis of these hypotheses was conducted using a sample of 24 villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, where marine reserves were in early phases of establishment. Factors found to influence the rate of progress were village complexity, level of development, project input levels, characteristics of community organizers, and degree of community organizer homophily relative to the community. These findings are important for community-based marine conservation initiatives conducting simultaneous interventions in multiple communities. It provides insights in how project strategies can be adjusted to increase the probability of success, obtain economies of scale, target communities more amenable to community-based interventions and result in a better return on project investments.",
Structural Analysis of an Online Social Network: A Case Study of the Friendship Network in 'Cyworld',Informatization Policy,2006,2006,"The aim of this study is twofold. First, we use a “network sampling method”to estimate the characteristic path length of one of Korea’s most popular and largest online social networks, the Cyworld “ilchon"", network, or friendship network. Second, we measure homophily tendencies exhibited by Cyworld users in terms of gender, age, and region, using log-linear models. Results show that the Cyworld friendship network is a small world where most of the users are connected to one another by an average of 4.3 degrees and where homophilious tendencies are strongest for region and weakest for gender. The inferred characteristic path length of the Cyworld friendship network approximates that of the offline letter experiment conducted in Korea, a replication of the well-known small world experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960’s. The results are in line with prior research and suggest that online social relations reflect offline social relations and support the view that online and offline social spaces interpenetrate.",
The Role of Interpersonal Communication Networkin Modeling Planned Behavior of the Public Issue: Understanding Drinking Behavior of Tap Water,Korean Journal of Journalism & Communication Studies,2006,2006,"It is important in planning communication campaign strategies to understand and explain human behavior. In an attempt to understand and explain the public’s attitudes to and behavior of a public issue (i. e., tap water quality and safety), the current study examined the role of interpersonal communication network in predicting drinking behavior of tap water by conducting a survey among 300 residents in Seoul, South Korea. The survey results suggested that drinking behavior of tap water could well be explained by integrating the theory of planned behavior (TPB), interpersonal communication, and social network analysis (SNA). Drinking behavior of non-filtered tap water was predicted not by behavioral intentions to drink tap water, but by perceived behavioral control of and attitudes to drinking tap water. Intentions to drink tap water were influenced by evaluative beliefs, such as perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norms. Theses evaluative beliefs were associated with attributes of interpersonal communication network (e. g., density, size, and heterogeneity) as well as mass media use. In addition, homophily was observed in interpersonal communication network―that is, people were more likely to talk about tap water quality with others who were similar to themselves. Discussed were theoretical and practical implications.",
Career mobility and job flocking,SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH,Dec 2005,2005,"Flocking is oftentimes used to metaphorically describe social behavior. Do people actually flock in a way that avian species do? This paper develops a purely ecological mechanism for explaining similarity in human behavior by distinguishing between social networks of person-to-person ties and ecological networks of ties of observability. I test the ""information center hypothesis"" [Ibis 115 (1973) 517] from bioecology on the career mobility of professional managers who all graduated from the same university. In this case, spatial proximity in birds is replaced with sociodemographic homophily on an acquired status characteristic among persons. The results indicate that homophilous individuals exchange information about a favorable destination state by ecological ties of observability, that is, they follow the career mobility of fellow alumni and ""flock"" along with them.

"The influence of the avatar on Online perceptions of anthropomorphism, androgyny, credibility, homophily, and attraction",JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,Oct 2005,2005,"It has become increasingly common for websites and computer media to provide computer generated visual images, called avatars, to represent users and bots during online interactions, In this study, participants (N=255) evaluated a series of avatars in a static context in terms of their androgyny, anthropomorphism, credibility, homophily, attraction, and the likelihood they would choose them during an interaction, The responses to the images were consistent with what would be predicted by uncertainty reduction theory. The results show that the masculinity or femininity (lack of androgyny) of an avatar, as well as anthropomorphism, significantly influence perceptions of avatars. Further, more anthropomorphic avatars were perceived to be more attractive and credible, and people were more likely to choose to be represented by them. Participants reported masculine avatars as less attractive than feminine avatars, and most people reported a preference for human avatars that matched their gender. Practical and theoretical implications of these results for users, designers, and researchers of avatars are discussed.",
Social dynamics in the preschool,DEVELOPMENTAL REVIEW,SEP-DEC 2005,2005,"In this paper, we consider how concepts from dynamic systems (such as attractors, repellors, and self-organization) can be applied to the study of young children's peer relationships. We also consider how these concepts can be Used to explore basic issues involving early peer processes. We use the dynamical systems approach called state space grid (SSG) analysis and consider how it can be expanded beyond the study of dyads to the study of larger social groups and networks. In particular, we explore the role of homophily-that is, behavioral and sex similarity-as factors in the self-organization of young children's social groups. A dynamic systems approach allows for consideration of peer processes difficult to assess Using more traditional approaches. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
The evolution of intra-organizational trust networks - The case of a German paper factory: An empirical test of six trust mechanisms,INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY,Sep 2005,2005,"Based on the distinction between expressive and instrumental motives, six theoretical mechanisms for the formation of trust relationships are elaborated and empirically tested. When expressive motives drive tie formation, individuals primarily attach emotional value to social relationships. Three mechanisms have been tested: the homophily, the balancing, and the gossiping effect. When instrumental, control-related, motives drive tie formation, actors strategically establish relationships because of their potential use for the realization of material benefits or the avoidance of material losses. Again, three mechanisms have been tested: the signalling, the sharing group and the structural hole effect. Longitudinal data come from a sociometric panel study of 17 members of the management team of a German paper factory. Actor-oriented statistical modelling shows that all effects significantly affect trust formation separately In a simultaneous test incorporating all six mechanisms, the pattern of structural holes turns out to be the major predictor of network evolution. The implications of structural hole theory for modelling the evolution of intraorganizational networks are discussed.",
"Preferences, identity, and competition: Predicting tie strength from demographic data",MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Sep 2005,2005,"This research examines the combined influence of three causal mechanisms shaping interpersonal dynamics. Sharing a demographic characteristic has been shown to strengthen a relationship between people. The initial explanation for this positive effect emphasized the importance of individual preferences for social contact. Similar people share common interests, which makes them more attractive as exchange partners. More recent explanations have highlighted the important role of identification and competition. Identification increases the tendency for strong ties to develop among similar people, while competition reduces that tendency I argue that tie strength is a function of all three mechanisms: a baseline level of interpersonal attraction, a positive identification effect, and a negative competition adjustment. Identification and competition vary with the number of people sharing the focal attribute to define a predictable association between sharing the focal attribute and the strength of a network connection. Predictions are tested with tenure and tie-strength data from a small research and development firm. Analysis indicates that having the same tenure has the predicted effect on communication frequency. The implications of the findings are discussed for homophily research in particular and demography research in general.",
Diversity and homophily at work: Supportive relations among white and African-American peers,ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Aug 2005,2005,"Dividends from employee diversity may require intergroup knowledge and information sharing, which in turn may depend on supportive peer relations. Yet little is known about the antecedents of such supportive relations among the racially dissimilar. We posited that the relative prevalence of supportive relations among dissimilar peers will be higher in work units with high task interdependence and a strong peer support climate but will decline as the proportion of racially different others increases (a ""homophily"" effect). An inverse relationship between the! proportion of racially different others and supportive relations among whites and blacks was found; it was curvilinear and moderated by support climate.",
Interorganizational determinants of promotion: Client leadership and the attainment of women attorneys,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Aug 2005,2005,"Explanations of gender inequality typically emphasize individual characteristics, the structure of internal labor markets, or pressures from the institutional environment. Extending the structuralist and institutional perspectives, this article argues that the demographic composition of an organization exchange partners can influence the demographic composition of the focal organization when the focal organization is dependent upon its partners. Specifically, law firms with women-led corporate clients increase the number of partners who are women attorneys. Data on elite law firms and their publicly traded clients support a bargaining power hypothesis whereby law firms promote women attorneys when their corporate clients have women in three key leadership positions: general (legal) counsel, chief executive officer and board director These effects are stronger when the law firm has few clients, reinforcing the hypothesis that interorganizational influence is more vital when a focal organization is dependent on its exchange partner. The results also support a related explanation based on homophily theory. The analysis rules out several alternative explanations and establishes a relationship between the presence of women-led clients and the promotion of women attorneys in law firms.",
Epidemics and dimensionality in hierarchical networks,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Jul 15 2005,2005,"Epidemiological processes are studied within a recently proposed hierarchical network model using the susceptible infected-refractory dynamics of an epidemic. Within the network model, a population may be characterized by H independent hierarchies or dimensions, each of which consists of groupings of individuals into layers of subgroups. Detailed numerical simulations reveal that for H > 1, global spreading results regardless of the degree of homophily of the individuals forming a social circle. For H = 1, a transition from global to local spread occurs as the population becomes decomposed into increasingly homophilous groups. Multiple dimensions in classifying individuals (nodes) thus make a society (computer network) highly susceptible to large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases (viruses).

Can stable social groups be maintained by homophilous imitation alone?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,Jul 2005,2005,"A central problem in the biological and social sciences concerns the conditions required for emergence and maintenance of cooperation among unrelated individuals. Most models and experiments have been pursued in a game-theoretic context and involve reward or punishment. Here, we show that such payoffs are unnecessary, and that stable social groups can sometimes be maintained provided simply that agents are more likely to imitate others who are like them (homophily). In contrast to other studies, to sustain multiple types we need not impose the restriction that agents also choose to make their opinions different from those in other groups. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These attributes are derived from different theoretical perspectives which have led to clinical trials and other empirical studies demonstrating effectiveness or attraction to end users. The effects of a subset of these attributes are connected to learning, social influence, and coping, as illustrated in evaluations of an interactive smoking prevention site and a cancer advice/support discussion system.",
"Network structure, diversity, and proactive resilience building: a response to Tompkins and Adger",ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,Jun 2005,2005,"Although community social networks can build resilience, and thus, aid adaptation to unexpected environmental change (Tomkins and Adger 2004), not all social networks are created equal. Networks composed of a diversity of ""bridging"" links to a diverse web of resources and ""bonding"" links that build trust strengthen a community's ability to adapt to change, but networks composed only of ""bonding"" links can impose constraining social norms and foster group homophily, reducing resilience. Diversity fosters the resilience needed to adapt to unexpected change, and can also enlarge the ability to proactively make collective decisions that optimize future options.",
Exposure to externalizing peers in early childhood: Homophily and peer contagion processes,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,Jun 2005,2005,"Guided by a transactional model, we examined the predictors and effects of exposure to externalizing peers in a low-risk sample of preschoolers and kindergarteners. On the basis of daily observations of peer interactions, we calculated measures of total exposure to externalizing peers and measures of exposure to same- and other-sex externalizing peers. Analyses of predictors of externalizing peer exposure supported a homophily hypothesis for girls. Tests of peer contagion effects varied by sex, and exposure to externalizing peers predicted multiple problem behaviors for girls but not for boys. Sex differences were a function of children's own sex, but not of peers sex. The study provides evidence of externalizing peer exposure effects in a low-risk sample of young children, notably for girls.",
Decentralized Search in Networks Using Homophily and Degree Disparity,19TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI-05),2005,2005,"We propose a new algorithm for finding a target node in a network whose topology is known only locally. We formulate this task as a problem of decision making under uncertainty and use the statistical properties of the graph to guide this decision. This formulation uses the homophily and degree structure of the network simultaneously, differentiating our algorithm from those previously proposed in the literature. Because homophily and degree disparity are characteristics frequently observed in real-world networks, the algorithm we propose is applicable to a wide variety of networks, including two families that have received much recent attention: small-world and scale-free networks.",
Network dynamics and field evolution: The growth of interorganizational collaboration in the life sciences,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY,Jan 2005,2005,"A recursive analysis of network and institutional evolution is offered to account for the decentralized structure of the commercial field of the life sciences. Four alternative logics of attachment - accumulative advantage, homophily, follow-the-trend, and multiconnectivity - are tested to explain the structure and dynamics of interorganizational collaboration in biotechnology. Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners.",
DO BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER AND PERFORM ECONOMICALLY BETTER? A STUDY OF THE HOMOPHILY PARADOX AMONG IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS IN GERMANY,"ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, VOLS 1 AND 2",2005,2005,"In the current research we explore whether the homophily as an organising principle impacts the performance of immigrant entrepreneurs in Germany. The empirical analysis is based on a detailed survey of 500 immigrant entrepreneurs from six different countries. The survey was conducted during the period September-October 2002 in Hamburg city by means of face-to-face interviews.The main finding suggests that the process of composing a working team within a venture is likely to follow the principle of homophily. The gender-based honophily raises significantly the volume of sales by 8.31 while increasing the male dominance by 10 per cent. The nationally homogenous working teams are the regular case in our study. In 72.3 per cent of the companies, the working team is composed of mainly employees from the same country of origin as the entrepreneur. Surprisingly, the so formed team structure causes decline in the sales per employee by 5.14 per cent while increasing the dominance of co-nationals by 10 per cent. Additionally, cooperating mostly with co-nationals as suppliers improves the economic performance of immigrant entrepreneurs by 4.78 per cent. As apposed to, serving mainly German customers increases significantly the volume of sales per employee.",
A Research on the Interrelationship between Organisational Culture and Women's Social Network in Korea,Journal of Korean Women＇s Studies,2005,2005,"This research intends to examine the interrelationship between the gendered Organisational culture between the construction of women's social network from a feminist perspective. In doing so, I interviewed fifteen female workers working for various organisations(Conglomerates, an organ of expression)during over five years based upon the feminist methodology. This research suggests that firstly, how female workers consist of social network based upon the homophily such as same gender, school and region. Secondly, this research is subject to examine the relationship between the various aspects(cultural features of each company, varieties in a category of business and status, the entertainment culture based upon drinking alcohol etc.) of organisational culture and construction of women's social network. As a result, this research suggests the social network of female workers as a social capital is socially constructed while female workers assume or resist the specificities of organisational culture. In this context, this research discusses how to change from the gendered organisation to equalised and impartial organisation.",
"Recreation, informal social networks and social capital",JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH,2005,2005,"This paper examines the determinants of recreational practices amongst members of three diverse voluntary associations in the North West of England, focusing on being hosts and guests in private homes and eating and drinking outside the home. Using multi-level models analysing a rich data source on the social networks of members, we show how respondents' sociability is affected less by their socio-demographic characteristics than by the nature of their social networks. We show, against expectations, that there is little evidence of homophily in these recreational practices, which indicates that informal social contacts may be especially important in generating ""bridging"" and ""boundary-spanning"" types of social capital. We use the evidence to argue the need for a ""sociology of companionship"" which highlights routine sociability around recreational practices.",

Identifying the role that animals play in their social networks,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Dec 7 2004,2004,"Techniques recently developed for the analysis of human social networks are applied to the social network of bottlenose dolphins living in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. We identify communities and sub-communities within the dolphin population and present evidence that sex- and age-related homophily play a role in the formation of clusters of preferred companionship. We also identify brokers who act as links between sub-communities and who appear to be crucial to the social cohesion of the population as a whole. The network is found to be similar to human social networks in some respects but different in some others, such as the level of assortative mixing by degree within the population. This difference elucidates some of the means by which the network forms and evolves.",
A decade of system justification theory: Accumulated evidence of conscious and unconscious bolstering of the status quo,POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,Dec 2004,2004,"Most theories in social and political psychology stress self-interest, intergroup conflict, ethnocentrism, homophily, ingroup bias, outgroup antipathy, dominance, and resistance. System justification theory is influenced by these perspectives-including social identity and social dominance theories-but it departs from them in several respects. Advocates of system justification theory argue that (a) there is a general ideological motive to justify the existing social order, (b) this motive is at least partially responsible for the internalization of inferiority among members of disadvantaged groups, (c) it is observed most readily at an implicit, nonconscious level of awareness and (d) paradoxically, it is sometimes strongest among those who are most harmed by the status quo. This article reviews and integrates 10 years of research on 20 hypotheses derived from a system justification perspective, focusing on the phenomenon of implicit outgroup favoritism among members of disadvantaged groups (including African Americans, the elderly, and gays/lesbians) and its relation to political ideology (especially liberalism-conservatism).",
"Very Important Persons in adolescence: going beyond in-school, single friendships in the study of peer homophily",JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE,Oct 2004,2004,"Using a sample of 1227 Swedish adolescents we examined peer relations across contexts and for multiple peer targets (three ""Very Important Persons"", VIPs). Specifically, we examined the relations between antisocial behaviour and the types of relationships individuals had with their VIPs (e.g. friend, romantic partner), the contexts in which they had met, and where they spent time (e.g. school, neighbourhood, club). Additionally, we tested an ""additive homophily"" hypothesis, or the idea that youths would show unique similarities to multiple peers. Results showed that individuals who nominated romantic partners as their first VIPs were the most antisocial (both boys and girls), and individuals who had met and spent time with their first VIPs in the neighbourhood were also the most antisocial. Similar results were found for the antisocial behaviour of the first VIP. Finally, results supported the additive homophily hypothesis, showing that significantly more variance in individual behaviour is explained when including second and third VIPs.

The social networks of women experiencing domestic violence,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY,Sep 2004,2004,"The research literature has demonstrated that battered women living in shelters experience impaired social support. This study examines this phenomenon among battered women living in the community. This study compared a group of pregnant battered women (n=145) and a group of pregnant nonbattered women (n=58) in terms of their structural [e.g., total number of supporters, network members in violent relationships with their partners (an index of homophily or nonhomophily) and functional (e.g., emotional)] social support. Four reasons for impaired support in battered women were proposed and examined, including social isolation, failure to disclose abuse, homophily, and low SES. Only homophily was related to impaired support among battered women. In addition, the relationship between structural and functional support and mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, self-esteem) was examined. Criticism, practical support, homophily, and disclosure were all significant predictors of mental health for battered women. Implications for community-based interventions are discussed in the context of current intervention strategies with battered women.",
Social networks and aggressive behaviour in Chinese children,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT,Sep 2004,2004,"This exploratory study investigated Mainland Chinese children's social networks and peer group affiliations with a particular emphasis on their aggressive behaviour. The participants were 294 elementary school students in Tianjin, P. R. China (mean age 11.5 years; 161 boys). Social network analysis identified relatively large and gender-specific peer groups. Although different measures were used, the pattern of homophily characteristic of Western aggressive children was partially supported. This finding may be due to the large size of the peer groups. The results showed that some aggressive children formed friendships with nonaggressive children. Moreover, for the aggressive children who were group members, the number of within-group friendships moderated the relation between aggression and overall peer preference. In addition, despite the moderating effect of within-group friendship, the relation between aggression and peer preference remained significantly negative even at the highest levels of friendship. Aggressive children who were isolated from all peer groups had higher hyperactivity ratings and were less liked by peers than were aggressive children who were group members. These findings illustrate how culture may be an influence on patterns of peer group affiliation.",
Bringing clients back in: Homophily preferences and inequality on Wall Street,SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY,FAL 2004,2004,"Using qualitative data from a cohort sample of 76 current or former Wall Street professionals, I argue that the perception that clients prefer homophily with their service providers shapes Wall Street careers and contributes to gender inequality. I also reveal how some women on Wall Street partially insulate themselves from biases against them by deliberately avoiding positions that are most dependent on client relationships. I hypothesize that the strength of client preferences for homophily in service providers in the Wall Street context is related to the high status of this service profession and its clients.",
"The emergence, maintenance, and dissolution of structural hole brokerage within consortia",COMMUNICATION THEORY,Aug 2004,2004,"This essay focuses on the emergence, maintenance, and dissolution of structural bole brokerage within consortia. The difficulties in forming consortia are well known. Many are associated with the natural structural bole that exists between the parties. Approaches to this problem have been hampered historically by theoretic traditions that have focused on either classic system benefits or more contemporary market consideration of individual interests. Here the author develops propositions concerning the emergence, maintenance, and dissolution of these relationships, focusing on four central factors drawn from different theoretic traditions: homophily, trust, the balance between threats and shared interests, and the balance between differentiation and integration. The author then discusses the implications of this integrated theoretical framework for researcher-practitioner relationships as an exemplar and for trends in network analysis research.",
Opposites do not attract: Social status and behavioral-style concordances and discordances among children and the peers who like or dislike them,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,Aug 2004,2004,"Homophily, a term used to describe the tendency to associate with similar others, serves as a basis for attraction among children. The converse may also be true. Dissimilarity appears to contribute to dislike. In one of the only published studies to examine homophily and its converse, D. W. Nangle, C. A. Erdley, and J. A. Gold ( 1996) found that children were liked by peers who were similar to them in social status and behavioral style and disliked by peers who were dissimilar to them in social status and behavioral style. Examining gender influences, we were only able to partially replicate their findings in the present study. That is, evidence of homophily was found only for girls. In contrast, dissimilarity contributed to dislike for both genders, but was especially evident for boys. With respect to age, prosocial behavior appeared to have a more positive valence among younger girls, whereas aggressive behavior appeared to have a more negative valence among older boys. Attempts to reconcile these findings with those of the Nangle et al. ( 1996) investigation and the implications for understanding peer processes, gender influences, and behavior problems are discussed.",
Gaining compliance and losing weight: The role of the service provider in health care services,JOURNAL OF MARKETING,Jul 2004,2004,"This research provides and empirically tests a conceptualization of health care services in which customer compliance outside of the service organization is necessary for successful health outcomes. Using data from service providers and customers in a weight-loss clinic, the authors examine the provider's role in gaining customer compliance. They find that provider expertise and attitudinal homophily play a role in bringing about customer role clarity, ability, and motivation. This study demonstrates that compliance leads to goal attainment, which results in satisfaction. More important, compliance also leads to satisfaction directly; consumers who comply with program requirements have greater satisfaction with the program.",

Finally, the primary, challenges researchers face when applying the networkperspective to small groups, and the primary benefits that can accrue to researchers who adopt that perspective, are enumerated.",
The social psychology of tokenism: Status and homophily processes on Wall Street,SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,SUM 2004,2004,"Mile conscious action may produce some inequality, most discrimination occurs through cognitive processes that are automatic and unconscious. I examine the role of two cognitive mechanisms that affect gender inequality in the securities industry: homophily preferences and status expectations. I argue that homophily preferences and status expectations are the general cognitive processes that produce the effects of ""tokenism,"" which were originally identified by Kanter for female tokens. These processes also lead to differences in the experiences of male and female tokens. I use qualitative data on 76 Wall Street professionals to illustrate how homophily and status processes maintain and reproduce stratification in securities firms. Moreover, the compensation system in this industry, which rewards employees based on performance evaluations, aggravates the effects of these cognitive processes. Strong mentors, the possession of specialized skills, and objective performance indicators seem to mitigate these effects for a minority of women.",
"Advances in biased net theory: definitions, derivations, and estimations",SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2004,2004,"Random and biased net theory, introduced by Rapoport and others in the 1950s, is one of the earliest approaches to the formal modeling of social networks. In this theory, intended as a theory of large-scale networks, ties between nodes derive both from random and non-random events of connection. The non-random connections are postulated to arise through ""bias"" events that incorporate known or suspected systematic tendencies in tie formation, such as, mutuality or reciprocity, transitivity or closure in triads, and homophily-the overrepresentation of ties between persons who share important socio-demographic attributes like race/ethnicity or level of educational attainment. A key problem for biased net theory has been analytical intractability of the models. Formal derivations require approximation assumptions and model parameters have been difficult to estimate. The accuracy of the derived formulas and the estimated parameters has been difficult to assess. In this paper, we attempt to address long-standing issues in biased net models stemming from their analytical intractability. We first reformulate and clarify the definitions of basic biases. Second, we derive from first principles the triad distribution in a biased net, using two different analytical strategies to check our derivations. Third, we set out a pseudo-likelihood method for parameter estimation of key bias parameters and then check the accuracy of this relatively simple but approximate scheme against the results obtained from the triad distribution derivation.

Knowledge sharing through social networks in project-based organizations,"PEOPLE, KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY: WHAT HAVE WE LEARNT SO FAR?",2004,2004,"Based on literature on knowledge management and social networks, this paper investigates the effects of four aspects, namely perceived task interdependency, hierarchical distance, historical experiences and background homophily, on the formation of mutual-choice relations for knowledge benefit in project-based organizations. In addition, this paper also finds that the strength of relations for knowledge sharing affects project members' preference of knowledge management approaches. Strong ties support the choice of Human-Centric (HC) Knowledge Management approaches, when people obtain double-loop knowledge benefits; while weak ties support a beneficial effect on the use of Technology-Centric (TC) Knowledge Management approaches, when dyads share single-loop knowledge benefits.",
Group composition and network structure in school classes: a multilevel application of the p* model,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Oct 2003,2003,"This paper describes the structure of social networks of students within school classes and examines differences in network structure between classes. In order to examine the network structure within school classes, we focused in particular on the principle of homophily, i.e. the tendency that people associate with similar others. When differences between classes were observed, it was investigated whether these were related to group compositional characteristics. A two-stage regression procedure is proposed to analyze social networks of multiple groups. The random coefficient model is discussed briefly as an alternative to the two-stage method.

Peer relations across contexts: Individual-network homophily and network inclusion in and after school,CHILD DEVELOPMENT,SEP-OCT 2003,2003,"Peer relations across 2 contexts (in school and after school) were examined for 577 participants, approximately 12 years old, from 3 middle schools in Milan, Italy. The primary. research questions were: Do peer networks from different contexts uniquely contribute to explaining variance in individual behavior? Do measures of peer preference and peer network inclusion across contexts uniquely contribute to explaining individual depressive symptoms? Structural equation models showed that both the in-school and the after-school peer networks uniquely contributed to explaining variance in 2 types of individual problem behavior (in-school problem behavior, after-school delinquency), and that similarity with the 2 peer networks varied according to behaviors specific to each context and across gender. Finally, both in-school and after-school peer network inclusion contributed to explaining variance in depressive symptoms, after controlling for classroom peer preference.",

Computer simulation demonstrates that these models are alternative explanations for the finding that different cultural tastes and practices are concentrated within different sociodemographic segments of society. Conflicting implications of the two models are identified. Although both models predict that cultural forms compete for people (i.e., people are a scarce resource on which cultural forms depend), the distancing model differs from the homophily model in that the distancing model predicts a dual ecology: Not only do cultural forms compete for people, but people compete for cultural forms. According to the distancing model, the larger the segment of society in which a cultural form is liked, the smaller is the proportion of people in that segment of society who like that cultural form. The homophily model predicts that people do not compete for cultural forms. Instead, it predicts a local bandwagon effect: The larger the segment of society in which a cultural form is liked, the larger is the proportion of people in that segment of society who like that cultural form. An empirical test using 1993 General Social Survey data supports the prediction of both models that cultural forms compete for people. The analysis also reveals a local bandwagon effect, yielding further empirical support for the homophily model and disconfirming the distancing model's prediction of a dual ecology.",

"The structure of founding teams: Homophily, strong ties, and isolation among US entrepreneur",AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Apr 2003,2003,"The mechanisms governing the composition of formal social groups (e.g., task groups, organizational founding teams) remain poorly understood, owing to (1) a lack of representative sampling from groups found in the general population, (2) a ""success"" bias among researchers that leads them to consider only those groups that actually emerge and survive, and (3) a restrictive focus on some theorized mechanisms of group composition (e.g., homophily) to the exclusion of others. These shortcomings are addressed by analyzing a unique, representative data set of organizational founding teams sampled from the U.S. population. Rather than simply considering the properties of those founding teams that are empirically observed, a novel quantitative methodology generates the distribution of all possible teams, based on combinations of individual and relational characteristics. This methodology permits the exploration of five mechanisms of group composition-those based on homophily. functionality, status expectations, network constraint, and ecological constraint. Findings suggest that homophily and network constraints based on strong ties have the most pronounced effect on group composition. Social isolation (i.e., exclusion from a group) is more likely to occur as a result of ecological constraints on the availability of similar alters in a locality than as a result of status-varying membership choices.",
"Viewer aggression and homophily, identification, and parasocial relationships with television characters",JOURNAL OF BROADCASTING & ELECTRONIC MEDIA,Mar 2003,2003,"This study examined the antecedents of viewer relationships experienced with television characters. Based on social cognitive theory, we considered how trait aggression helped explain identification, homophily, and parasocial interaction with aggressive characters. Two hundred nineteen participants completed questionnaires measuring trait aggression and relationships with one of eight characters. We content analyzed portrayals of these characters to determine their levels of aggression. Results suggested viewer aggression predicted identification with aggressive characters, but did not predict homophily and parasocial interaction beyond the variance explained by gender. We also observed relationships among the dependent variables and differences between physical and verbal aggression.",
Racial homophily and its persistence in newcomers' social networks,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,MAR-APR 2003,2003,"This study examined the formation and persistence of homophilous, or same-race, friendship ties among racial minorities and whites in a ""newcomer"" setting. Homophilous ties provide valuable sources of mutual support but may limit racial minorities' access to. resources and information in organizations. Study participants were first-year MBA students who entered a program at the same time. We measured network ties at two times: six weeks after the beginning of the students' first semester in the program, and at the beginning of the following semester 31 months after the second survey. We also administered a separate survey measuring social identity salience prior to the first network survey.Despite the fact that there were fewer same-race ties for racial minorities to choose from, their friendship networks demonstrated greater homophily than those of whites early in the formation of the network and over time. Also, African-Americans were more likely than whites to seek out homophilous friendship ties in other class sections. Race as a salient social identity group membership was positively related to homophily for African-Americans, Hispanics, and whites. Over the time period studied there was no significant change in homophily among the racial groups' networks, despite the explicit promotion of diversity in recruitment of students, formation of heterogeneous classes and teams, and active support by the MBA program administrators. We discuss the practical implications of our findings for organizations that are attempting to increase cultural diversity and promote active interaction among individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.",
Informal HIV caregiving in a vulnerable population: toward a network resource framework,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,Mar 2003,2003,"For the impoverished and often stigmatized communities most affected by HIV/AIDS, needs for informal caregiving present tremendous demands on already limited resources. Traditional theoretical frameworks emphasize care needs as driving informal caregiving. The proposed theoretical framework emphasizes microsocial processes that may affect informal caregiving among economically disadvantaged populations. The study examined: (1) network structural factors (homophily) that may affect availability of ties and local sociocultural expression of ties (social roles, behavioral norms) and (2) the role of financial resources in enabling informal caregiving.Low income, African American injection drug using persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) and their primary HIV supporters were interviewed. Supporters were predominantly female (71%), consanguineal kin (59%) and partners or friends (41 %). Compared to the general US population, supporters were disproportionately HIV-infected, drug using, African Americans of poor health and low socioeconomic status. Supporters who perceived their PLHA tie needed informal care, compared to those who perceived no care need, were more than twice as likely to report a history of drug use, functional limitation (IADLs), higher income, and PLHA's financial reliance. Supporters' reported care provision was associated with their financial resources, but not PLHAs' health status. PLHAs' reported care receipt was associated only with their health status.HIV supporters' reported care provision was affected by financial factors, consistent with the proposed theoretical framework, while PLHAs' perceptions of care receipt conformed to traditional ""needs""-based frameworks of caregiving. Results suggest that programs are needed to bolster network financial resources of disadvantaged populations affected by HIV to promote and sustain their informal HIV caregiving. Findings may aid in the understanding of informal caregiving as a social process. Network resource-oriented research may allow for ascertainment of community caregiving capacity, and guide the development of interventions to promote HIV caregiving in disadvantaged populations.

Living across institutions: Exploring sex-based homophily in occupations and voluntary groups,SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES,SPR 2003,2003,"Occupational sex segregation is well documented. Research on voluntary associations shows that these also are segregated by sex. However, little is known about the connections between these institutions. In this research, we explore the effects of occupational sex composition on the sex composition of respondents' voluntary memberships. We find a positive relationship between the sex composition of men's occupations and the sex composition of their voluntary memberships. This effect is found for women only when full-time homemaking is considered as an occupation. We attribute differences in our findings to the nature of occupational ties in social networks.",
Individual and structural origins of friendship and social position among professionals,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,Feb 2003,2003,"Friendship affects individual and organizational well-being through direct relations, social positions, and complex network structures. In this study, the authors use longitudinal data from 2 groups of master's of business administration students to increase understanding of how friendship networks develop. The authors propose and test a dynamic model in which attribute similarity facilitates dyadic friendship ties, as well as similar network centrality and social position; early friendship increases later similarity in structural position and centrality; and early structural similarity enhances the likelihood of future friendship. Findings largely supported the model, demonstrating how homophily and early social contacts can jointly shape maturing friendship networks.",
Interpersonal communication structure and the spread of clones of group A Streptococcus (GAS) between children of a day care center.,Abstracts of the General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology,2003,2003,"The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the spread of GAS clones and the interpersonal communication structure in children from a day care center. After obtaining signed parental consent, a microbiologic survey to detect nasopharyngeal carriers of GAS among children 3 to 4 years old and from two rooms (room B; n=35) and (room C; n=37) was performed during October 31st to November 7th, 2001. Polymorphisms of DNA from GAS isolates were analyzed by comparing the RFLP patterns of the VIR regulon. Social network evaluations were performed by one investigator (blinded for the culture result) who interviewed the persons in charge of the children by asking the question ""with whom does the child have the most communication?"" The question was applied to a list of ten ranked best friends of each child. Answers of each ""friend"" were ranged as frequent, some, or little. Description of frequencies and network structure coefficients (density and centrality: degree, betweenness and eigenvector) were compared in children with and without a GAS isolate using UCINET V package. GAS was isolated in 2/35 (5.7%) and in 9/37 (24.3%) children from rooms B and C respectively. Four different clones were identified; clone I in five children from room C, clone II in two from room C and one from room B, clone III in one child from room B and one from room C, and clone IV in a single child from room C. Social network structure: Density=0.33+-0.44; the homophily pattern of interaction was different in carriers (0.44), non carriers (0.64) and mix (0.15), (p=0.001). In 4/5 children with clone I, the values of degree, betweenness and eigenvector were above the mean. In 3/3 children with clone II, values of degree and betweenness were also above the mean. In the two children with clone III and in the one child with clone IV, the values of degree, betweenness and eigenvector were below the mean. The most widely distributed clones (I and II) were associated with those children having the highest centrality levels. These findings support the fact that spread of GAS between carriers in day care centers is associated on a high degree of interaction and physical contact between pairs.",
Examination of peer-group contextual effects on aggression during early adolescence,CHILD DEVELOPMENT,JAN-FEB 2003,2003,"Peer group contextual effects of aggressive behavior among middle school students (6th-8th graders) were examined using a short-term longitudinal design. More specifically, the homophily hypothesis that peer group membership influences individual-level bullying and, fighting was evaluated with multilevel sex-specific models of individual- and peer-level aggression scores. Peer groups were identified via social network analysis. lntraclass correlation coefficients yielded through hierarchical linear modeling demonstrated substantial within-group similarity on self-reported bullying and fighting, suggesting that students affiliate with individuals who bully and fight at the same frequency. Peer group bullying and fighting was associated with individual-level behavior, even after controlling individual baseline levels for males and females. However, peer contextual effects explained more variance in individual bullying than individual fighting. This differential impact of peer group membership suggests that future studies consider peer relations across subtypes of aggression.",
Polarization in dynamic networks: A hopfield model of emergent structure,DYNAMIC SOCIAL NETWORK MODELING AND ANALYSIS,2003,2003,"Why do populations often self-organize into antagonistic groups even in the absence of competition over scarce resources? Is there a tendency to demarcate groups of ""us"" and ""them'' that is inscribed in our cognitive architecture? We look for answers by exploring the dynamics of influence and attraction between computational agents. Our model is an extension of Hopfield's attractor network. Agents are attracted to others with similar states (the principle of homophily) and are also influenced by others, as conditioned by the strength and valence of the social tie. Negative valence implies xenophobia (instead of homophily) and differentiation (instead of imitation). Consistent with earlier work on structural balance, we find that networks can self-organize into two antagonistic factions, without the knowledge or intent of the agents. We model this tendency as a. function of network size, the number of potentially contentious issues, and agents' openness and flexibility toward alternative positions. Although we find that polarization into two antagonistic groups is a unique global attractor, we investigate the conditions under which uniform and pluralistic alignments may also be equilibria. From a random start, agents can self-organize into pluralistic arrangements if the population size is large relative to the size of the state space.",
Social networks and changes in contraceptive use over time: Evidence from a longitudinal study in rural Kenya,DEMOGRAPHY,Nov 2002,2002,"The impacts of social networks on changes in contraception in rural Kenya are investigated using special data from a longitudinal household survey. An analytic model, informed by detailed knowledge of the setting, yielded estimates that indicate that (1) social networks have substantial effects even after unobserved factors (e.g., homophily) that may determine social networks are controlled; (2) controlling for these unobserved factors may substantially alter the estimated effects of networks (these controls were not used in previous studies); (3) network effects are important for both men and women; and (4) network effects are nonlinear and asymmetric, suggesting that networks provide information primarily through social learning, rather than by exerting social influence.",
A structural event approach to the analysis of group composition,SOCIAL NETWORKS,May 2002,2002,"Since Simmel's early work on forms of association, the processes guiding group composition have commanded considerable attention in structural sociology, but have not led to a general methodology for examining compositional properties. By introducing a structural event approach, this study offers a new technique that is not restricted to analysis of dyads or triads nor post hoc analysis of those structural arrangements that are observed in a given sample. The approach is illustrated using data on 745 organizational founding teams. Structural event analysis separates choice behavior guiding team composition (with respect to ascribed and achieved characteristics of members) from structurally-induced behavior based on contact opportunities. Results suggest that the strong impact of ascriptive homophily may be tempered where functional considerations of group composition are addressed. However, many of the other arrangements that ostensibly pass as 'functional' are in fact induced by opportunity structures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
The ties that bind: Strategic actions and status structure in the US-investment banking industry,ORGANIZATION STUDIES,2002,2002,"We applied Giddens' (1979, 1984) structuration theory to investigate the US investment banking industry and found support for the notion that industry network structure impacts the strategic actions of the firms embedded in it, and that the status hierarchy component of the industry structure is reproduced by the dyad-level interactions of firms in this industry. Investment banks conform to the homophily phenomenon - they tend to transact with others in the industry of similar status. Status ranking also enables high-status, banks to maintain an extensive exchange relationship with other banks, while status ranking constrains low-status banks to transact repeatedly with banks with which they have previously transacted.",
Personal communication networks and the effects of an entertainment-education radio soap opera in Tanzania,JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION,2001,2001,"The personal networks of listeners and nonlisteners to an entertainment-education radio soap opera in Tanzania are examined to determine the effects of interpersonal discussion of the soap opera's educational themes of family planning and HIV prevention. Listeners are more likely to discuss these two educational issues in their personal communication networks and are also more likely to have other listeners to the radio program in their personal communication networks. Respondents demonstrate a relatively high degree of homophily with their network painters and are more likely to discuss matters arising from the radio program with their network partners who are of similar tribal membership, religious affiliation, and gender, and those who are equally or more highly educated than themselves.",
Differences in normative and informational social influence,"ADVANCES IN CONSUMER RESEARCH, VOL XXVIII",2001,2001,"In an investigation of the distinctive characteristics of normative and informational social influence, a survey probed purchase decision, individual difference, and consumer-referent relationship characteristics associated with recent purchase episodes involving advice from others. Levels of involvement and complexity were shown to be greater in informational influence situations than in normative. Conspicuousness, contact and advice solicitation frequency, and consumer-referent homophily with respect to the value attached to warm relationships were greater when normative influence was involved.",
Birds of a feather: Homophily in social networks,ANNUAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY,2001,2001,"Similarity breeds connection. This principle-the homophily principle-structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.",
Mimetic trust and intra-organizational network dynamics,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY,2001,2001,"Dynamic network models based on the homophily principle are criticized for neglecting organizational context conditions and the impact of role structures on the evolution of intra-organizational trust networks. Using a neo-institutional framework it is argued that individuals in competitive environments will attempt to reduce uncertainty about the trustworthiness of potential trustees by imitating the sociometric choice behavior of persons in similar network positions. Three hypotheses are developed. The positional trust hypothesis predicts that individuals tend to trust other actors who occupy a similar network position as themselves. The mimetic trust hypothesis argues that individuals trust actors who are trusted by persons in their own network position. Finally, the advisory trust hypothesis claims that individuals prefer to maintain trust relations to persons occupying a position of third party intermediary than to persons in other positions. An exploratory empirical test of the hypotheses is carried out by reanalyzing a longitudinal network study of the relationships among 25 salesmen in the furniture department of a North American retail sales store during the 1950s. Blockmodelling procedures are used to identify structural positions in the networks, and log-linear analysis is applied to determine stability of choices within and between structural positions. The results support the mimetic trust and the advisory trust hypothesis.",
"Race, homophily, and purchase intentions and the black consumer",PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING,Oct 2000,2000,"Black consumers are an important market for advertisers to reach. However, designing effective communication strategies is difficult. This study examines the moderation effect of ethnic identification (strength of identity with other blacks) on the tie between advertising stimuli (with racially congruent or incongruent actors) and the subject's perceived homophily (similarity) toward actors featured in ads, and if perceived homophily influences purchase intentions regarding advertised products. ANOVA found a significant interaction between ethnic identity and racial congruity on the perceived level of homophily. In addition, a simple effect for racial congruity on perceived homophily was found. Regression analysis subsequently found a significant effect for the level of perceived homophily on the level of purchase intent. Strategic considerations for marketing advertisers and future research ideas are also presented. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
School racial composition and adolescent racial homophily,SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY,Sep 2000,2000,"Objective. Even though schools are characterized by an unprecedented amount of racial diversity, it is unclear whether a racially diverse student body necessarily translates into friendships between adolescents from different racial groups. We examine how schools structure adolescent racial homophily, that is, adolescents' tendency to form friendships with students who are similar with respect to race. Methods. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine how the racial composition of schools influences the chances of having an interracial friendship for U.S. adolescents in grades seven through twelve. Results. Our results demonstrate that white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American adolescents differ greatly in their chances of having an interracial friendship. They additionally demonstrate that adolescents' chances of having an interracial friendship increase dramatically as the proportion of same-race students in their schools decreases. Finally, they suggest that school racial composition accounts for a large part of the variation in interracial friendship by race, but not for all of it. Conclusions. We conclude that racial differences in interracial friendship reflect opportunities and preferences for interracial contact.",
Gender-specific use of the domestic telephone,SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY,Sep 2000,2000,"The paper is based on a study on the uses of the telephone in 317 French homes. Detailed billing data over four months were collected and compared with interviews concerning each regular phone user in the household We focus here on the correlation between the observed duration of phone calls and the gender of callers and receivers. The reasons why women telephone more are discussed and related to the gender homophily in telephone networks. Data also show that the duration of phone calls depends on the receiver's gender. We suggest that politeness rules may govern the telephone call, did we argue that these civility rules explain in part why the receiver's gender exerts the greatest effect on how the call is managed and on its overall duration We propose to explore the hypothesis that telephone calls have an interactional format similar to that of a visit, but that status differences between caller and receiver may influence the unfolding of interactions between men and women through the caller's adjustment of his or her interaction style to the receiver's gender.",
"Gender on a jagged edge - The security industry, its clients, and the reproduction and revision of gender",WORK AND OCCUPATIONS,Aug 2000,2000,"The security industry has seen an influx of women in recent decades. Although some have been resegregated into relatively poorly rewarded jobs seen as suitable for women, some have found better jobs or jobs usually seen as ""men's work."" We trace these variable outcomes to the flexibility of ideas about jobs and gender, the greater power of ideas about gender relationships, the tension between gender homophily and gender status expectations, relationships to clients and targets (people dealt with for the client), and client and target gender. Gender ideas, inequality, and segregation are both reproduced and revised in the security industry.",
Organisational sources of safety and danger: sociological contributions to the study of adverse events,QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE,Jun 2000,2000,"Organisational sociology has long accepted that mistakes of all kinds are a common, even normal, part of work. Medical work may be particularly prone to error because of its complexity and technological sophistication. The results can be tragic for individuals and families. This paper describes four intrinsic characteristics of organisations that are relevant to the level of risk and danger in healthcare settings-namely, the division of labour and ""structural secrecy"" in complex organisations; the homophily principle and social structural barriers to communication; diffusion of responsibility and the ""problem of many hands""; and environmental or other pressures leading to goal displacement when organisations take their ""eyes off the ball"". The paper argues that each of these four intrinsic characteristics invokes specific mechanisms that increase danger in healthcare organisations but also offer the possibility of devising strategies and behaviours to increase patient safety. Stated as hypotheses, these ideas could be tested empirically, thus adding to the evidence on which the avoidance of adverse events in healthcare settings is based and contributing to the development of theory in this important area.",
"Partisans, proximates, and poker players: The impact of homophily and proximity on communication patterns of state legislators",POLITY,SPR 2000,2000,"This study examined interpersonal communication patterns among 70 of 149 members in the New York State Assembly. The average member spoke frequently with about 22% of his or her colleagues, less frequently to another 44%, and virtually never to the remaining third of the membership. Shared membership in political party had the strongest relationship to communication patterns (which colleagues a member communicated with) followed by regional delegation. Seat proximity and shared committee membership showed weaker relationships, and office proximity and gender were of little influence. In general, homophilous attributes were more important than proximity factors in influencing frequency of communication. Moreover, homophily creates proximity, through meetings of party conferences, regional delegations, and groups such as the Women's Caucus.",
The persuasive effect of spokesperson similarity moderated by source credibility,2000 AMA EDUCATORS' PROCEEDINGS - ENHANCING KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT IN MARKETING,2000,2000,"The objective of this article is to investigate how spokespersons homophily with his/her audience influences purchase intentions at various degrees of spokesperson credibility. Homophily is defined as the degree to which individuals in dyads are congruent or similar on attributes, such as age, social class, and ethnicity. In this study, the Homophily Theory (Lazarsfeld and Merton 1954) is used to conceptualize the impact of the spokesperson similarity on the communication effectiveness. However, it is argued that the level of the spokesperson credibility will significantly moderate the influence of the spokesperson homophily on purchase intentions.",
Decay functions,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2000,2000,"The tendency for relationships to weaken and disappear I discuss as decay, and functions describing the rate of decay over time I discuss as decay functions. Three conclusions are supported with 4 years of network data on a study population of bankers and their colleagues in a financial organization. (1) Factors known from cross-sectional evidence to be associated with strong relationships are associated with slow decay; decay is slower in relations between colleagues with a strong prior relationship (inertia), working in the same corporate division (homophily), prominent in the social hierarchy of bankers (status), or connected indirectly through many third parties (embedding). (2) Regardless of slower decay in certain relations, decay has a pattern over time similar to the population ecology ""liability of newness"" attributed to selection and learning, with the added complication of networks and people aging simultaneously. Decay is a power function of time in which the probability of decay decreases with tie age (years for which a relationship has existed) and node age (years for which a banker has been in the study population). (3) Embedding stability is responsible for the greater stability of older relationships. The decay-inhibiting effects of age occur where embedding is disrupted but not where embedding is continuous. The third conclusion is interesting in highlighting the first derivative of social structure as a causal variable: embedding has to be measured for its change, rather than level, to see both of its distinct effects on relationship decay.

Personal network integration: transitivity and homophily in strong-tie relations,SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 2000,2000,"This article combines studies of transitivity and homophily in an empirical analysis of personal network integration. Using a national sample of individual's personal networks, the paper reveals that transitivity explains a majority of cases of network integration with two important caveats: (1) recent work on networks and social structure points to important structural constraints on personal networks that shape their formation, and (2) homophily (e.g, sex or race) and choice homophily (e.g. religion) improve the likelihood of integration in personal networks. The results indicate that the second finding interacts with relationship length and the availability of focal points to organize individual contact. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

"The interrelationship of student ratings of instructors' immediacy, verbal aggressiveness, homophily, and interpersonal attraction",COMMUNICATION EDUCATION,Oct 1999,1999,"This study explored the relationships of immediacy and verbal aggression with homophily and interpersonal attraction in the instructional context. Immediacy was negatively related to verbal aggression and positively related to all dimension; of homophily and interpersonal attraction. Verbal aggression was also found to be negatively related to both dimensions of homophily and all three dimensions of interpersonal attraction. It is recommended that the relationship between verbal aggression and immediacy be examined in greater detail, including possible interactions between these variables and various instructional outcomes.",
Differences in perceptions of communication across types of relationships,PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS,Aug 1999,1999,"This study explored four variables in interpersonal communication, i.e., Solidarity, Attitude-Value Homophily, Uncertainty, and Safety across four types of relationships.

Organization culture as a complex system: Balance and information in models of influence and selection,ORGANIZATION SCIENCE,MAY-JUN 1999,1999,"We define the complex system underlying organizational culture by incorporating the social-psychological principles of balance and information (B-I) into models of influence (changes in attitudes as a function of interaction) and selection (changes in interaction!, We identify information based influence as a potential anchor for actors' sentiments so that they are not overwhelmed by normative influence. In the model of selection, we identify the pursuit of information as an important counterbalance to the effect of homophily (interacting with others like oneself). Using the tools of dynamic systems we show how our models generate the full range of equilibria of complex systems. Through simulations we also explore how our system responds to exogenous effects.",
Context and sex effects on personal work networks,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,Feb 1999,1999,"This study tests hypotheses concerning the similarities and differences between men's and women's instrumental, expressive and overlapping work networks. The study's sample was drawn from three organizations representing distinctly different industries. As expected, women and men differed in several structural characteristics of their expressive networks but, with the exception of homophily (i.e. the number of same-sex ties), their instrumental work networks were essentially similar. In addition, there were systematic differences among the work networks of participants employed by the three organizations. The results support the general proposition that both structural differences and sex influence the patterns of people's networks in the workplace, but that a distinction must be made between individual's instrumental and expressive networks. Implications for future research, through the integration of our findings with other researchers, are addressed in the discussion.",
Racial attraction or racial avoidance in American suburbs?,SOCIAL FORCES,Dec 1998,1998,"The principle of homophily homophily is central to several social-science theories. When applied to the study of population change in geographic areas, these theories predict racial homogeneity in residential settlement patterns. The concentration of one group in an area is expected to attract same-group members while deterring others. We examine this prediction using data on 1980-90 population change for four ethnic groups in 1,672 U.S. suburban cities. The findings from our analysis contradict the principle of homophily. For example, during the 1980s, black populations grew faster in those suburbs that had smaller, rather than larger, percentages of blacks. We explain these findings by spatial-assimilation and place-stratification models, Minority suburbanization is viewed as a process driven primarily by status rather than by ethnic considerations.",
The employment of women managers and professionals in an emerging economy: Gender inequality as an organizational practice,ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY,Sep 1998,1998,"The study reported here uses the recent rapid growth in labor demand in an emerging economy to isolate the organizational forces determining the representation of women in high-skill jobs from labor supply factors. We test key predictions drawn from three theoretical perspectives: according to market incentive theories, firms are motivated to use human resources, including high-skill women, optimally; according to cultural theories, core national values can affect organizational gatekeepers' practices, while social psychological studies suggest that employees' preference for social homophily can make discriminatory behavior efficient. Analysis of original survey data on 114 multinational firms headquartered in the U.S. and Japan and 40 domestic companies operating in Thailand shows ambiguous market incentives to firms and no impact of national values on the employment of women. The results point to male employees' preferences as the basis of gender inequality as an organizational practice.",
A dyadic study of interpersonal information search,JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE,SPR 1998,1998,"Although interpersonal word-of-mouth communication, by definition, takes place between two people, rarely has the phenomenon of word of mouth been studied using both members of the dyad Building on the literature, this article offers a model of active interpersonal information search that is tested by using a method in which information seeker and source perceptions were obtained. Source characteristics were important determinants of interpersonal influence, but seeker characteristics also played an important role. Interestingly, it proved useful to distinguish between demographic and attitudinal homophily of seeker and source as the former was inversely and the latter directly related to interpersonal influence.",
"Effective HIV/AIDS prevention communication strategies to reach culturally unique populations: Lessons learned in San Francisco, USA and Bangkok, Thailand",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS,Feb 1998,1998,"Our research in San Francisco and Bangkok was purposely designed to achieve both applied and theoretical results. Specially, we analyzed the extent to which relatively more effective and relatively less effective HIV/AIDS prevention programs in San Francisco and Bangkok use diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers, 1995) and social marketing theory, (Kotler & Roberto, 1989) in reaching culturally unique populations. We trace the history of HIV/AIDS in San Francisco and Bangkok and indicate why it is relevant to study the application of these two theoretical models to culturally-unique populations. Our findings indicate that key concepts of the diffusion of innovations model (for example, homophily) and social marketing theory (for example, audience segmentation) are especially important in designing culturally sensitive and effective HIV/AIDS prevention programs. Implications of our results for practitioners are outlined here. In sum, when working with culturally unique populations to prevent the spread of HIV, program administrations should: (1) segment their audience clearly and attempt to offer. depth rather than breadth iii the types of people reached, (2) use outreach workers who are either homophilous with the intended audience members or are opinion leaders in the community, and (3) create a program that is compatible with the values and beliefs of the audience members.

The value of similar others in the networks of recent widows,JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS,Dec 1997,1997,"Contacts with other widows are often seen as having particular value for those who are coping with bereavement. Both the benefits of associating with other widows and the difficulties of maintaining ties with married friends make it likely that recent widows' friendship networks will show increasing 'homophily', based on substituting widowed friends for married friends. We investigated these issues based on a year of longitudinal interviewing with 321 recently widowed women, aged 59-85 years, who provided data about their social support networks, Our results indicate that these widows did shift their networks toward greater association with others who had experienced this life event. We did not, however, find evidence that this was due to the amount or quality of the support they received from widowed rather than married friends. One possible explanation is that widows' preference for associating with their similar others has more to do with the nature of the companionship they share in such relationships, rather than with the provision of social support.",
Homophily or the Queen Bee Syndrome - Female evaluation of female leadership,SMALL GROUP RESEARCH,Nov 1997,1997,"Nontraditional and traditional women were placed into groups, with both nontraditional and traditional women as lenders, and assigned a simple sorting task Results indicate that (a) nontraditional women evaluated female leadership in general more positively than did traditional women, (b) traditional women responded more positively to their own experience of traditional leadership than did nontraditional women, and (c) nontraditional women responded more positively to their own experience of nontraditional leadership than to traditional leadership. This study failed to substantiate the hypothesized higher evaluation of traditional leadership over nontraditional leadership among traditional women, lending some support to the Queen Bee Syndrome theory of female competition. The significant results of this-study suggest the validity of distinguishing between women who reject traditional sex roles and women who accept traditional sex roles when examining gender in communication research.",
The sex of the service provider: Does it influence perceptions of service quality?,JOURNAL OF RETAILING,FAL 1997,1997,"This work builds on recent streams of research on both service quality and the relationships between consumption and gender. It explores whether the sex of the service provider should be regarded as art element of the servicescape that influences perceptions of service quality in the contexts of fast food restaurants hair cutting salons, and dental offices. For each setting, two possibilities were explored. The first was that men might believe male servers provide higher quality and women believe female servers did, due to in-group bias or homophily based perceptions. The second was that consumers' ''server stereotypes'' concerning which sex does a better job of serving in a particular setting would interact with the sex of the service provider to influence perceived quality. Across the three settings studied server stereotypes were found to interact with sex of server and/or sex of consumer to affect ratings of some dimensions of service quality. The reasons for and implications of the inconsistent effects of stereotypes are addressed.",
Explanations of managerial career advancement,AUSTRALIAN PSYCHOLOGIST,Mar 1997,1997,"This article reviews and evaluates major theories explaining managerial career advancement, and summarises findings from recent empirical research. The major theories include organisational theories of internal labor markets, career tournaments, statistical discrimination, and resource dependency; interpersonal theories of mentors, informal social networks, homophily, and politics; and individual theories of leadership traits (ambition, motivation to manage, general cognitive ability, instrumentality), human capital, managerial skills, and multiple roles. An integration is presented to show how the theories and empirical research fit together. Methodological issues in research on managerial advancement are discussed.",
Paving an alternative route: Gender differences in managerial networks,SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY,Mar 1997,1997,"This research uses the network-analytic concepts of homophily, tie strength, and range to explore gender differences in characteristics of middle managers' information and career support networks. When the effects of position and potential for future advancement were held constant, women's networks were less homophilous than men's. Women high in advancement potential, however, relied to a greater extent than both high-potential men and less high-potential women on close ties and relationships outside their subunits. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that different types of networks may provide alternative routes to similar career resources for men and for women.",
"Once a friend, always a friend? Effects of homophily on women's support networks across a decade",SOCIAL NETWORKS,Jan 1997,1997,"This study uses data collected on 42 women and 432 members of their social networks across a 10-year period beginning with the women's return to school in midlife. The paper addresses three questions: (1) To what extent did the same individuals continue to be active members of the women's social support networks across the decade; (2) to what extent did educational similarity explain which individuals continued to be active members of the women's networks; and (3) did educational similarity explain patterns of both support and socializing? The analyses revealed that between one-quarter and one-third of the associates named as sources of school/work support, general emotional support or socializing continued to be named 10 years after the first interview. The analyses also demonstrated that associates' educational attainment was important in explaining which individuals continued to serve as sources of support for school/work; however, educational attainment was not important in explaining which associates continued to serve as sources of either general emotional support or socializing.",
Social marketing and diffusion-based strategies for communicating with unique populations: HIV prevention in San Francisco.,Journal of health communication,1996 Oct-Dec,1996,"We conducted a 2-year investigation of the extent to which strategies based on social marketing and diffusion of innovations concepts are used in preventive health communication with unique (highly ostracized) populations. Of the 49 organizations in San Francisco that operate HIV prevention programs (N = 100), programs that most highly targeted unique populations were surveyed. Personal interviews were then conducted with 38 staff leaders who operated the most and least effective programs. Audiotapes and transcripts were content analyzed to identify the strategies used by program staff. Strategies based on social marketing concepts were more prevalent than strategies based on the diffusion of innovations: More effective programs were characterized by emphasis on homophily, audience segmentation, compatibility-based strategies, and interorganizational collaboration.",
Fashion in the classroom: Effects of attire on student perceptions of instructors in college classes,COMMUNICATION EDUCATION,Apr 1996,1996,"This study was conducted to investigate contemporary effects of instructor attire (specifically, graduate teaching assistant attire) on students' perception of college teachers in a live lecture context. Effects of three dress conditions, formal professional, casual professional, and casual, were tested under tightly controlled experimental conditions. Results indicated that more formal dress (business suits, dress shoes) was associated with increased ratings of instructor competence, particularly for female students rating female instructors. However, contrary to common assumptions, the most positive influences of instructor dress were found in the highly casual condition (faded jeans, T-shirt,flannel shirt). Perceptions of homophily accounted for a small amount of variance in instructor ratings, but there was no significant effect of dress condition on ratings of homophily. Overall findings suggest that caution be used in drawing conclusions regarding potential payoffs of professional classroom dress based upon literature not specifically concerned with the classroom context.",
Social relationships of students with exceptionalities in mainstream classrooms: Social networks and homophily,EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN,MAR-APR 1996,1996,"This study explored the social affiliations of students in three mainstream classrooms containing students receiving general education services, students characterized as academically gifted, students with learning disabilities, and students with emotional and behavioral disorders. The study provided an in-depth description of the the classrooms' social networks, focusing on the social and demographic characteristics that distinguished clusters of students. Findings showed that students formed distinct peer clusters around shared characteristics; particular social characteristics were associated with a student's level of centrality, in the classroom; and student's with exceptionalities were well integrated into the classroom's social structure. Affiliations of students with exceptionalities suggest topics for future research.",
HOMOPHILY OF INTERNALIZED DISTRESS IN ADOLESCENT PEER GROUPS,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,Nov 1995,1995,"This study examined various hemophilic mechanisms by which adolescents affect, and are affected by, levels of internalized distress within their immediate peer groups. The sample included approximately 6,000 14- to 18-year-olds who were assessed twice over a 1-year period. Results showed that adolescents tend to associate with peers who report similar levels of internalized distress and that internalizers are no less successful than others at establishing friendships. Moreover, homophily of internalizing symptoms develops from 3 distinct sources: (a) Adolescents tend to choose friends who possess similar levels of internalized distress (selection effect); (b) in male, but not female, peer groups, individual distress levels grow increasingly similar to peer levels over time (socialization effect); and (c) peer group distress levels vary according to the distress of individual members (contagion effect).",
"RELIGIOUS SOCIALIZATION, DENOMINATIONAL MILIEUS, AND GENERATIONS",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE,Oct 1995,1995,"The decay of denominational milieus and the decreasing success of religious socialization are processes often observed. This article first analyzes the relationship between the religiosity of parents and their children in two successive generations. In a second step religious homophily of non-kin ties between individuals who belong either to the pre-war or the post-war generation are compared. In accordance with secularization theory a declining proportion of religious individuals can be observed. At the same time the data show an intensification of religious socialization within the family and a growing tendency toward religiously homogenous ties. Thus, the empirical results suggest an intergenerational increase in religious homophily both in kin and non-kin relationships.",
CONCURRENT PARTNERSHIPS AND TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS IN NETWORKS,SOCIAL NETWORKS,JUL-OCT 1995,1995,"Network structure plays a critical role in channeling person-to-person transmission of infectious disease agents like HIV. Stochastic simulations are used here to examine the effect of two structural attributes: concurrent partnerships (degree) and mixing patterns (degree-based homophily bias). Four alternative partnership scenarios are compared: (1) sequential monogamy, and concurrent partnerships with (2) random (3) assortative and (4) disassortative mixing by degree. Concurrent partnerships are found to dramatically increase the speed and pervasiveness of epidemic spread, and the implications for HIV transmission are discussed.",
WHEN EXPERIENCE COUNTS - THE EFFECTS OF EXPERIENTIAL AND STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY ON PATTERNS OF SUPPORT AND INTERPERSONAL STRESS,SOCIAL FORCES,Jun 1995,1995,"Previous research has suggested that individuals benefit from having associates who are similar to themselves on a variety of dimensions. This article develops a theoretical basis for predicting which types of similarity are most important in determining whether associates will be sources of social support or interpersonal stress. Drawing upon theories of homophily and reference groups, we suggest that experiential similarity (e.g., having experienced a similar status transition) is more important than structural similarity (e.g., similarity of age, gender, marital status) in determining sources of emotional support and stress following life events. The theoretical arguments are supported by data from two separate longitudinal studies of social networks following status transitions; specifically, returning to school and becoming the primary caregiver to an elderly parent.",

RACE AS A FACTOR IN JOB PLACEMENT - SERENDIPITOUS FINDINGS OF ETHNIC DRIFT,PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY,FAL 1994,1994,"In the course of analyzing data from a criterion-related test validation study, an unexpected pattern of initial job placement was noticed. There was a statistically significant tendency in this large commercial bank to assign new employees to supervisors of the same ethnic group; and among those who were subsequently reassigned within 5 months, the level of such identity-based homophily increased significantly further. Four alternative nonracial hypotheses that might have explained the pattern of reassignments were investigated and rejected. At present, no explanations are available of the processes underlying the pattern of intra-organizational ''ethnic drift.'' Implications are noted for the study of cultural diversity and subgroup differences in organizations, and for the investigation of criterion relevance and test bias in validation studies.",
PEER NETWORK COMPOSITION OF ACCULTURATED AND ETHNOCULTURALLY-AFFILIATED ADOLESCENTS IN A MULTICULTURAL SETTING,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT RESEARCH,Apr 1994,1994,"This study investigated the ethnocultural composition of the peer networks of acculturated (i.e., multigeneration North American) and ethnoculturally-affiliated (i.e., immigrant/first generation) adolescents living within a multicultural context. Participants were 896 students attending a large suburban high school. This study addressed three issues. First, to elucidate patterns of intergroup social interaction in a multicultural setting, the extent to which acculuturated and ethnoculturally-affiliated youth demonstrate own-group preferences and segregation in peer group selections was examined. Results indicated that although all groups exhibited own-group preferences, they did not report segregated patterns of interaction. Second, the influence of demographic variables on the ethnocultural mix of peer networks of acculturated and ethnoculturally-affiliated adolescents was investigated. Results demonstrated that gender, age, socio-economic status, and academic level differentially predicted homophily in accordance with the ethnocultural group affiliation of the adolescent. Third, to advance our understanding of the influence of ethnocultural mix on developmentally salient aspects of adolescents' peer relations, structural characteristics of peer networks varying in levels of ethnocultural mix were examined. Results demonstrated that gender mix, setting mix, and frequency of contact significantly differed across homogeneous, integrated, and heterogeneous peer structures. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of recognizing the mitigating impact of environmental factors on the interplay between ethnocultural affiliation and peer relations.",
MARITAL HOMOPHILY ON ILLICIT DRUG-USE AMONG YOUNG-ADULTS - ASSORTATIVE MATING OR MARITAL INFLUENCE,SOCIAL FORCES,Dec 1993,1993,"We assess the similarity between marital partners on the use of illegal drugs prior to marriage and within the most recent year of marriage, and the dynamic underlying observed similarity. Similarity after marriage may result from assortative mating or socialization or both. Concordant and discordant patterns of drug use at each time between spouses/partners in a sample of 545 pairs (XBAR age husbands = 30, XBAR age wives = 28) are cross-tabulated to generate a 16-fold table. Similarity at one point in time and selection and socialization effects underlying change over time are estimated without controls for population heterogeneity through loglinear models, and with controls for heterogeneity through latent trait models. While there is evidence for assortative mating, the socialization effect documented by the loglinear models disappears in the latent trait models.",
EFFECTS OF GENERALISM AND NICHE OVERLAP ON NETWORK LINKAGES AMONG YOUTH SERVICE AGENCIES,ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL,Apr 1993,1993,"From one theoretical perspective, exchange, dissimilar organizations link together because they must acquire needed resources from each other. From another perspective, homophily, similar organizations link together to cooperate. We examined predictions based on both perspectives concerning the effects of generalism and niche overlap on interorganizational linkages among 46 youth service agencies. Generalism and niche overlap were measured for clients, services, and funding. The results support the argument that similar organizations link more than the argument that dissimilar organizations link and suggest that homophily is an important determinant of interorganizational networks.",
KEIRETSU NETWORKS IN THE JAPANESE ECONOMY - A DYAD ANALYSIS OF INTERCORPORATE TIES,AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW,Oct 1992,1992,"We analyze the organization of keiretsu networks in the Japanese economy using data on the top 50 financial firms and 200 industrial corporations. Control relations between pairs of firms are modeled as a function of bilateral exchange relations and other firm- and dyad-level covariates in accordance with resource dependence and transaction cost theory. Firms with financial and commercial connections develop quasi-administrative ties through cross-shareholding and director transfers. Keiretsu networks have two sides. (1) horizontal relationships of mutual support and defense among large established firms as indicated by reciprocity of control and exchange, homophily among ""big-six"" affiliates, and symmetry in the effects of purchase/supply transactions on control; (2) vertical structures of asymmetric exchange and control between financial firms and industrial firms, large firms and small firms, and ""big-six"" firms versus independent companies.",
HOMOPHILY AND DIFFERENTIAL RETURNS - SEX-DIFFERENCES IN NETWORK STRUCTURE AND ACCESS IN AN ADVERTISING FIRM,ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY,Sep 1992,1992,"This paper argues that two network mechanisms operate to create and reinforce gender inequalities in the organizational distribution of power: sex differences in homophily (i.e., tendency to form same-sex network relationships) and in the ability to convert individual attributes and positional resources into network advantages. These arguments were tested in a network analytic study of men's and women's interaction patterns in an advertising firm. Men were more likely to form homophilous ties across multiple networks and to have stronger homophilous ties, while women evidenced a differentiated network pattern in which they obtained social support and friendship from women and instrumental access through network ties to men. Although centrality in organization-wide networks did not vary by sex once controls were instituted, relative to women, men appeared to reap greater network returns from similar individual and positional resources, as well as from homophilous relationships.",
WHO DO YOU KNOW IN THE GROUP - LOCATION OF ORGANIZATIONS IN INTERPERSONAL NETWORKS,SOCIAL FORCES,Dec 1991,1991,"This article demonstrates that interpersonal network density can serve as a resource for organizational processes. This theory relies upon the notion of organizational recruitment and the selection mechanisms of organizational ecology. Data on confiding relations between people are used to construct two demographic networks. A series of log-linear models are fitted to the data to test implications of the theory. In most cases, models which include parameters to capture the location of organizational niches significantly reduce the residual chi-square from independence and homophily models. Thus, partial support is found for the basic premise of the theory, indicating that network density does serve as a resource for organizational survival. Further avenues for research are suggested.",

BEHAVIORAL STEREOTYPY IN OLD AND YOUNG RHESUS MONKEYS MACACA-MULATTA,Primates,1982,1982,Four old (25 yr) and six young (3 yr) female rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) were observed individually in a laboratory cage with either an old or a young monkey present as a social partner. The behavioral repertoire was coded into 10 mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories. An information analysis of the individual behavior records is presented along with subject and partner age effects on the frequency of bouts and the amount of time spent in each category of behavior. Knowledge of the relative frequencies of the behaviors tells more about the behavior of young than old monkeys; and knowledge of the preceding behavior tells more about the behavior of old than young monkeys. Knowledge of the relative frequencies tells more about the behavior of both old and young monkeys with junior or elder partners than with age peers; whereas knowledge of the preceding behavior is more informative for old monkeys than for young ones regardless of the partner's age. Both old and young engaged in more affiliative behaviors with age peers than with junior or elder partners. An hypothesis is proposed which relates this social homophyly to the age difference in behavioral stereotypy.,
